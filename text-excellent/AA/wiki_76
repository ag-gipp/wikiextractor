Bricker Amendment

The Bricker Amendment is the collective name of a number of slightly different proposed <a href="Article%20Five%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">amendments</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> considered by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in the 1950s. Each of these amendments would have insulated American laws and policies from foreign influence exerted through treaties, executive agreements, international law, or the United Nations. They are named for their sponsor, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Senator <a href="John%20W.%20Bricker">John W. Bricker</a> of Ohio.

The Bricker Amendment was designed to keep world entanglements from entering into American life. American entry into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> led to a new sense of internationalism, which seemed threatening to many conservatives.

<a href="Frank%20E.%20Holman">Frank E. Holman</a>, president of the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably "<a href="Missouri%20v.%20Holland">Missouri v. Holland</a>", which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and could be used by foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a proposed constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for <a href="Article%20Five%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%23Ratification">ratification</a>.

The best-known version of the Bricker Amendment, considered by the Senate in 1953–54, declared that no treaty could be made by the United States that conflicted with the Constitution; treaties could not be self-executing without the passage of separate enabling legislation through Congress; treaties could not give Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with foreign powers.

Bricker's proposal attracted broad bipartisan support and was a focal point of intra-party conflict between the administration of president <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and the <a href="Old%20Right%20%28United%20States%29">Old Right</a> faction of conservative Republican senators. Despite the initial support, the Bricker Amendment was blocked through the intervention of President Eisenhower with then-<a href="Senate%20Minority%20Leader">Senate Minority Leader</a> <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> and failed in the Senate by a single vote in 1954. Three years later the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> explicitly ruled in "<a href="Reid%20v.%20Covert">Reid v. Covert</a>" that the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> cannot be by agreements with foreign powers. Nevertheless, Senator Bricker's ideas still have supporters, and new versions of his amendment have been reintroduced in Congress periodically.

The Bricker Amendment controversy grew from the vein of <a href="non-interventionism">non-interventionism</a>, <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, and suspicion of foreign influences that has existed from the beginnings of the American republic. "Non-interventionism was the considered response to foreign and domestic developments of a large, responsible, and respectable segment of the American people," wrote one historian of the movement.

In the 1930s, legislators of both parties opposed American involvement in the conflicts in Asia and Europe. Between 1934 and 1936, Senator <a href="Gerald%20Nye">Gerald Nye</a> held dramatic <a href="Nye%20Committee">hearings</a> attempting to show that America was forced into World War I by an alliance of arms merchants, bankers, and foreign influences. 

The <a href="Ludlow%20Amendment">Ludlow Amendment</a>, sponsored by Representative <a href="Louis%20Ludlow">Louis Ludlow</a>, a Democrat of Indiana, would require a popular vote to declare war. It narrowly failed.

As Germany defeated France in 1940, President Roosevelt proposed giving the UK munitions to fight back. Senator Wheeler declared "the <a href="Lend-Lease">lend-lease-give program</a> is the New Deal's <a href="Agricultural%20Adjustment%20Act">triple-A</a> foreign policy; it will plow under every fourth American boy." Roosevelt shot back, by denouncing “those who talk about plowing under every fourth American child, which I regard as the most untruthful, as the most dastardly, unpatriotic thing that has ever been said." To stop the movement toward war Senator Wheeler and the "Chicago Tribune" published the full text of the Army's top secret war plan <a href="United%20States%20Color-coded%20War%20Plans%23Rainbow%20plans">Rainbow 5</a> a few days before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941.

 The <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> temporarily silenced American non-interventionism; the <a href="America%20First%20Committee">America First Committee</a> disbanded within days. However, in the final days of World War II, non-interventionism began its resurgence— non-interventionists had spoken against ratification of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> but were unsuccessful in preventing the United States from becoming a founding member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. Suspicions of the U.N. and its associated <a href="international%20organization">international organization</a>s were fanned by conservatives, most notably by <a href="Frank%20E.%20Holman">Frank E. Holman</a>, an attorney from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> in what has been called a "crusade."

Holman, a <a href="Utah">Utah</a> native and <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes scholar</a>, was elected president of the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> in 1947 and dedicated his term as president to warning Americans of the dangers of "treaty law." While Article II of the United Nations Charter stated "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state," an international analogue to the <a href="Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a>, Holman saw the work of the U.N. on the proposed <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide">Genocide Convention</a> and <a href="Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and numerous proposals of the <a href="International%20Labour%20Organization">International Labour Organization</a>, a body created under the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, as being far outside the UN's powers and an invasion against American liberties.

Holman cautioned the <a href="Genocide">Genocide</a> Convention would subject Americans to the jurisdiction of foreign courts with unfamiliar procedures and without the protections afforded under the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. He said the Convention's language was sweeping and vague and offered a scenario where a white motorist who struck and killed a black child could be extradited to <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> on genocide charges. Holman's critics claimed the language was no more sweeping or vague than the state and Federal statutes that American courts interpreted every day. Duane Tananbaum, the leading historian of the Bricker Amendment, wrote "most of ABA's objections to the Genocide Convention had no basis whatsoever in reality" and his example of a car accident becoming an international incident was not possible. Eisenhower's <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Herbert%20Brownell%20Jr.">Herbert Brownell</a> called this scenario "outlandish".

But Holman's hypothetical especially alarmed <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a> who had gone to great lengths to obstruct Federal action targeted at ending the <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow</a> system of <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> in the American South. They feared that, if ratified, the Genocide Convention could be used in conjunction with the Constitution's <a href="Necessary%20and%20Proper%20Clause">Necessary and Proper Clause</a> to pass a Federal <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil rights</a> law (despite the conservative view that such a law would go beyond the <a href="enumerated%20powers">enumerated powers</a> of Article I, Section 8).

President Eisenhower's aide <a href="Arthur%20Larson">Arthur Larson</a> said Holman's warnings were part of "all kinds of preposterous and legally lunatic scares [that] were raised," including "that the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court</a> would take over our tariff and immigration controls, and then our education, post offices, military and welfare activities." In Holman's own book advancing the Bricker Amendment he wrote the U.N. Charter meant the Federal government could:

The <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, effective in 1789, gave the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">Federal government</a> power over foreign affairs and restricted the individual States' authority in this realm. <a href="Article%20One%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article I</a>, section ten provides, "no State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation" and that "no State shall, without the Consent of the Congress . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State or with a foreign Power." The Federal government's primacy was made clear in the <a href="Supremacy%20Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> of <a href="Article%20Six%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article VI</a>, which declares, "This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme Law of the land; and the Judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." While <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20United%20States">executive agreements</a> were not mentioned in the Constitution, Congress authorized them for delivery of the mail as early as 1792.

Constitutional scholars note that the supremacy clause was designed to protect the only significant treaty into which the infant United States had entered: the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> of 1783, which ended the <a href="American%20Revolution">Revolutionary War</a> and under which <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> recognized the thirteen former colonies as thirteen independent and fully sovereign states. Nonetheless, its wording ignited fear of the potential abuse of the treaty power from the beginning. For example, the <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> <a href="State%20ratifying%20conventions">ratifying convention</a> that approved the Constitution did so with a reservation asking for a constitutional amendment that
No treaties which shall be directly opposed to the existing laws of the United States in Congress assembled shall be valid until such laws shall be repealed, or made conformable to such treaty; nor shall any treaty be valid which is contradictory to the Constitution of the United States.

Early legal precedents striking down State laws that conflicted with federally negotiated international treaties arose from the peace treaty with Britain, but subsequent treaties were found to trump city ordinances, state laws on <a href="escheat">escheat</a> of land owned by foreigners and, in the 20th Century, state laws regarding tort claims. Subsequently, in a case involving a treaty concluded with the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> Indians, the Supreme Court declared "It need hardly be said that a treaty cannot change the Constitution or be held valid if it be in violation of that instrument. This results from the nature and fundamental principles of our government. The effect of treaties and acts of Congress, when in conflict, is not settled by the Constitution. But the question is not involved in any doubt as to its proper solution. A treaty may supersede a prior act of Congress, and an act of Congress may supersede a prior treaty."

Likewise, in a case regarding ownership of land by foreign nationals, the Court wrote, "The treaty power, as expressed in the constitution, is in terms unlimited, except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government, or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself, and of that of the states. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the states, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent. But, with these exceptions, it is not perceived that there is any limit to the questions which can be adjusted touching any matter which is properly the subject of negotiation with a foreign country."

Justice <a href="Horace%20Gray">Horace Gray</a>, in the Supreme Court's opinion in the 1898 citizenship case "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Wong%20Kim%20Ark">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a>", wrote "that statutes enacted by Congress, as well as treaties made by the President and Senate, must yield to the paramount and supreme law of the Constitution."

The precedent most often cited by critics of "treaty law" was "Missouri v. Holland". Congress had attempted to protect <a href="Bird%20migration">migratory birds</a> by statute, but federal and state courts declared the law <a href="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a>. The United States subsequently negotiated and ratified a treaty with Canada to achieve the same purpose, Congress then passed the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a> to enforce it. In "Missouri v. Holland", the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> upheld the constitutionality of the new law. Justice <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>, writing for the Court, declared:
Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.

Proponents of the Bricker Amendment said this language made it essential to add to the Constitution explicit limitations on the treaty-making power. <a href="Raymond%20Moley">Raymond Moley</a> wrote in 1953 that "Holland" meant "the protection of an international duck takes precedence over the constitutional protections of American citizens". In response, legal scholars such as Professor <a href="Edward%20Samuel%20Corwin">Edward Samuel Corwin</a> of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties—"under the authority of the United States"—was misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">1783 peace treaty</a> with Britain; this became "in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation". Professor <a href="Zechariah%20Chafee">Zechariah Chafee</a> of <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> wrote, "the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Framers</a> never talked about having treaties on the same level as the Constitution. What they did want was to make sure a state could no longer flout any lawful action taken by the nation". Chafee claimed that the word "Supreme", as used in Article VI, simply meant "supreme over the states".

Two additional cases frequently cited by proponents of the Amendment were both related to the <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt Administration</a>'s recognition of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> government in 1933. In the course of recognizing the USSR, letters were exchanged with the Soviet Union's foreign minister, <a href="Maxim%20Litvinov">Maxim Litvinov</a>, to settle claims between the two countries, in an agreement neither sent to the Senate nor ratified by it. In "United States v. Belmont" the constitutionality of <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20United%20States">executive agreements</a> was tested in the Supreme Court. Justice <a href="George%20Sutherland">George Sutherland</a>, writing for the majority, upheld the power of the president, finding:
That the negotiations, acceptance of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, as in the case of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.

A second case from the Litvinov Agreement, "United States v. Pink", also went to the Supreme Court. In "Pink", the New York State superintendent of insurance was ordered to turn over assets belonging to a Russian insurance company pursuant to the Litvinov assignment. The United States sued New York to claim the money held by the Insurance Superintendent, and lost in lower courts. However, the Supreme Court held New York was interfering with the President's exclusive power over foreign affairs, independent of any language in the Constitution, a doctrine it enunciated in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Curtiss-Wright%20Export%20Corp.">United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.</a>" and ordered New York to pay the money to the Federal Government. The Court declared that "the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> does not stand in the way of giving full force and effect to the Litvinov Assignment" and
The powers of the President in the conduct of foreign relations included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.

Unlike in "Pink" and "Belmont", an executive agreement on <a href="potato">potato</a> imports from Canada, litigated in "United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc.", another oft cited case, the courts declared an agreement unenforceable. In "Capps" the courts found that the agreement, which directly contradicted a statute passed by Congress, could not be enforced.

But the dissent of <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Fred%20M.%20Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a> in "<a href="Youngstown%20Sheet%20%26amp%3B%20Tube%20Co.%20v.%20Sawyer">Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer</a>" (commonly referred to as the "steel seizure case") alarmed conservatives. President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> had <a href="Nationalization">nationalize</a>d the American <a href="steel">steel</a> industry to prevent a <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> he claimed would interfere with the prosecution of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Though the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> found this illegal, Vinson's defense of this sweeping exercise of executive authority was used to justify the Bricker Amendment. Those warning of "treaty law" claimed that in the future, Americans could be endangered with the use of the executive powers Vinson supported.

Some state courts issued rulings in the 1940s and 1950s that relied on the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a>, much to the alarm of Holman and others. In "Fujii v. California", a California law restricting the ownership of land by aliens was ruled by a <a href="California%20Courts%20of%20Appeal">state appeals court</a> to be a violation of the UN Charter. In "Fujii", the Court declared "The Charter has become 'the supreme Law of the Land... any Thing in the Constitution of Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' The position of this country in the family of nations forbids trafficking innocuous generalities but demands that every State in the Union accept and act upon the Charter according to its plain language and its unmistakable purpose and intent."

However, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20California">California Supreme Court</a> overruled, declaring that while the Charter was "entitled to respectful consideration by the courts and Legislatures of every member nation," it was "not intended to supersede existing domestic legislation." Similarly, a New York trial court refused to consider the U.N. Charter in an effort to strike down <a href="Restrictive%20covenant">racially restrictive covenants</a> in housing, declaring "these treaties have nothing to do with domestic matters," citing Article 2, Section 7 of the Charter.

In another covenant case, the <a href="Michigan%20Supreme%20Court">Michigan Supreme Court</a> discounted efforts to use the Charter, saying "these pronouncements are merely indicative of a desirable social trend and an objective devoutly to be desired by all well-thinking peoples." These words were quoted with approval by the <a href="Iowa%20Supreme%20Court">Iowa Supreme Court</a> in overturning a lower court decision that relied on the Charter, noting the Charter's principles "do not have the force or effect of superseding our laws."

Following the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, various treaties were proposed under the aegis of the United Nations, in the spirit of <a href="collective%20security">collective security</a> and internationalism that followed the global conflict of the preceding years. In particular, the <a href="Genocide%20Convention">Genocide Convention</a>, which made a crime of "causing serious mental harm" to "a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group" and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which contained sweeping language about <a href="health%20care">health care</a>, <a href="employment">employment</a>, <a href="Annual%20leave">vacations</a>, and other subjects outside the traditional scope of treaties, were considered problematic by non-interventionists and advocates of <a href="limited%20government">limited government</a>.

Historian <a href="Stephen%20Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a> described the suspicions of Americans: "Southern leaders feared that the U.N. commitment to human rights would imperil segregation; the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> feared it would bring about <a href="socialized%20medicine">socialized medicine</a>." It was, the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> declared, "one of the greatest constitutional crises the country has ever faced."

Conservatives were worried that these treaties could be used to expand the power of the Federal government at the expense of the people and the states. In a speech to the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a>'s regional meeting at <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a> on April 11, 1952, <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a>, an American delegate to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, said, "Treaties make international law and they also make domestic law. Under our Constitution, treaties become the Supreme Law of the Land. They are indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws can override the Constitution." Dulles said the power to make treaties "is an extraordinary power liable to abuse."

Senator <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a>, a Republican of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, declared, "we are in a new era of international organizations. They are grinding out treaties like so many eager beavers which will have effects on the rights of American citizens." Eisenhower's <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Herbert%20Brownell%20Jr.">Herbert Brownell</a> admitted executive agreements "had sometimes been abused in the past." Frank E. Holman wrote <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a> in November 1948 regarding the dangers of the Human Rights Declaration, receiving the dismissive reply that the agreement was "merely declaratory in character" and had no legal effect. The conservative ABA called for a Constitutional amendment to address what they perceived to be a potential abuse of executive power. Holman described the threat:
More or less coincident with the organization of the United Nations a "new form" of internationalism arose which undertook to enlarge the historical concept of international law and treaties to have them include and deal with the domestic affairs and internal laws of independent nations.

Senator Bricker thought the <a href="transnational%20progressivism">"one world" movement</a> advocated by those such as <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>, Roosevelt's Republican challenger in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 election</a>, would attempt to use treaties to undermine American liberties. Conservatives cited as evidence the statement of John P. Humphrey, the first director of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights">United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a>:
What the United Nations is trying to do is revolutionary in character. <a href="Human%20rights">Human rights</a> are largely a matter of [the] relationship between the State and individuals, and therefore a matter which has been traditionally regarded as being within the domestic jurisdiction of states. What is now being proposed is, in effect, the creation of some super national supervision of this relationship.

Frank E. Holman testified before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> that the Bricker Amendment was needed "to eliminate the risk that through 'treaty law' our basic American rights may be bargained away in attempts to show our good neighborliness and to indicate to the rest of the world our spirit of brotherhood." <a href="W.L.%20McGrath">W.L. McGrath</a>, president of the Williamson Heater Company in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, told the Senate that the <a href="International%20Labour%20Organization">International Labour Organization</a>, to which he had been an American delegate, was "seeking to set itself up as a sort of international legislature to formulate socialistic laws which it hopes, by the vehicle of treaty ratification, can essentially be imposed upon most of the countries of the world."

 Republican Senator <a href="John%20W.%20Bricker">John W. Bricker</a>, an attorney, had served as <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Ohio">governor of Ohio</a> and was <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>'s running mate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">1944 campaign</a> before winning a Senate seat in the 1946 Republican landslide. Author <a href="Robert%20Caro">Robert Caro</a> declared Senator Bricker to be "a fervent admirer" of Senators <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, "whom he had three times backed for the presidential nomination," and <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, "whom he would support to the last," and stated that Bricker was "a fervent hater of foreign aid, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, and all those he lumped with <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> under the contemptuous designation of 'One Worlders'. He was the embodiment of the GOP's "<a href="Old%20Right%20%28United%20States%29">Old Guard</a>," borne out by his voting record: <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a> gave him a "zero" rating in 1949. However, Bricker was not a doctrinaire non-interventionist; he had voted in favor of the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> and the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty">North Atlantic Treaty</a>.

President Eisenhower disagreed about the necessity of the Amendment, writing in his diary in April 1953, "Senator Bricker wants to amend the Constitution . . . By and large the logic of the case is all against Senator Bricker, but he has gotten almost psychopathic on the subject, and a great many lawyers have taken his side of the case. This fact does not impress me very much. Lawyers have been trained to take either side of any case and make the most intelligent and impassioned defense of their adopted viewpoint."

Historians describe the Bricker Amendment as "the high water mark of the non-interventionist surge in the 1950s" and "the embodiment of the Old Guard's rage at what it viewed as twenty years of presidential usurpation of Congress's constitutional powers" which "grew out of sentiment both anti-Democrat and anti-presidential." Bricker's pressing the issue, wrote "Time" just before the climactic vote, was "a time-bomb threat to both <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">G.O.P.</a> unity and White House-Congressional accord." Senator Bricker warned "the constitutional power of Congress to determine American foreign policy is at stake."

In the <a href="82nd%20United%20States%20Congress">82nd Congress</a>, Senator Bricker introduced the first version of his amendment, S.J. Res. 102, drafted by Bricker and his staff. The <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> was still studying the issue of how to prevent an abuse of "treaty law" when Bricker introduced his resolution on July 17, 1951, without the ABA's involvement, but the Senator wanted to begin immediate debate on an issue he considered vital. Bricker was not trying to reverse the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Agreement</a>, in contrast to the goals of some of his conservative colleagues; he was worried most about what might be done by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> or under an <a href="Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20United%20States">executive agreement</a>. A second proposal, S.J. Res 130, was introduced by Bricker on February 7, 1952, with fifty-eight co-sponsors, including every Republican except <a href="Eugene%20Millikin">Eugene Millikin</a> of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>.

President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> was adamantly opposed to limitations on executive power and ordered every executive branch agency to report on how the Bricker Amendment would affect its work and to offer this information to the Judiciary Committee. Consequently, in its hearings, the Committee heard from representatives of the Departments of <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Agriculture</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">Commerce</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Defense</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Labor</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office</a>, along with the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Bureau of Internal Revenue</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, and the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Narcotics">Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a>. Duane Tananbaum wrote the hearings "provided the amendment's supporters with a wider forum for their argument that a constitutional amendment was needed" and gave opponents a chance to debate the issue.

Bricker's amendment was raised as an issue in his 1952 re-election campaign. <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a> mayor <a href="Michael%20DiSalle">Michael DiSalle</a> railed that the amendment was "an unwarranted interference with the provisions of the Constitution," but Bricker was easily elected to a second term.

Bricker introduced his proposal, S.J. Res 1, on the first day of the <a href="83rd%20United%20States%20Congress">83rd Congress</a> and soon had sixty-three co-sponsors on a resolution much closer to the language of the amendment proposed by the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a>. This time, every Republican senator, including Millikin, was a co-sponsor, as were eighteen Democrats. Including Bricker, this totaled exactly the sixty-four votes that comprised two-thirds of the full Senate, the number necessary to approve a constitutional amendment. Companion measures were introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, but no action was taken on them; the focus was on the Senate.

The Eisenhower Administration was caught by surprise as <a href="Sherman%20Adams">Sherman Adams</a>, Eisenhower's <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a>, thought an agreement had been reached with Bricker to delay introduction of his amendment until after the Administration had studied the issue. "Bricker hoped to force the new administration's hand," wrote Duane Tananbaum. <a href="George%20Reedy">George E. Reedy</a>, aide to Senate minority leader <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, said popular support for the measure made it "apparent from the start that it could not be defeated on a straight-out vote. No one could vote against the Bricker Amendment with impunity and very few could vote against it and survive at all . . . There was no hope of stopping it through direct opposition." Johnson told his aide <a href="Bobby%20Baker">Bobby Baker</a> it was "the worst bill I can think of" and "it will be the bane of every president we elect."

Eisenhower privately disparaged Bricker's motives, suggesting Bricker's push for the Amendment was driven by "his one hope of achieving at least a faint immortality in American history," and considered the Amendment entirely unnecessary, telling <a href="Stephen%20Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a> it was "an addition to the Constitution that said you could not violate the Constitution."

Eisenhower publicly stated his opposition in his press conference of March 26, 1953: "The Bricker Amendment, as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State, would, as I understand it, in certain ways restrict the authority that the President must have, if he is to conduct the foreign affairs of this Nation effectively. . . . I do believe that there are certain features that would work to the disadvantage of our country, particularly in making it impossible for the President to work with the flexibility that he needs in this highly complicated and difficult situation." Eisenhower's phrasing, "as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State," led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.

Eisenhower sent <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Herbert%20Brownell%20Jr.">Herbert Brownell</a> to meet with Bricker to try to delay consideration of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution. Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it "a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non-interventionists" and stating "if it is true that when you die the name of the things that bothered you the most are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion</a> and the name of Senator Bricker."

Sherman Adams wrote "Eisenhower thus found himself caught in a crossfire between the Republican conservatives and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a>" and stated President Eisenhower thought the Bricker Amendment was a refusal of America "to accept the leadership of world democracy that had been thrust upon it." In 1954, Eisenhower wrote Senate majority leader <a href="William%20F.%20Knowland">William F. Knowland</a> of <a href="California">California</a> stating, "Adoption of the Bricker Amendment in its present form by the Senate would be notice to our friends as well as our enemies abroad that our country intends to withdraw from its leadership in world affairs."

Despite the Amendment's popularity and large number of sponsors, Majority Leader Taft stalled the bill itself in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Judiciary Committee</a> at the behest of President Eisenhower. However, on June 10, ill health led Taft to resign as Majority Leader, and five days later, the Judiciary Committee reported the measure to the full Senate. No action was taken before the session adjourned in August; debate would begin in January 1954.

The long delay allowed opposition to mobilize. <a href="Erwin%20Griswold">Erwin Griswold</a>, dean of the <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>, and <a href="Owen%20Roberts">Owen Roberts</a>, retired Justice of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a>, organized the Committee for the Defense of the Constitution. They were joined by such prominent Americans as attorney <a href="John%20W.%20Davis">John W. Davis</a>, former Attorney General <a href="William%20D.%20Mitchell">William D. Mitchell</a>, former Secretary of War <a href="Kenneth%20Claiborne%20Royall">Kenneth C. Royall</a>, former First Lady <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, Governor <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20II">Adlai Stevenson</a>, former President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, Judge <a href="John%20J.%20Parker">John J. Parker</a>, former Justice <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, "<a href="The%20Denver%20Post">Denver Post</a>" publisher <a href="Palmer%20Hoyt">Palmer Hoyt</a>, the Reverend <a href="Harry%20Emerson%20Fosdick">Harry Emerson Fosdick</a>, socialist <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a>, and General <a href="Lucius%20D.%20Clay">Lucius D. Clay</a>. The Committee claimed the Amendment would give Congress too much power and make America's system to approve treaties "the most cumbersome in the world."

Roberts dismissed the Amendment, declaring "we must decide whether we are to stand on the silly <a href="shibboleth">shibboleth</a> of national security," a statement supporters of the Amendment eagerly seized upon. The Committee was joined in opposing the Amendment by the <a href="League%20of%20Women%20Voters">League of Women Voters</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Association%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">American Association for the United Nations</a>, and the <a href="Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">Association of the Bar of the City of New York</a>, one of the few bar associations to oppose the Amendment.

Conservatives <a href="Clarence%20Manion">Clarence Manion</a>, former dean of the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> Law School, and newspaper publisher <a href="Frank%20Gannett">Frank Gannett</a> formed organizations to support the Amendment while a wide spectrum of groups entered the debate. Supporting the Bricker Amendment were the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Attorneys%20General">National Association of Attorneys General</a>, the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, the <a href="Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a>, the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20League">Marine Corps League</a>, <a href="National%20Sojourners">National Sojourners</a>, the <a href="Catholic%20War%20Veterans">Catholic War Veterans</a>, the <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, the <a href="The%20National%20Grange%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Patrons%20of%20Husbandry">National Grange</a>, the <a href="American%20Farm%20Bureau%20Federation">American Farm Bureau Federation</a>, the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a>, <a href="The%20Colonial%20Dames%20of%20America">The Colonial Dames of America</a>, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals">National Association of Evangelicals</a>, the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a>, the <a href="General%20Federation%20of%20Women%27s%20Clubs">General Federation of Women's Clubs</a>, and the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons">Association of American Physicians and Surgeons</a>. In opposition were <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a>, the <a href="American%20Jewish%20Congress">American Jewish Congress</a>, the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>, <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith">B'nai B'rith</a>, the <a href="Citizens%20for%20Global%20Solutions">United World Federalists</a>, the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, and the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20University%20Women">American Association of University Women</a>: groups that Holman characterized as "eastern seaboard internationalists."

Faced with essentially united opposition from his own Party's Senate caucus, Eisenhower needed the help of Democrats to defeat the Amendment. Caro summarized the problem: "Defeating the amendment and thereby preserving the power of the presidency—his first objective—could not be accomplished even if he united his party's liberal and moderate senators against it; there simply were not enough of them. He would have to turn conservative Senators against it too, conservatives who were at the moment wholeheartedly for it—and not just Democratic conservatives but at least a few members of the Republican Old Guard." President Eisenhower continued his opposition. In January, he claimed that the Bricker Amendment would fatally weaken the bargaining position of the United States because the states would be involved in foreign policy, recalling the divisions under the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>.

Before the Second Session of the 83rd Congress convened, the Amendment "went through a complex and incomprehensible series of changes as various Senators struggled to find a precise wording that would satisfy both the President and Bricker." In fact, President Eisenhower himself in January 1954 said that nobody understood the Bricker Amendment, but his position "was clear; he opposed any amendment that would reduce the President's power to conduct foreign policy." In his opposition to the Amendment, Eisenhower obtained the help of Senate Minority Leader <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, who persuaded Senator <a href="Walter%20F.%20George">Walter F. George</a> of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to sponsor his own proposal in order to sap support from Senator Bricker's. The George Substitute introduced on January 27, 1954, especially infuriated Bricker since George also wanted limits on treaties.

George warned in the Senate, "I do not want a president of the U.S. to conclude an executive agreement which will make it unlawful for me to kill a cat in the back alley of my lot at night and I do not want the President of the U.S. to make a treaty with India which would preclude me from butchering a cow in my own pasture." Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> and his survival of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s unsuccessful effort to purge him when he sought re-election in 1938. "Democrats and Republicans alike respected him and recognized his influence."

Eisenhower worked to prevent a vote, telling Republican Senators that he agreed that President Roosevelt had done things he would not have done, but that the Amendment would not have prevented the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Agreement</a>. By the time the Senate finally voted on the Bricker Amendment on February 26, thirteen of the nineteen Democrats who had co-sponsored it had withdrawn their support, at the urging of Senators Johnson and George. The original version of S.J. Res. 1 failed 42–50. By a 61-30 vote, the Senate agreed to substitute George's language for Bricker's— if only ninety-one senators voted, sixty-one was the necessary two-thirds vote for final approval.

Senator <a href="Herbert%20H.%20Lehman">Herbert H. Lehman</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> said in the debate "what we are doing is one of the most dangerous and inexcusable things that any great legislative body can do." However, Johnson had planned carefully and had several votes in reserve. When revised Amendments came to a vote, with <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> presiding over the Senate, Senator <a href="Harley%20M.%20Kilgore">Harley M. Kilgore</a> of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> arrived to cast the deciding vote of "nay." The measure was defeated 60-31. In the final count, thirty-two Republicans voted for the revised Bricker Amendment and fourteen voted against.

Senator Bricker was embittered by the defeat. "By the mid-1950s," wrote the Senator's biographer, "Bricker had become alienated from the mainstream of his own party... fulminating on the far right of the political spectrum." Decades after his defeat he was still furious. "Ike did it!" he said. "He killed my amendment."

Eisenhower made defeating the amendment a high priority. However to secure enough Republican votes he had to abandon American support for the UN human rights initiative. This episode proved to be the last hurrah for the isolationist Republicans, as the younger conservatives increasingly turned to an internationalism based on aggressive anti-communism, typified by Senator <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>.

Senator Bricker introduced another proposal later in the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action and the idea of amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in "<a href="Reid%20v.%20Covert">Reid v. Covert</a>".

The Supreme Court in 1957 declared that the United States could not abrogate the rights guaranteed to citizens in the Bill of Rights through international agreements. "<a href="Reid%20v.%20Covert">Reid v. Covert</a>" and "Kinsella v. Krueger" concerned the prosecution of two servicemen's wives who killed their husbands abroad and were, under the <a href="status%20of%20forces%20agreement">status of forces agreement</a>s in place, tried and convicted in American <a href="court-martial">courts-martial</a>. The Court found the Congress had no constitutional authority to subject servicemen's dependents to the <a href="Uniform%20Code%20of%20Military%20Justice">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> and overturned the convictions. Justice <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a>'s opinion for the Court declared:
In "Seery v. United States" the government argued that an executive agreement allowed it to confiscate property in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> owned by an American citizen without compensation. But this was rejected, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Claims">Court of Claims</a> writing "we think that there can be no doubt that an executive agreement, not being a transaction which is even mentioned in the Constitution, cannot impair constitutional rights."

The United States ultimately ratified the U.N.'s Genocide Convention in 1986. The Convention was signed with <a href="reservation%20%28law%29">reservation</a>s, which prevented the law being enacted if it contradicted the Constitution. Several states expressed concern that this would undermine the provisions of the convention.

The Bricker Amendment is occasionally revived in Congress. For example, in 1997, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="Helen%20Chenoweth-Hage">Helen Chenoweth</a> (<a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">R</a>–<a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>) offered her version of the Bricker Amendment in the <a href="105th%20United%20States%20Congress">105th Congress</a>.

Roderic Dallas

Roderic Stanley (Stan) Dallas, (30 July 1891 – 1 June 1918) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of World War I. His score of aerial victories is generally regarded as the second-highest by an Australian, after <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert Little</a>, but there is considerable dispute over Dallas's exact total. While his official score is commonly given as 39, claim-by-claim analyses list as few as 32, and other research credits him with over 50, compared to Little's official tally of 47. Like Little, Dallas flew with British units, rather than the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>. Beyond his personal combat record, Dallas achieved success as a squadron leader, both in the air and on the ground. He was also an influential tactician and test pilot. His service spanned almost the entirety of World War I fighter aviation.

Born on a remote property in rural <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Dallas showed an early interest in aviation. He travelled to England at his own expense following the outbreak of World War I and became a pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> (RNAS) in August 1915. Initially seeing action with No. 1 Naval Wing on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in <a href="Caudron%20G.4">Caudrons</a> and <a href="Nieuport%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B11">Nieuport 11</a>s, he was chosen to test one of the earliest <a href="Sopwith%20Triplane">Sopwith Triplane</a>s. This became his favourite type, and he achieved many victories with it through 1916–17, earning the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, and the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a>. He was appointed commanding officer of <a href="No.%20201%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 1 Squadron RNAS</a> in June 1917. On the establishment of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> on 1 April 1918, he took command of <a href="No.%2040%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 40 Squadron</a>. Flying <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s, he achieved further victories before being killed in action on 1 June 1918 while on patrol near <a href="Li%C3%A9vin">Liévin</a> in northern France. He was buried in <a href="Pernes%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Pernes</a>.

Stan Dallas was born on 30 July 1891 at Mount Stanley <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">station</a> outside <a href="Esk%2C%20Queensland">Esk</a>, Queensland, to labourer Peter MacArthur Dallas and his wife Honora. Mount Stanley was an isolated property, and journeys to and from Esk were long and infrequent; Stan was the first Caucasian child born at the station. His family moved to <a href="Tenterfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tenterfield</a>, New South Wales, soon after the birth of his younger brother in 1893. They returned to Queensland in 1898, settling in Mount Morgan, where Peter Dallas became a shift boss at the local mines. Stan attended Mount Morgan Boy's School from February 1899 and eventually joined its <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadet corps</a>, rising to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>. At school he was noted for his intelligence, ability to get along well with others, and quiet sense of humour. He enjoyed the outdoors, and spent many hours in the mountains behind his family's home, observing <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>.

In July 1907, Dallas joined the <a href="assay%20office">assay office</a> of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, and also enrolled in the local technical college, where he took night classes in chemistry and technical drawing. He showed an early interest in aviation, fuelled by the establishment in 1911 of the Mount Morgan chapter of the Queensland Aero Club. Dallas and his younger brother Norvel built a glider, which was wrecked by an untimely gust of wind the first time they tried to launch it. The two brothers continued to build model gliders in spite of this initial disaster, and Stan corresponded with pioneer aviators in France, England, and the United States. He later transferred to a higher-paying job driving trucks for Iron Island ironstone quarries. Stan and Norvel once again built their own flying machine while Stan was working on Iron Island. They experimented with this seaplane on nearby Marble Island, notorious for its treacherous waters; Stan lost this aeroplane in the sea.

At tall, and weighing , Dallas would later surprise observers with his ability to fit into the cramped cockpits of fighter planes. Despite his size, he was considered a fine athlete with quick reflexes. Although he could project a loud speaking voice, he was generally soft-spoken and was not known to curse or drink alcohol, nor often to smoke. Dallas stayed fit through regular exercise at the gym, and played <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> football. He had exceptionally keen eyesight, which he had trained by reading small print in newspapers at the six-foot length of his family's table. To balance out athletics, he participated in amateur theatrics, where his strong voice served him well.

Dallas joined the <a href="Port%20Curtis">Port Curtis</a> <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> in 1913, and was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> prior to the outbreak of World War I. Believing he had little chance of gaining a place in the recently established <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>, he applied to join the British <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC), but was rejected. Undaunted, he travelled from Queensland to Melbourne, where he impressed Minister Without Portfolio <a href="Jens%20Jensen%20%28politician%29">J.A. Jensen</a>. Jensen gave the young aspirant a letter of introduction to the Australian High Commissioner in London, <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Sir George Reid</a>. Dallas paid his own passage to England and, once there, applied once more to the RFC. Rejected again, he turned to the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> (RNAS) and was accepted, topping the entrance examination over 83 other students. He was commissioned a <a href="Sub-lieutenant">flight sub-lieutenant</a> and began training at <a href="Hendon%20Aerodrome">Hendon</a> in June 1915, gaining Pilot's License #1512 on 5 August.

On 3 December 1915, Dallas joined No. 1 Naval Wing and began flying combat missions in single-seat <a href="Nieuport%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B11">Nieuport 11</a> fighters and two-seat <a href="Caudron%20G.4">Caudrons</a> out of <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, France. Early in his career there, a practical joker imitating the commanding officer telephoned Dallas, who was the duty officer, and peremptorily ordered him to take off in a propellerless <a href="Breguet%20Aviation">Breguet</a>. Upon learning that he had been tricked, Dallas joined in the laughter. He not only accepted the resulting nickname of "Breguet", but also used it as a signature on his letters home later in the war. Having made two unconfirmed claims in February 1916, Dallas scored his first confirmed victory on 23 April. He outmaneuvred a German <a href="Aviatik">Aviatik C</a> and shot it out of control, following his victim down to 2,000 feet, though heavy anti-aircraft fire holed his plane in several places. He went on to score three more confirmed victories with his Nieuport.
On 23 June 1916, Dallas took delivery of the newest RNAS fighter, <a href="Sopwith%20Triplane">Sopwith Triplane</a> #N500. This was the original prototype, having undergone <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> trials before being shipped to France. Though still only a test plane, it was flown into combat 15 minutes after its arrival. Dallas named it "Brown Bread", and it was the first of a series of 'Tripes' that he would fly and fight in over the next year. He achieved his first victory with "Brown Bread" on 1 July, the same day he was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>. Three days later, he was recommended for further promotion. He scored his last Nieuport-mounted 'kill' on 9 July, earning the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a> and a <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mention in despatches</a> for coming to the aid of a French <a href="Farman%20Aviation%20Works">Maurice Farman</a> biplane. On 7 September 1916, Dallas was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, "for the specially gallant manner in which he has carried out his duties" since first seeing action in December 1915. By the end of the year he was among the earliest RNAS aces, with eight confirmed and four unconfirmed victories, and had been raised to the rank of <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a>.

Dallas became one of the best-known pilots of Sopwith Triplanes in the RNAS. He opened 1917 by setting an altitude record of 26,000 feet in the Triplane while testing a prototype oxygen set; he endured frostbite and oxygen intoxication in the process. By now No. 1 Wing's fighter squadron had been renumbered as <a href="No.%20201%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 1 Squadron RNAS</a>, and had totally re-equipped with production Triplanes. It also shifted airfields from <a href="Veurne">Veurne</a> in Belgium to <a href="Chipilly">Chipilly</a> in France, leaving behind RNAS control by transferring to No. 14 Wing, 4th Brigade of the RFC. Formation flying became the order of the day, as the practice of fighter pilots soloing into combat dwindled. The last three weeks of March were also filled with Dallas's responsibilities for flight and gunnery testing. As British losses in the air began to mount during <a href="Bloody%20April">Bloody April</a>, Dallas and his squadron moved airfields once again, to La Bellevue. They were thus positioned to take a prominent part in the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>, where the intense aerial fighting saw Dallas add to his burgeoning score. The combat of 23 April became known as one of the classic air battles of the war. Dallas and his wingman <a href="Thomas%20Culling">Thomas Culling</a> took on a squadron-sized formation of 14 German aircraft, having gained an altitude edge over their foes. The naval aces exploited this edge by making quick diving attacks from opposite sides, culminating in short bursts of machine-gun fire. Using the Triplane's superior climbing ability, they would then bob back up to position themselves for the next assault. In contrast to the usual hit-and-run tactics of most dogfights, the RNAS duo launched at least 20 gunnery runs over 45 minutes. The Germans were forced progressively lower, into disarray, and then chased back over their own lines. While they shot down three of the Germans, Dallas and Culling also achieved a more important outcome by blocking and then breaking up a determined enemy effort against the British ground offensive. The action led to the award of a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to the Distinguished Service Cross for Dallas, and a Distinguished Service Cross for Culling, which were gazetted on 29 June.

By June 1917, Dallas had achieved over 20 victories in aerial combat. This experience, and his leadership ability, led to his appointment as commanding officer of No. 1 Naval Squadron on 23 June 1917. The unit had been forced to cut back its operational strength from 18 aircraft to 15 due to lack of pilot replacements and a shortage of spare parts for the aging Triplanes. It had also moved airfields, to an unprepared site at <a href="Bailleul%2C%20Somme">Bailleul</a>. As a leader, Dallas made a point of shepherding new pilots through their first flights, and even setting them up with their first victories by manoeuvring enemy aircraft into a good position for the rookie to take a shot. On the ground, he proved to be an efficient organiser, designing and directing construction of the new air base. It was also during this time that he wrote a treatise on air combat tactics, extracts of which have survived. Both the air base layout and the treatise displayed his talent as a sketch artist. On 2 November, No. 1 Squadron moved airfields once more, to Middle Aerodrome, which put it back under overall RNAS control. The unit received its first eight new <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s on 9 November as replacements for the Triplanes. On 11 November, Dallas was again mentioned in despatches, this time by Field Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Haig</a>. After gaining its full complement of Camels, No. 1 Squadron was transferred to England, and took up home defence duties at <a href="Dover">Dover</a>. On 16 February 1918, Dallas led his squadron back to France, where it was based at <a href="T%C3%A9teghem">Téteghem</a>, supporting units on operations along the Belgian coast. He commanded it for another six weeks, until 31 March.

As part of the amalgamation of the RFC and RNAS to form the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, on 1 April 1918 Dallas was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> and given command of <a href="No.%2040%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 40 Squadron RAF</a>, flying <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s. The squadron boasted several aces in its ranks, and its former RFC members were suspicious of Dallas's naval background. He was nevertheless able to overcome their misgivings and established himself as the new CO with his personal demeanour and courage; the nickname of "Admiral" that they bestowed upon him was an affectionate one. Ten days after taking over, he had adapted well enough to his new mount with its <a href="Inline%20engine%20%28aviation%29">inline engine</a> to score his first victory with his new unit. His men also saw that he would not only look out for his rookie pilots, but would not shirk the dangers of ground attack sorties. His offhand attitude toward two leg wounds he received during a strafing mission on 14 April, after which he made "a perfect landing", especially impressed his subordinates, as did his appreciation of all ranks for their hard work. His studious bent continued to serve him; he kept notes on his methods of attacking enemy aircraft, which often exploited their structural weaknesses, and used them to tutor pilots under his command.
Dallas was briefly hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14 April, but sneaked out four days later to rejoin his squadron. His departure may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend <a href="Richard%20Minifie">Richard Minifie</a>. As soon as he was able, Dallas was flying again. By 26 April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No. 40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." On 2 May, during a lull in the fighting at <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to "attract attention" before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Trenchard">Sir Hugh Trenchard</a>, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.

Dallas was raised to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and appointed to the command of a <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a>, but would never see the message from headquarters that arrived on 1 June 1918 advising him of the promotion and ordering him to cease flying. He disappeared on a solo mission the same day. It was later learned that he had been killed over <a href="Li%C3%A9vin">Liévin</a> during combat with three <a href="Fokker%20Dr.I">Fokker Triplanes</a> from "<a href="Jagdstaffel%2014">Jagdstaffel 14</a>", probably by its commander, "Leutnant" Johannes Werner. There are several theories as to how he died. The common elements are that he was on patrol near the front line when he pounced on a German plane flying at a lower level, that there might have been another unknown British pilot in trouble, and that the Germans who shot Dallas down had dived from a still higher altitude. Medics near his crash site at Absalom Trench ventured into <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> and retrieved his body, while a patrol of eight volunteers salvaged his personal effects from the fallen aircraft. News of Dallas's death was greeted with shock and disbelief by his squadron, one pilot recording:
The British magazine "Aeroplane" later paid tribute to him in an editorial:
For his record in aerial combat and his leadership skills, Dallas has been compared to the "Red Baron", <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>. The former flew combat for 29 months, and the latter for 31 months, if his three months in hospital are deducted. Dallas successfully led two different squadrons during his career, and was killed just before assuming command of a wing. Richthofen led first a squadron, then a wing during his 12 months in command, again excluding hospital time; he achieved more victories, but had the tactical advantage of fighting over his own lines with the wind in his favour. Dallas flew a score of different types of Allied aircraft, as well as captured German planes; he was also instrumental in developing the Sopwith Triplane. Richthofen flew the Fokker Dr.1, and helped develop the <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a>, but did not live to fly it into battle.

Stan Dallas was buried at the Pernes British Cemetery, France, in Lot 38, Row E of Plot II. Along with his military decorations, he was honoured with a Gold Medal by the <a href="A%C3%A9ro-Club%20de%20France">Aéro-Club de France</a>, and a Bronze Medal and Diploma by the <a href="Aero%20Club%20of%20America">Aero Club of America</a>. The town of <a href="Toogoolawah">Toogoolawah</a>, Queensland, commemorated him in the name of its airport, and the national capital of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> remembered him with Dallas Place. His home town of Mount Morgan has dedicated a water reservoir in his honour; its Historical Society Museum holds his medals, uniform, and sword, as well the propeller from one of his planes.

Historians have struggled to develop a definitive list of Dallas's victories; Adrian Hellwig, in the bibliography to his 2006 biography, lists over a dozen previous historians that have investigated the subject. He also refers to his difficulties in reconciling previous accounts. While various claim-by-claim analyses ascribe Dallas a score of 32 aircraft shot down, he was officially credited with 39, and with being second only to <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert Little</a>—who was credited with 47—among Australian aces. However, Dallas's unofficial tally has been estimated at over 50. This list is a compilation of claim-by-claim analyses that follow, as much as possible, the British system of confirming victory: pilot log entries and/or combat reports did not count, unless verified by squadron or higher levels of command. Thus, inclusion of a confirmed victory in this list has depended on verification by the Squadron Record Book, and/or by RNAS/RAF Communique or other reliable secondary source verification. Victories not confirmed by these methods are marked "u/c".

Edwin Taylor Pollock

Edwin Taylor Pollock (October 25, 1870June 4, 1943) was a career <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, serving in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He was later promoted to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a>. Like many naval officers, his name was often abbreviated using initials: Pollock.

As a young <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a>, Pollock served aboard during the Spanish–American War. After the war, he rose through the ranks, served on several ships, and did important research into wireless communication. In 1917, less than a week before the United States entered World War I, he won a race against a fellow officer to receive the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> from Denmark, and served as the territory's first acting governor. During the war, he was promoted to captain and a vessel under his command transported 60,000 American soldiers to France, for which he was awarded a <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>. Afterward, he was made the eighth Naval Governor of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a> and then the superintendent of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a>, before retiring in 1927.

Originally from <a href="Mount%20Gilead%2C%20Ohio">Mount Gilead, Ohio</a>, Pollock attended the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> and, as a midshipman, was assigned to and . He graduated with a rank of <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> in 1893.

After graduation, Pollock returned to Ohio and married Beatrice E. Law Hale on December 5. Two weeks later, he was assigned to the cruiser during its initial shake-down. He was subsequently assigned to the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> for an expedition to <a href="China">China</a>. He remained in China for two and a half years as part of the <a href="Asiatic%20Squadron">Asiatic Squadron</a>, then transferring to before returning home in 1897. On his return home, the Spanish–American War was heating up and he was reassigned to the "New York", to see service in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, eventually taking part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Battle of Santiago de Cuba</a>.

In January 1900, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> and assigned to . Over the following year he served on and . On board the "Buffalo", he returned to the Asiatic Squadron near China and was finally transferred to , the squadron's <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. He remained on board the "Brooklyn", until its return home in May 1902. After a brief leave, Pollock was assigned to the <a href="USS%20Severn%20%281898%29">USS "Chesapeake"</a> (as the <a href="Watchstanding">watch</a> and <a href="division%20officer">division officer</a>), a position he held for more than one year. He was transferred to , serving for another year, and then to <a href="Cavite%20Naval%20Base">Cavite Naval Base</a>. At Cavite, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> in February 1906.

His first duty as a lieutenant commander was on , as the <a href="navigator">navigator</a>. In 1910, Pollock was reassigned to , where he was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> in March 1911.

On his promotion, Pollock commanded and , before being transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a>. During his command of the "Kearsarge", Pollock briefly commanded for a world-record setting wireless experiment. For this feat, the "Salem" was outfitted with 16 different wireless telegraph technologies and sailed to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, with Pollock commanding. On arrival, they tested these technologies and set a world-record for longest wireless telegraph distance, , using a "Poulsen Apparatus", based on principles by <a href="Valdemar%20Poulsen">Valdemar Poulsen</a>. Experiments were also conducted to determine wireless characteristics during inclement weather and during both the day and night. In 1916, he was put in command of , the ship on which he had been the navigator.

In the final days before the entrance of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> into <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the US military was concerned that <a href="Germany">Germany</a> was planning to purchase or seize the <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a> for use as a <a href="submarine">submarine</a> or <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> base. At the time, <a href="Charlotte%20Amalie%2C%20United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">Charlotte Amalie</a> on <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas</a> was considered the best port in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> outside of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and <a href="Coral%20Bay%2C%20United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">Coral Bay</a> on <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint John</a> was considered the safest harbor in the area. Although the United States was not yet at war with Germany, the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. <a href="United%20States%20President">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> nominated <a href="James%20Harrison%20Oliver">James Harrison Oliver</a> to be the first military governor. The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>.

Oliver was unable to travel immediately to the Islands and the honor of being the first Acting Governor of the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a> was decided in an unusual way. Both Pollock, commanding , and B. B. Blerer's were dispatched to the Islands in a race. The commander of the ship that arrived first would officiate at the transfer ceremony and be acting governor. Pollock arrived first and the transfer ceremony took place on March 31, 1917, on Saint Thomas. Blerer officiated at a smaller ceremony on <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>. Present for the handover was the crew of the Danish station cruiser <a href="Valkyrien%20%281888%29">"Valkyrien"</a> and the former island legislature. The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, less than a week after securing the islands. Oliver was confirmed by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> on April 20 and relieved Pollock as governor.

During the war, Pollock was appointed as captain on , a German cruise liner which was seized by the United States government for use as a military transport ship. She was rechristened "George Washington" in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1, 1917. That December, she set out with her first load of troops. During the war, Pollock successfully transported 60,000 American soldiers to <a href="France">France</a> in 18 round trips. In 1918, the "George Washington" was tasked to deliver <a href="United%20States%20President">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a>, though Pollock would not make the trip. He was reassigned on September 29, 1918.

While on board the "George Washington", Pollock and <a href="Chaplain">Chaplain</a> Paul F. Bloomhardt edited a daily <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a>. After the war, stories from the paper were assembled and published in 1919 by J. J. Little & Ives co. as "Hatchet of the United States Ship "George Washington"". A short review of the work by "<a href="The%20Outlook%20%28New%20York%29">Outlook</a>" magazine called the book "readable" and "admirably illustrated". It "abounds in clever bits of fun, queer and notable incidents, and sound and patriotic editorials."
After the war, he was eventually reassigned to the battleship , to serve in the Pacific fleet. On November 10, 1920, Pollock was awarded a <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> for his services during the war.

On November 30, 1921, Pollock was transferred from command of the "Oklahoma" to become the Military Governor of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>. Events both personal and political had led to a previous governor, <a href="Warren%20Terhune">Warren Terhune</a>'s, <a href="suicide">suicide</a> on November 3, 1920, and the appointment of Governor <a href="Waldo%20A.%20Evans">Waldo A. Evans</a> to conduct a court of inquiry into the situation and to restore order. Pollock succeeded Evans, who had successfully restored the government and productivity of the islands after a period of unrest. At this time, American Samoa was administered by a team of twelve officers and a governor, with a total population of approximately 8,000 people. The islands were primarily important due to the excellent <a href="harbor">harbor</a> at <a href="Pago%20Pago">Pago Pago</a>.

Beginning in 1920, a <a href="Mau%20movement">Mau movement</a>, from the <a href="Samoan%20language">Samoan</a> word for "opposition", was forming in American Samoa in protest of several Naval government policies, some of which had been implemented by Terhune but which were not revoked following his death, which natives (and some non-natives) found heavy-handed. The movement itself may have been inspired by a different and older Mau movement in nearby <a href="Western%20Samoa">Western Samoa</a>, against the <a href="Germany">German</a> and then <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> <a href="colonialism">colonial</a> powers. Some of the initial grievances of the movement included the quality of roads in the territory, a marriage law which largely forbade natives from marrying non-natives, and a justice system which discriminated against locals in part because laws were not often available in Samoan. In addition, the United States Navy also prohibited an assembly of Samoan chiefs, whom the movement considered the real government of the territory. Surprisingly, the movement had grown to include several prominent officers of former Governor Terhune's staff, including his <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>. It culminated in a proclamation by <a href="Samuel%20S.%20Ripley">Samuel S. Ripley</a>, an <a href="Samoans">American Samoan</a> from an "afakasi" or mixed-blood Samoan family, with large communal property in the islands, that he was the leader of a legitimate successor government to pre-1899 Samoa. Evans also met with the high chiefs and secured their assent to continued Naval government. Ripley, who had traveled to Washington to meet with <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Edwin%20C.%20Denby">Edwin C. Denby</a>, was not permitted by Evans to enter the port at American Samoa and returned to <a href="exile">exile</a> in California, where he later became the mayor of <a href="Richmond%2C%20California">Richmond</a>.

After being appointed as governor, Pollock's continued the colonization work started by his predecessor. Prior to traveling to the territory, he met with Ripley in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco, California</a>. Although Ripley maintained that American "occupation" of Samoa was usurpation, he agreed to allow Pollock to govern unfettered and to provide him with copies of his letters. Almost immediately after arriving on the island, Pollock and Secretary of Native Affairs S. D. Hall met with representatives of the Mau, becoming the first governor to do so. Shortly afterwards, some members of the Mau disbanded, though the movement would continue in some form for another 13 years.

Pollock's remaining time as governor was less eventful. While exploring <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> in May 1923, he discovered a turtle which had been branded by <a href="Captain%20Cook">Captain Cook</a> on his expedition there in 1773. The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years. He was ordered home on July 26, 1923.

Immediately on leaving Samoa, Pollock was appointed superintendent of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, replacing outgoing <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> William D. MacDougal.

On August 22, 1924, <a href="Mars">Mars</a> came within of Earth. The US Naval Observatory made no formal observations of the planet, but Pollock and the son of astronomer <a href="Asaph%20Hall">Asaph Hall</a> ceremonially re-enacted Hall's 1877 discoveries of the moons <a href="Phobos%20%28moon%29">Phobos</a> and <a href="Deimos%20%28moon%29">Deimos</a> with his original <a href="telescope">telescope</a>. They also made observations to calculate the masses of the two moons.

On January 24, 1925, Pollock commanded the <a href="dirigible">dirigible</a> on a flight from <a href="Lakehurst%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lakehurst, New Jersey</a>, to photograph a <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a> from an altitude of . This was the first time an eclipse had been photographed from the air.

Pollock retired from service in 1927 and was replaced as superintendent by Captain Charles F. Freeman. In 1930, Pollock and his wife purchased a summer home in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Jamestown, Rhode Island</a>, while continuing to maintain their main residence in Washington, D.C. In 1932, he was made a director of the Jamestown Historical Society. He also became interested in genealogy and published several works on his family's history through the 1930s. He died on June 4, 1943, after a long illness and was buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> on June 7, 1943.

Goodbyeee

"Goodbyeee", or "Plan F: Goodbyeee", is the sixth and final episode of "<a href="Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Blackadder Goes Forth</a>", the fourth series of British historical <a href="television%20comedy">sitcom</a> "<a href="Blackadder">Blackadder</a>". The episode was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC1</a> in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>. Apart from the one-off short film "" made a decade later, it was the last episode of "Blackadder" to be produced and transmitted.

The episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and <a href="Captain%20Blackadder">Captain Blackadder</a>'s attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince <a href="General%20Melchett">General Melchett</a>, and <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Field Marshal Haig</a>'s advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. "Goodbyeee" has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in <a href="Machine%20gun">machine-gun</a> fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of <a href="gallows%20humour">gallows humour</a>, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves.

<a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a> and <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a> wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going "over the top", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant.

Each series of "Blackadder" depicts its protagonist, always a scheming and (except in the <a href="The%20Black%20Adder">first series</a>) witty man named <a href="Edmund%20Blackadder">Edmund Blackadder</a>, in different periods throughout history. In "Blackadder Goes Forth", he is <a href="Captain%20Blackadder">Captain Blackadder</a> (<a href="Rowan%20Atkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a>), an officer in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> on the Western Front during the First World War.

Joined by his colleagues—the <a href="Poverty">poor</a>, stupid and unhygienic <a href="Baldrick%23Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Private Baldrick</a> (<a href="Tony%20Robinson">Tony Robinson</a>), and the overly optimistic, <a href="Upper%20class">upper-class</a> and equally idiotic <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29">Lieutenant George St Barleigh</a> (<a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a>)—Blackadder tries constantly to escape his position and avoid the "big push", which he fears will result in his death. His efforts are hindered by the loud and intimidating <a href="General%20Melchett">General Melchett</a> (<a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>) and Melchett's strict, <a href="Sardonicism">sardonic</a>, and <a href="jobsworth">jobsworth</a> <a href="staff%20officer">staff officer</a>, <a href="Darling%20%28Blackadder%29">Captain Darling</a> (<a href="Tim%20McInnerny">Tim McInnerny</a>).

Captain Blackadder's trench receives a phone call from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to <a href="Desertion">escape</a> by <a href="Feigned%20madness">pretending to be mad</a>: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.

Melchett leaves after George declines his offer not to participate in the push, and Baldrick suggests that Blackadder ask Field Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a> to get them out; remembering that Haig owes him a favour, Blackadder decides to call in the morning. George, Baldrick and Blackadder discuss the War and the friends they have lost—George mentions the <a href="Christmas%20truce">Christmas truce</a> of 1914 (in which the belligerents stopped fighting to play <a href="association%20football">football</a>) and realises he is the only "<a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity</a> <a href="Tiddlywinks">Tiddlers</a>" member still alive; this is paralleled in Baldrick's pets, who have all died. Back at HQ, Melchett surprises Captain Darling with a front-line <a href="Commissioned%20officer">commission</a>. Darling's pleas to reconsider are misinterpreted, and Melchett insists that he go.

The following morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and reminds him of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling states that he had hoped to live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée.

The men are called to the trench to prepare for the big push. There is a moment of hope when the British <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29">barrage</a> lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, but for the first time in any series, does not call it a "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign insanity because "who would have noticed another madman round here?" The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous <a href="Machine%20gun">machine-gun</a> fire. The sequence enters <a href="slow%20motion">slow motion</a> as a slow piano version of the <a href="Blackadder%23Theme%20tune">"Blackadder" theme</a> is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> fades into a tranquil field of <a href="Poppy%20%28flower%29">poppies</a>, with only birdsong to be heard.

The episode was written by <a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a> and <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a>, who swapped <a href="Floppy%20disk">computer disks</a> to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of "Blackadder Goes Forth" during <a href="read-through">read-through</a>s. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains <a href="Causes%20of%20World%20War%20I">how the First World War started</a>; the <a href="running%20gag">running gag</a> of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.

The episode's title is a reference to the popular First World War song "<a href="Good-bye-ee%21">Good-bye-ee!</a>", which was based on a catchphrase of the comedian <a href="Harry%20Tate">Harry Tate</a>. The song is also heard in an earlier episode — "<a href="Major%20Star">Major Star</a>". The title is a departure from those of previous "Blackadder Goes Forth" episodes, which are <a href="pun">pun</a>s on military ranks.

During the filming of the episode, which took place before a <a href="studio%20audience">studio audience</a> at <a href="BBC%20Television%20Centre">BBC Television Centre</a>, Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a "knot in the pit of my stomach", something that he had never experienced. Hugh Laurie said that filming was sad because "even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people". Regarding guest star <a href="Geoffrey%20Palmer%20%28actor%29">Geoffrey Palmer</a>, the producer <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28producer%29">John Lloyd</a> said "[We] probably could have given [him] more attention", calling him "a wonderful actor" who is "really just delivering three or four plot lines [pieces of dialogue essential to the <a href="Plot%20%28narrative%29">plot</a>]".

The slow motion and fade effects at the end of the episode were not scripted, but the decision to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a> set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director <a href="Richard%20Boden">Richard Boden</a> added the poppy field image. The piano version of the theme tune was performed by <a href="Howard%20Goodall">Howard Goodall</a> and recorded in a <a href="gym">gym</a>nasium, giving it what Lloyd described as a "liquid, lonely sound". The episode's <a href="Closing%20credits">end credits</a> were omitted. Tim McInnerny did not know about these changes before the episode aired, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional.

In the episode, Field Marshal Haig is shown casually sweeping away <a href="toy%20soldiers">toy soldiers</a> with a <a href="dustpan">dustpan</a> and brush; "BBC News Magazine"s Finlo Rohrer called this a "visual allusion to his callousness", but quoted the historian <a href="Gary%20Sheffield%20%28historian%29">Gary Sheffield</a> as saying "The real Field Marshal Haig was certainly not a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did you ended up with lots and lots of casualties." Sheffield also noted that "Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and <a href="John%20French%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ypres">John French</a> and the other generals", so Haig effectively "appears twice". The series, and the storyline of "Goodbyeee" especially, often depicts the "<a href="lions%20led%20by%20donkeys">lions led by donkeys</a>" perception of the War, an element of "Blackadder Goes Forth" that has been criticised by historians.

In his book "The Great War", Ian F. W. Beckett also cited Sheffield: the latter commented that "Blackadder Goes Forth" was successful because "the characters and situations needed no explanation, so familiar was the audience with the received version of the war". Beckett noted the popularity of the episode's final scene, and compared it to a similarly popular one from "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>". He said that this comparison demonstrates the historian <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a>'s observation that the Second World War has been regarded as a "good war" in comparison to the first; he opined that "television producers ... have much to answer for in the perpetuation of the image of the Great War as one in which a generation of 'lions' were needlessly sacrificed by the 'donkeys'".

The producer John Lloyd cited the episode's lack of another major character as the reason they had time to "explore the relationships of the five principal people". Rowan Atkinson said that the scene involving Darling's "ghastly realisation" of his commission was "very sad"; Lloyd commented "I love the fact that Captain Darling does have some compassion; he's not just a <a href="bureaucrat">bureaucrat</a>". They noted that "all the comedy just goes away" upon Darling's arrival in the trench, and that "there are still funny moments, but dramatically there's no comic content, it's just leading inexorably to the end."

Comparing the ending scene to those of previous series of "Blackadder" in which the main characters were also killed, the writer Richard Curtis commented that "I think it was by chance that [previous series] ended with Blackadder being killed ... but series four, we did do it very much on purpose." He said that he and Elton felt they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering "if we did do that ... it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War".

Following its original broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC1</a> at 9:30 pm on Thursday, 2 November 1989, the episode was praised for its powerful and memorable ending. One journalist called the scene "a classy ending to a TV classic" and the "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" said that it was "brave" and "properly responsible" of the writers to end the series poignantly, especially when the episode aired close to <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a>.

The episode has also been the subject of more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" listed the final scene among six "perfect <a href="Series%20finale">end-of-show finales</a>", saying of "Blackadder": "It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds", and praising the writers and producer John Lloyd for "deliver[ing] a perfectly pitched, poignant ending". Comparing "Blackadder Goes Forth" to the 2012 war serial "<a href="Birdsong%20%28TV%20serial%29">Birdsong</a>", Alison Graham of the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" commented that "Nothing ... evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an overwhelming sense of loss as [its characters] going over the top to their certain death". Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of "top 10 TV show endings", calling it "one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of war that has ever been put on film". Reviewing the episode for <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>, Kate Kulzick described it as "...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it’s one of the best series finales in television history". She particularly praised it for "...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection", concluding that "...there is no such thing as a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close". The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the "Blackadder" series, which she considered "an important British dramatic treatment" of the War. Of the final episode Luckhurst wrote:
"Goodbyeee" went a good deal further than any other sitcom or comedy, by terminally sending pretty much the entire cast over the top in 1917, into a silence that has ... endured ever since. Many millions of viewers were shocked, and almost all taken aback by the abrupt realization of tragedy amid much-loved national television and after riotous laughter to that sudden and bitter end ...

In a poll conducted by <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" to determine television's one hundred most memorable moments, the final scene of "Goodbyeee" came ninth; it was one of only two entries in the top ten that was not news coverage (the other being a scene from "<a href="Only%20Fools%20and%20Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a>"). The "Radio Times" in 2001 asked a panel of comedians, writers and producers to pick their "50 favourite sitcom moments"; "Goodbyeee" was the only "Blackadder" episode included, and was ranked eleventh. The <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a> called the episode's ending "unexpectedly moving", and noted that, unusually for a comedy programme, it was repeated as part of a serious commemoration of Armistice Day: for its 80th anniversary in 1998. The series' overview from the website of <a href="UKTV">UKTV</a>'s channel <a href="Gold%20%28UK%20TV%20channel%29">Gold</a>, which airs repeats of "Blackadder", calls the final episode "a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy", and "a fitting end to an iconic series". In his segment advocating for "Blackadder" to be voted "<a href="Britain%27s%20Best%20Sitcom">Britain's Best Sitcom</a>", the broadcaster and journalist <a href="John%20Sergeant%20%28journalist%29">John Sergeant</a> called the final sequence "the one sitcom moment with claims to immortality".

Some historians of the First World War have taken a different view. William Philpott referred to the series, by name, as "<a href="wikt%3Abathetic">bathetic</a>" and felt it part of a "post-facto generalisation of the nature of their war" that "sucked in" even veterans of the conflict. In other words, the First World War soldier had become a "victim" in the public consciousness, a circumstance at odds with the historical record. The impact of Blackadder on the public consciousness was so pervasive that <a href="Gordon%20Corrigan">Gordon Corrigan</a> referenced it in his book cover copy when he published his book "Mud, Blood, and Poppycock", which was an attempt to "dispel various myths" about the war.

70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)

The 70th Infantry Division was an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> that fought during the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. What would become the 70th Division originated with the <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Infantry Division</a>, which was formed in 1938 to serve in the <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> during the <a href="1936%E2%80%9339%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">Arab Revolt</a>. This division then transferred to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> on the outbreak of the Second World War and soon became the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Infantry Division</a>, which went on to take part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> and the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>. On 10 October 1941, the 6th Division was re-created as the 70th Infantry Division, in an attempt to deceive <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> intelligence concerning the strength of British forces in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>.

The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> transported the division to <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> from 19 September to 25 October, in a politically controversial move to relieve the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">mainly Australian</a> garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven months, since the beginning of the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, the division defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> positions. On 18 November, the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Eighth Army</a> launched <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a>. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following the destruction of the Axis armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21 November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of the Axis tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26 November saw the division link up with the approaching <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">New Zealand Division</a>, cutting the Axis <a href="line%20of%20communication">lines of communication</a>. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to throw back the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; the Axis forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men—from units attached to the division—were awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for their actions during Operation Crusader.

Following the fighting at Tobruk, the division was withdrawn from the front and placed in reserve. When <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Japan entered the war</a>, the division was transferred to <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> landings while it trained in <a href="jungle%20warfare">jungle warfare</a>. It also served as a police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress <a href="civil%20disobedience">civil disobedience</a> caused by the <a href="Quit%20India%20Movement">Quit India Movement</a>. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line in <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma</a>, it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the <a href="Chindits">Chindits</a>. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24 November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">William Slim</a> (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.

In 1936, the <a href="1936%E2%80%9339%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">Arab Revolt</a> broke out in the <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a>. British troops were dispatched, ending the first phase of the war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With <a href="Causes%20of%20World%20War%20II">rising tensions in Europe</a>, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a>—on 30 September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.

The <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Infantry Division</a> was formed the following month and placed under the command of <a href="Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major-General</a> <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a>. The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region. This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the <a href="Old%20City%20%28Jerusalem%29">Old City</a> of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. O'Connor's men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19 October. The same day, the division seized <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> and by the end of the month were clearing <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> of rebels. Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area. In the north, the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">8th Infantry Division</a>, under Major-General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, and <a href="Special%20Night%20Squads">Special Night Squads</a> engaged in counter-terror operations, with O'Connor writing that one <a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">brigadier</a> "always encouraged his men to be brutal". <a href="General%20officer%20commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Palestine%20Command">British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan</a> <a href="Robert%20Haining">Robert Haining</a> wrote in late 1938 that "unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [and] killing in cold blood" had to be curbed. O'Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote "harshness and unnecessary violence on the part of our soldiers" had to be curbed. During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed. In early 1939, the revolt finally came to an end.

On 1 September 1939, the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> began with the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Invasion of Poland</a>, and two days later the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> declared war on Germany. On 31 August, the headquarters of the 7th Infantry Division gave up command of its troops. O'Connor and the divisional staff then left Jerusalem bound for <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>. From Cairo, the men moved forward to <a href="Mersa%20Matruh">Mersa Matruh</a> arriving on 7 September. The headquarters was then assigned all troops based there, with the exception of the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured Division</a>. The British <a href="History%20of%20the%20Second%20World%20War">Official Historian</a>, <a href="I.%20S.%20O.%20Playfair">I. S. O. Playfair</a>, comments that this decision was undertaken to relieve the burden on <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a>, GOC <a href="Egypt%20Command">British Troops Egypt</a>, of "direct control of operations which had been his in addition to the command of all troops in Egypt". Due to the logistical problems in maintaining substantial forces across the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Western Desert</a> and on the <a href="Libya">Libya</a>–Egypt border, Mersa Matruh was the forward British base of operations and supplied by rail. Positioned west of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and from the border, the location had been chosen to shield forward <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) landing strips behind it and to defend the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>. Mersa Matruh also offered the British the strategy of drawing <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> or other forces forward to them, to allow a counter-attack after they ran into supply difficulties.

On 3 November, the division was renamed the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Infantry Division</a>. The division initially commanded rear area personnel and the <a href="22nd%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">22nd Infantry Brigade</a>. Over the coming months, the <a href="14th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">14th</a> and <a href="16th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">16th Infantry Brigade</a>s were assigned to the division as they arrived in Egypt from Palestine. On 10 June 1940, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> declared war upon Britain and her <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">allies</a>. Seven days later, the 6th Infantry Division was dissolved and its headquarters transformed into the command staff of a <a href="corps">corps</a> known as the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Force">Western Desert Force</a> (WDF). In early September 1940, Italian forces based in Libya <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">invaded Egypt</a>. Three months later, the WDF began a limited raid, <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a>. The raid succeeded and was expanded; in two months the WDF advanced , occupied the Italian province of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> and destroyed the <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28Italy%29">Italian 10th Army</a>. The operation was halted in February 1941 to give priority to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>.

On 17 February 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was reformed in Egypt. It was initially made up of the 16th and the <a href="22nd%20Guards%20Brigade">22nd Guards Brigade</a>, who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">23rd Infantry Brigade</a>. Here, the division trained for amphibious operations in the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a>. The deteriorating situation in North Africa, which saw <a href="General%20der%20Panzertruppe">General</a> <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>'s "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" retake the territory lost by the Italians during Operation Compass, resulted in the 6th Infantry Division being reassigned to defend Egypt. The division had been earmarked to deploy to <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, where the 14th Brigade had been based since November, but instead took up defensive positions at Mersa Matruh. The 14th Brigade later defended the airfield at <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> when 2,000 <a href="Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger">German paratroopers</a> landed in the area on 20 May. The Germans were able to penetrate into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions. Due to the deteriorating situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships on 29 May. En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the "Luftwaffe", suffering 800 casualties.

By late April, British attention had shifted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> due to the <a href="Anglo-Iraqi%20War">Anglo-Iraqi War</a>, although the situation was resolved by the end of May. A greater concern was that <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German</a> and <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italian</a> forces had intervened in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Iraq">Iraq</a>, using bases in <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy</a> <a href="French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon">Syria</a>. With Germans and Italians threatening to gain full control of the French territory, thus jeopardising the British position in the Middle East, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> invaded Syria (<a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Operation Exporter</a>) on 8 June. In the face of stiff resistance from the Vichy French, the British realised that reinforcements were needed. On 13 June, the 6th Infantry Division (with two infantry brigades) was ordered to reinforce the effort. The leading elements of the 16th Infantry Brigade arrived on 17 June and captured <a href="Kuneitra">Kuneitra</a>. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived on 28 June. The division then took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Damascus%20%281941%29">Battle of Damascus</a>. The campaign ended on 14 July and the division remained in Syria.

<a href="Operation%20Sonnenblume">Operation Sonnenblume</a>, the counter-attack launched by Italian troops and the "Afrika Korps" across Cyrenaica, had forced the British and Commonwealth forces into retreat during March and April. Richard O'Connor—now General Officer Commanding British Troops Egypt—had been captured. The <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 9th Infantry Division</a> fell back to the fortress port of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> and the remaining British and Commonwealth forces withdrew a further east to <a href="Sallum">Sollum</a> on the Libyan–Egyptian border.

These moves initiated the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>. Although isolated by land, the garrison was supplied by the Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port. This failure was significant; Erwin Rommel's front line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies regained the initiative.

Australian policy for the use of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (2AIF) was to have all forces concentrated in an <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a>, under Australian command. By June, Australian troops were dispersed throughout the Middle East, <a href="British%20Cyprus%20%281914%E2%80%931960%29">Cyprus</a> and North Africa. The subject had been of concern to the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian Government</a> since 18 April. The issue came to a head on 18 July, when <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a> (commander of the 2AIF, and deputy commander <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>) wrote a letter to General <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a>, the new commander of all forces in North Africa and the Middle East, stating "the agreed policy for the employment of Australian troops between the British and Australian Governments is that the ... troops should operate as a single force." Blamey also highlighted that the troops in Tobruk were showing a decline in health due to the siege and that the attrition rate they were suffering would result in "considerable" casualties, if they were not replaced by fresh troops. This caused a diplomatic row between <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and the Australian Government that continued after the war, and turned what <a href="Graham%20Freudenberg">Graham Freudenberg</a> called a "reasonable request in July" into "a risky one in October".

The relief of the garrison and replacement with fresh troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the <a href="Polish%20Independent%20Carpathian%20Rifle%20Brigade">1st Polish Carpathian Brigade</a> replace the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Australian Infantry Brigade</a>. Next came the 6th Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Brigade, during late September, with elements of the <a href="32nd%20Army%20Tank%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">32nd Army Tank Brigade</a>, in lieu of the <a href="24th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">24th Australian Infantry Brigade</a>. On 10 October, for security reasons and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as to when the division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division. Major-General <a href="Ronald%20Scobie">Ronald Scobie</a> was given command.

The final stage of the relief effort took place between 12 and 25 October. The remaining elements of the 70th Division were transported into Tobruk and the remaining Australian garrison (save the <a href="2/13th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/13th Battalion</a> and elements of the <a href="2/15th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/15th Battalion</a>) were shipped out. In total, the relief effort evacuated 47,280 men (including prisoners) and brought in 34,113 men; it also brought the garrison's armour strength to 126 tanks. On 22 October, the 32nd Army Tank Brigade was attached to the 70th Division. With the relief effort over, command of the garrison was given to Scobie. Investing Tobruk were some German infantry and the Italian <a href="27th%20Infantry%20Division%20Brescia">27th Infantry Division "Brescia"</a>, <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20Bologna">25th Infantry Division "Bologna"</a>, <a href="17th%20Infantry%20Division%20Pavia">17th Infantry Division "Pavia"</a>, and <a href="102nd%20Motorised%20Division%20Trento">102nd Motorised Division "Trento"</a>.

Prior to their withdrawal, the Australians briefed the incoming British troops. The men of the division then took over from the Australians and settled into their task of defending Tobruk, with what the <a href="Black%20Watch">Black Watch Regiment</a> described as a sense that it was "the main post of honour open to the British fighting man." The soldiers' lives were uncomfortable: fresh water was scarce, washing was a luxury and done in sea-water, razor blades were in short supply, meals were basic and <a href="Dust%20storm">sand storms</a> were common. The troops were engaged in a dull routine: daily artillery bombardments by both sides, Axis air raids every night on Tobruk harbour, and for the infantry, nightly patrols. These patrols, described by the Black Watch as "pure 1914–18 warfare", varied from reconnaissance missions—to identify what was located at a certain position—to capturing enemy soldiers and <a href="Trench%20raiding">large scale trench raids</a> on enemy positions. Auchinleck and Rommel had planned offensive operations simultaneously. The latter sought to capture Tobruk, aiming to launch an assault during the period of 20 November – 4 December, whereas Auchinleck planned to relieve Tobruk with a slightly earlier start date.

Auchinleck planned for <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a> (under Lieutenant-General <a href="Willoughby%20Norrie%2C%201st%20Baron%20Norrie">Willoughby Norrie</a>), containing the British armour, to advance around the undefended southern Axis flank, south of Sidi Omar, before moving towards Tobruk and engaging the German and Italian armoured units in battle. Once the Axis armour was defeated, the British force would attack towards Tobruk aiming to capture Sidi Rezegh, while the garrison broke out aiming to capture Ed Duda, cutting the enemy <a href="Line%20of%20communication">lines of communication</a>. On 18 November, the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a> began the offensive. Rommel, believing the attack was an attempt to hinder his own plans to assault Tobruk, did little to counter the British offensive. This led to the capture of Sidi Rezegh and the suggestion that the 70th Division should begin its attack on 21 November, before the Axis armour had been defeated. The plan to break out of Tobruk had been well rehearsed; the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%20York%20and%20Lancaster%20Regiment">2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment</a>, 2nd Black Watch, 2nd <a href="King%27s%20Own%20Royal%20Regiment%20%28Lancaster%29">King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)</a> and 2nd <a href="Queen%27s%20Royal%20Regiment%20%28West%20Surrey%29">Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)</a> would lead the attack with tanks of the 32nd Army Tank Brigade in close support.

Under cover of dark the men moved forward, creating gaps in the barbed wire and minefields in front of their positions and bridging Tobruk's <a href="Anti-tank%20trench">anti-tank ditch</a>. At 06:30, on 21 November, the division began its attack on the positions of the "Bologna" Division and the German <a href="90th%20Light%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">90th Light Division</a> (although the latter had not been expected). The Axis positions were well dug-in, behind mines and barbed wire, supported by machine guns and artillery. The first position, codenamed "Butch", was captured by 09:00, shortly followed by "Jill", but two attempts to capture "Tugun" were repulsed by the Italian defenders. The mix of Italian and German troops holding "Tiger" offered up the most resistance of the day. The supporting <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda tanks</a> ran into undetected minefields and were engaged periodically by Axis anti-tank guns. The Black Watch, under flanking fire from other Axis strong points and being fired upon directly by the defenders of "Tiger", led a bayonet charge to the sound of bagpipes and captured the position, in conjunction with elements of the <a href="1st%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">1st Royal Tank Regiment</a> (1 RTR) and the <a href="4th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">4th Royal Tank Regiment</a> (4 RTR). The Black Watch suffered 75 per cent casualties, being reduced to 165 men.

Despite the losses, the Black Watch launched another attack to capture "Jack". Major Meythaler, the commanding officer of the German sector under attack, was positioned there and reported nine more British tanks lost to mines. Minutes after his report, at 10:30, the Black Watch overran the strong point. 1 RTR proceeded to overwhelm "Wolf", but were repulsed by anti-tank fire when they attempted to attack "Freddie". During the afternoon, a further attack was launched that captured half of "Tugun", but further progress was impeded by Italian artillery fire. The planned final thrust, to seize Ed Duda, was called off, due to the changing situation to the south. By the end of the day, a <a href="Salient%20%28territory%29">salient</a> deep and wide had been created, 550 German and 527 Italian soldiers had been captured, and 59 tanks of the 32nd Army Tank Brigade had been lost, of which half were repaired. The war diary of the German 90th Light Division described the day's actions as "very serious" concluding "that the next day 'would probably bring a crisis.

The following day the division improved its position. Strong point "Lion", to the south west of "Tiger", was captured, but an attempt to capture the remaining sections of "Tugun" was repelled. As a result of the fighting, the division began to face a shortage of ammunition for its artillery. Due to the tank battle raging to the south, Scobie was ordered not to make a further advance. The author of the "<a href="Official%20History%20of%20New%20Zealand%20in%20the%20Second%20World%20War%201939%E2%80%9345">Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45</a>", W. E. Murphy, said the fighting by the British armour and 70th Division created much "confusion in the enemy camp" and that, had the 32nd Army Tank Brigade attempted, it "could certainly have got to Ed Duda" and in doing so would have thwarted the German plans, greatly aiding the beleaguered 7th Armoured Division.

To the south, having temporarily defeated the British armour, Rommel launched the "Afrika Korps" and the Italian mobile divisions towards Egypt in the "Dash to <a href="Frontier%20Wire%20%28Libya%29">the Wire</a>". He sought to relieve the besieged Italian garrisons along the border, cut the British supply lines and inflict an overwhelming defeat upon the Eighth Army. Despite causing panic amongst rear echelon troops, the attack was weak and ran into difficulties against prepared positions. The <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a> had advanced around the Italian border defences and on 24 November began an advance towards Tobruk. By the next day, the division had reached Zaafran and retaken the much-contested Sidi Rezegh airfield.

From these positions, the New Zealanders were ordered to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed break-out offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General <a href="Alfred%20Reade%20Godwin-Austen">Alfred Godwin-Austen</a>, the <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a> commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was under no obligation to attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other objectives were repulsed.

Aware that Ed Duda was still in Axis hands and that the New Zealand Division had bogged down attempting to advance upon the feature and was caught up in heavy fighting, Scobie ordered his men to capture Ed Duda. The 1st <a href="Essex%20Regiment">Essex Regiment</a>, with machine gun support from the <a href="Royal%20Northumberland%20Fusiliers">Royal Northumberland Fusiliers</a> and the 32nd Army Tank Brigade, began their attack just after midday on 26 November. Axis artillery fire damaged two tanks before they crossed the start line but the remaining was covered without incident. The 4 RTR were able to silence several Axis gun positions, and were joined by Z Company of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, who helped eliminate a further position. Following the fighting, the Essex were ordered to join the tanks.

The 1st Essex now advanced on Ed Duda, which was not a fortified position as previously faced by the division. An artillery bombardment and the approaching British troops persuaded the defending Italian platoon to surrender. By 15:00, Ed Duda was in British hands and the Essex began digging in to consolidate their position. Following the capture of the position, several Axis counterattacks were launched. Three German tanks inflicted heavy casualties upon a British detachment in front of the main Essex position, before being driven off. Two infantry companies advanced towards the Essex and "were badly shot up in their lorries at a range of some 200 yards." In following engagements, the Essex took upwards of 110 prisoners. By the end of the day, the position was secure for the loss of only 65 casualties. That evening, the New Zealanders renewed their attacks and succeeded in linking with the 70th Division and cutting the Axis lines of communication.

On 27 November, Rommel abandoned his attack and ordered the "Afrika Korps" and accompanying Italians to return to the Tobruk area. It was not until 29 November that the Axis armour launched its attack upon the 70th and New Zealand divisions. Around 50 tanks of the <a href="15th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">15th Panzer Division</a> advanced on the 1st Essex and were engaged by anti-tank guns and a handful of British <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>s. Several British tanks were hit and the rest retired. The anti-tank guns of the Essex were silenced, and 300 German soldiers from II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 115 advanced. Two companies of the Essex were overrun, with 150 men captured. As darkness fell, British and German tanks again clashed before the former withdrew. Under the cover of night, the Australian 2/13th Battalion was ordered to counter-attack along with the remnants of 4 RTR (eleven tanks in total). Elements of the Essex battalion spontaneously joined the assault, retaking the lost ground and capturing 167 prisoners for the loss of around 25 men. Less than 60 German troops were able to retreat to friendly units.

Axis attention now concentrated upon the New Zealand Division; after the recent fighting, the division, less 4,500 men who joined the 70th Division, withdrew towards the frontier in need of rest, refitting and re-organization; the 70th Division was again cut off. On 1 December, Godwin-Austen was concerned about the exposed British position at Ed Duda, as were the staff of 70th Division, who believed the area had become untenable. Infantry had reinforced the captured ground, the 14th Infantry Brigade holding a line from Ed Duda to roughly to the north-east. The Essex were still dug in at Ed Duda, with the <a href="19th%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">19th New Zealand Battalion</a> to their north-east, then the 4th <a href="Border%20Regiment">Border Regiment</a>, the <a href="18th%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">18th New Zealand Battalion</a> to their east and the 1st <a href="Bedfordshire%20and%20Hertfordshire%20Regiment">Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment</a> to their north at Bir (Magen) Belhamed and the captured Axis strong point known as "Leopard". The commanding officer of the 1st Essex reported that the position was well prepared and he was confident of repelling any assault. Scobie sent word stating "Well done, I admire your spirit".

For several days, the 70th Division was bombarded, and on 1 December an uncoordinated attack by the German 90th Division was repulsed by the 18th New Zealand Battalion. The following day, a larger attack was launched upon the 1st Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment. This attack was also repulsed inflicting heavy losses on one of the German battalions. On 4 December, elements of the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division</a>, supported by an ad hoc formation of 500 German infantry and Italian engineers and artillery support from the 90th Light Division, launched an assault on Ed Duda. This attack was met by the Essex, 4th Borders, 18th New Zealanders and elements of the 32nd Army Tank Brigade. The German attack was defeated and the 4th Borders, supported by tanks, counter-attacked taking of ground, for the loss of fifteen tanks.

The 70th Division had been planning another attack to capture El Adem but the battle made these plans redundant. The inability of the Germans and Italians to defeat the 70th Division and push the unit back inside Tobruk had strategic consequences. Rommel had come to the conclusion that his troops could not maintain the siege due to being overstretched, and decided to withdraw all of the troops he could to the east of Tobruk. The 70th Division initially joined other Eighth Army formations in advancing west in pursuit, but by 12 December it had returned to Tobruk. Over the course of December, Operation Crusader continued and the Axis forces retreated to <a href="El%20Agheila">El Agheila</a> before fighting ceased. The 70th Division was withdrawn to Egypt for rest and refitting. Due to a lack of transport, the move took until mid-January. By the end of the month, the division had returned to Syria to camp near Damascus.

During the night of 7/8 December 1941, one hour prior to the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> entered the war with the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Malaya">Japanese invasion of Malaya</a>. Four hours following the strike on Pearl Harbor, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Battle of Hong Kong</a> was launched; the city surrendered on Christmas Day. On 15 January 1942, the Japanese attack was expanded as their troops <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">invaded Burma</a>. Then, on 15 February, <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">Singapore fell</a>. During February, the 70th Division began moving back to Egypt. On 17 February the order was given for the division to be transferred to <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>. The next day, Major-General <a href="George%20William%20Symes">George Symes</a> was given command of the division. They boarded ships at <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, and had completely departed Egypt by 28 February. The division, without the 16th Brigade, reached Bombay on 10 March. With a Japanese invasion of <a href="British%20Ceylon">British Ceylon</a> expected, the 16th Brigade was sent in as reinforcements, arriving on 15 March. It remained until 1943, when it rejoined the division. In June 1942, the 70th Division was located near <a href="Ranchi">Ranchi</a>; along with the <a href="50th%20Indian%20Tank%20Brigade">50th Indian Armoured Brigade</a>, it formed part of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eastern Army</a> reserve. The division was seen as a well-trained formation and along with the <a href="23rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29">23rd Indian Infantry Division</a> formed a mobile reserve against a Japanese landing or advance through <a href="Rakhine%20State">Arakan</a> in <a href="British%20rule%20in%20Burma">Burma</a>. At Ranchi, the division also engaged in <a href="jungle%20warfare">jungle warfare</a> training.

In August 1942, <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s <a href="Quit%20India%20Movement">Quit India Movement</a> resulted in <a href="civil%20disobedience">civil disobedience</a> spreading across <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, <a href="Orissa%2C%20India">Orissa</a> and <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. The division was deployed throughout these areas, suppressing the disturbances and protecting the railways of Bihar. After civil power was restored in the affected areas, the 70th Division was concentrated again at Ranchi and resumed training as part of <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28British%20India%29">XV Indian Corps</a>. The corps commander, Lieutenant-General <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">William Slim</a>, wrote in his memoirs that the 70th Division "was one of the best British formations I have met, with a magnificent battle hardened spirit gained in the Middle East".

A member of the division, writing in May 1943, commented that it would not be

In April 1943, Slim requested that the 70th Division be released from Eastern Army reserve to relieve other units on the Arakan front, but elements of the division were only slowly redeployed. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived in the Arakan area in May. As of June, the remainder of the division was still part of the army reserve.

On 14 February 1943, Brigadier <a href="Orde%20Wingate">Orde Wingate</a> launched <a href="Operation%20Longcloth">Operation Longcloth</a>. This operation saw the <a href="77th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">77th Indian Infantry Brigade</a> operate behind the Japanese lines, supplied via air drops, ambushing Japanese troops and destroying rail lines. The force returned to Allied lines during April, having lost nearly a third of its troops; most of the remainder, as described by historian Christopher Chant, were "crippled by exhaustion, malnutrition, dysentery, and malaria." Despite this, the operation was deemed a success. In August 1943, Wingate (now a major-general) was sent to attend the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a>. Churchill and the Americans were so impressed by Wingate that Special Force, commonly known as the <a href="Chindits">Chindits</a>, were ordered to be expanded. Under this expansion, the 70th Division would be broken up and its units transferred to Special Force.

Auchinleck, now <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20India">Commander-in-Chief, India</a>, strongly opposed such a move preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived <a href="81st%20%28West%20Africa%29%20Division">81st (West Africa) Division</a> could be used in its place. Despite his arguments and the end of the division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied <a href="Ramree%20Island">Ramree Island</a>, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6 September, the division began reorganising for <a href="long-range%20penetration">long-range penetration</a>. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.

On 25 October, the division was broken up and all troops were transferred to Special Force. Symes, despite his seniority, became Wingate's second-in-command and tried to prevent the further break-up of the divisional units to retain the traditions, histories and "<a href="Morale">esprit de corps</a>" of the British Army's <a href="Structure%20of%20the%20British%20Army">regimental structure</a>, which reconciled his men and helped to ensure a smooth transition to Special Force. Having ceased to exist, the 70th Division was officially disbanded on 24 November.

The British Official Historian, <a href="Stanley%20Kirby">Stanley Kirby</a>, wrote that the best-trained and most-experienced British division had been broken up to reinforce Special Force, which eventually absorbed one-sixth of the infantry in <a href="South%20East%20Asia%20Command">South East Asia Command</a>. He judged that had the division been retained, it could have reinforced the Fourteenth Army, making the defence of <a href="Battle%20of%20Imphal">Imphal</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kohima">Kohima</a> in 1944 easier. Historian F. W. Perry wrote, "it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the results achieved by the force did not represent an adequate return for the resources invested". He further argued that the force was too lightly armed to capture strongly held positions or to hold one if captured, and concluded that Special Force "inflicted more damage and disruption on the British Army than it ever did on the Japanese." Similarly, Slim argued in his memoirs that it had been a mistake to break up the 70th Division as it was the only British division which had been trained in jungle warfare, and that it would have been twice as effective as an experienced conventional formation than it proved to be as part of Special Force.

El Hatillo Municipality

El Hatillo Municipality () is an <a href="administrative%20division">administrative division</a> of the <a href="Miranda%20State">State of Miranda</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>; along with <a href="Baruta%20Municipality">Baruta</a>, <a href="Chacao%20Municipality">Chacao</a>, <a href="Libertador%20Municipality%20%28Venezuelan%20Capital%20District%29">Libertador</a> and <a href="Sucre%20Municipality%2C%20Miranda">Sucre</a>, it is one of the five <a href="municipality">municipalities</a> of <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a>, the <a href="Capital%20%28political%29">capital</a> of Venezuela. It is located in the southeastern area of Caracas, and in the northwestern part of the State of Miranda.

The <a href="County%20seat">seat</a> of the <a href="municipal%20government">municipal government</a> is <a href="El%20Hatillo%20Town%2C%20Miranda">El Hatillo Town</a>, founded in 1784 by <a href="Don%20Baltasar%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Don Baltasar de León</a>, who was instrumental in the area's development. Although the town had its origins during the <a href="Spanish%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonisation</a>, the municipality was not established until 1991. In 2000 – the year after a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Venezuela">constitution</a> was enacted in Venezuela – some of the municipality functions were delegated to a consolidated mayor's office called "Alcaldía Mayor", which also has some authority over the other four municipalities of Caracas.

El Hatillo preserves some of its <a href="colonial%20architecture">colonial architecture</a>, including an 18th-century <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> and a unique <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Romanian Orthodox Church</a>. The municipality also has a rich artistic culture, with at least two important musical festivals celebrated yearly, and numerous holiday celebrations reflecting the heritage of El Hatillo. The culture, the pleasant temperature, the rural landscape, and the <a href="gastronomy">gastronomy</a> of the municipality have made it a place of interest for <a href="tourism">visitors</a> to the city, and a desirable place to live. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism, an activity that is promoted by the government.

Although commercial areas are growing rapidly, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> remains a foundation of the economy in the <a href="rural">rural</a> areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector remains mostly underdeveloped, causing heavy <a href="employee">employee</a> movement in and out of the municipality – a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested.

In the 16th century, when the <a href="Spanish%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonisation</a> in the area began, El Hatillo was inhabited by the <a href="Mariches">Mariches</a>, an <a href="Indigenous%20people%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous people</a> possibly related to the <a href="Kalina%20people">Kalina</a> (Caribs). Cacique <a href="Tamanaco">Tamanaco</a> was the leader of these tribes, known for <a href="Resistance%20movement">resisting</a> the Spanish colonisation. As the colonisation developed, the indigenous inhabitants were killed; by order of Caracas's founder <a href="Diego%20de%20Losada">Diego de Losada</a>, Tamanaco was also murdered.
In 1752, <a href="Don%20Baltasar%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Don Baltasar de León García</a> arrived to El Hatillo from <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, Spain, having just completed a prison term at "La Carraca", Spain, for opposing (with his father) the monopoly rules of <a href="Guipuzcoana%20Company">Guipuzcoana Company</a>, which was in charge of maintaining exclusive trade between Spain and Venezuela. Don Baltasar founded El Hatillo Town, becoming one of the most significant contributors to its early development. Don Baltasar focused on making El Hatillo a strong, united and independent community, aiming to establish the area as a distinct <a href="Parish%20%28subnational%20entity%29">parish</a> from Baruta, on which El Hatillo depended. He accomplished this on June 12, 1784, when the governor and the <a href="bishop">bishop</a> agreed to declare El Hatillo autonomous and under the direction of Don Baltasar, in front of 180 <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary</a>-descendant families; this date is accepted as the foundation date of El Hatillo Town.

That same year, Don Baltasar and his <a href="brother-in-law">brother-in-law</a> donated their properties to the town, and an engineer assisted in the urban planning, which included <a href="Grid%20plan">grid streets</a> and a <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a>. The church was built to honor <a href="Santa%20Rosalia">Santa Rosalía de Palermo</a>, who Baltasar believed had saved him from a plague that killed his father in prison. In 1803, at the age of 79, Don Baltasar was unexpectedly killed in a horse accident.

In 1809, <a href="landlord">landlord</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Manuel Escalona achieved the separation of El Hatillo from <a href="Petare">Petare</a>, another suburb of Caracas, making it a different "Tenientazgo de Justicia" – a type of administrative division at the time. On April 19, 1810, Escalona enjoined the town to the movement of independence under <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a>, becoming another important person in the history of the municipality.

Ana Francisca Pérez García, Don Baltasar's wife, was a noteworthy woman in El Hatillo, attending to community children, elders and ill citizens. She donated a considerable amount of money for the construction of a hospital in Petare after the <a href="1812%20Caracas%20earthquake">1812 earthquake</a>; this hospital is currently known as the Pérez de León de Petare Hospital.
One of the most ambitious urbanisation projects in El Hatillo since its founding was the neighborhood called La Lagunita. In the 1950s and 1960s, La Lagunita S.A. constructed a "functional, futuristic and comfortable" residential zone. To encourage people to settle in the area, each <a href="land%20lot">parcel</a> included a membership to Lagunita Country Club, which was officially opened in 1964. <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian <a href="landscape%20designer">landscape designer</a> <a href="Roberto%20Burle%20Marx">Roberto Burle Marx</a> contributed to this project, constructed on the 4.3 million m² <a href="hacienda">hacienda</a> that once belonged to former Venezuelan <a href="President%20of%20Venezuela">president</a>, <a href="Eleazar%20L%C3%B3pez%20Contreras">Eleazar López Contreras</a>. La Lagunita has since become a wealthy neighborhood of El Hatillo.

Although El Hatillo has been independent from Petare since 1809, it later became part of Sucre Municipality, where Petare is located. On November 19, 1991, Miranda's Legislative Assembly gave El Hatillo full autonomy, making it an independent municipality; this decision was issued in "Gaceta Oficial" on January 17, 1992. In 1993, Mercedes Hernández de Silva was elected the first <a href="mayor">mayor</a> of El Hatillo. Since 2000, the "Alcaldía Mayor" manages some of the functions of the municipality.

 El Hatillo Municipality lies at the southeast area of the city of Caracas and at the northwest corner of the State of Miranda; it is one of the state's 21 municipalities. El Hatillo is also within the jurisdiction of the "Alcaldía Mayor", which has power over three adjacent municipalities of Miranda, and over <a href="Libertador%20Municipality%20%28Venezuelan%20Capital%20District%29">Libertador Municipality</a> in the <a href="Venezuelan%20Capital%20District">Capital District</a>. These five municipalities make up the city of Caracas. El Hatillo has a land size of – the third largest municipality in the capital.

The municipality's natural southern boundary is the Turgua range, spanning east to west and separating El Hatillo from the Baruta and Paz Castillo municipalities. Parallel to Turgua in the north is the Sabaneta range; the Prepo stream runs between the two ranges. North of the Sabaneta range, the Prepo stream feeds into the Tusmare stream, which ends in the Guaire river.
La Guairita stream flows into the Guaire in northeastern El Hatillo. The Guaire river is the eastern limit of the municipality, separating it from Sucre and Paz Castillo in the southeastern sector of El Hatillo. La Guairita serves as the northern boundary between El Hatillo and the municipalities of Baruta and Sucre. Limiting Baruta to the west, the boundaries of the municipality follow <a href="Picacho%20de%20El%20Volc%C3%A1n">El Volcán</a>, Pariaguán, La Mata and other peaks until they meet Turgua range in southeastern El Hatillo.

The tallest <a href="mountain">peak</a> in El Hatillo is <a href="Picacho%20de%20El%20Volc%C3%A1n">Picacho de El Volcán</a> (Spanish for "Peak of the Volcano"), at 1,490 meters (4,888 ft) above sea level, from where radio, television and telecommunication antennas serve Caracas. Despite its name, the mountain has had no recorded volcanic history. Other significant mountains in El Hatillo are Gavilán at , Topo de El Paují at and Topo de Piedras Pintadas at .

El Hatillo, at a higher altitude than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75 °F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18 °C (64 °F) and the atmosphere may have constant <a href="fog">fog</a>. The mean <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> is 997.3 millimeters a year (39 inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500 millimeters (32 in to 59 in). The average <a href="humidity">humidity</a> index is 75%; similar to the rest of Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The winds are north alizé <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a>.

Concentrated near <a href="water%20bodies">water bodies</a>, the <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a> in most of El Hatillo is dense <a href="forest">forest</a>s, occupying around 30% of the surface. Smaller plants like <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s take around 9% and <a href="herb">herb</a>s occupy a similar percentage. In 1972, the forests of El Hatillo were declared a protected zone of the metropolitan area of Caracas.

The municipality is home to a wide range of <a href="bird">bird</a> <a href="species">species</a>, with more than two hundred registered, including <a href="American%20Kestrel">sparrowhawks</a>, <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s, and <a href="owl">owl</a>s. <a href="Birdwatching">Birdwatching</a> in the area is promoted by the authorities of Miranda, who have also supported conservation of these species.

 In the 16th century, the indigenous <a href="Mariches">Mariches</a> were killed by the explorers; when the development of El Hatillo began, <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> from the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> settled in the area. Families from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> also immigrated to El Hatillo, working largely in agriculture in La Unión neighborhood. As of 2001, 86% of the inhabitants of El Hatillo were born in Venezuela; the largest group not born in Venezuela was from <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> with 4.2% of the population, followed by Spain with 2.0%, Italy with 1.0%, the United States with 1.0%, and Portugal with 0.8%.

In the 2001 National Institute of Statistics <a href="census">census</a>, El Hatillo Municipality had 54,225 inhabitants, but demographics show a rapidly rising population. With the progressive demographic increase, El Hatillo's population is no longer exclusive to any particular ethnic group. In 2001 there were 997 births in El Hatillo, equivalent to a rate of 18.4 births per one thousand citizens. The death rate for that same year was 2.9 per one thousand citizens. 2001 data shows that there is an average of 21.3 <a href="years%20of%20potential%20life%20lost">years of potential life lost</a>. The main cause of death according to 1999 data was <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, followed by <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a> and <a href="murder">murder</a>.
Data for 2000 shows that the largest age group to be 15- to 19-year-olds, representing 9.5% of El Hatillo's population; for every 100 females there are 94.2 males. The <a href="unemployment">unemployment</a> rate in 2001 was 6.1%, ranking fourth lowest among the twenty-one municipalities in Miranda.

As of 2001, there were 18,878 homes in El Hatillo, of which 13,545 were occupied; the remaining homes were either unoccupied, occasionally used, under construction, or for sale. An average of four people made up each household. Regarding <a href="wealth">wealth</a>, 74.7% of the population were above poverty level, 21.5% were <a href="Poverty">poor</a>, and 3.8% were <a href="extreme%20poverty">extremely poor</a>. According to the 2001 census, each <a href="household">household</a> in the municipality received an average of 1,316,906 <a href="Venezuelan%20bol%C3%ADvar">Venezuelan bolívar</a>es (1316.906 bolívares fuertes) per month, equal to <a href="US%24">US$</a>1,832 at the time, or US$21,984 per year.

Although there are no defined limits for the <a href="neighborhood">neighborhood</a>s of El Hatillo, the government website divides the municipality into <a href="urban%20area">urban</a> and <a href="rural">rural</a>. Concentrated in the northern region of the municipality, the urban neighborhoods are El Hatillo Town, El Calvario, La Lagunita, Alto Hatillo, La Boyera, Las Marías, Oripoto, Los Pomelos, Los Naranjos, Los Geranios, La Cabaña, Cerro Verde, Llano Verde, Colinas, Vista El Valle, Los Olivos, and El Cigarral. The rural localities of the municipality are located in southern El Hatillo; these are La Unión, Corralito, Turgua, La Hoyadita, Sabaneta, La Mata, Caicaguana, and Altos de Halcón.

The economy of El Hatillo Municipality consists of three sectors: the <a href="Commerce">commercial</a> sector, which has been growing along with the population increase and is primarily represented by shopping malls and retail stores around the urban areas most of which sell typical crafts of the country; <a href="agricultural">agricultural</a>, in the southern half of the municipality and existing since the founding of El Hatillo; and <a href="tourism">tourism</a>, which contributes significantly to El Hatillo's income and is promoted by the government.

El Hatillo is an accessible day visit destination for people from Caracas; the municipality is only southeast of downtown Caracas but in the mountains removed from the congested Caracas valley; thus, development has focused on day tourism. The central town square – Plaza Bolívar – and its surroundings are well maintained, and the municipal government offers bus trips around the narrow streets for viewing the colonial architecture of the town. Handcrafted <a href="souvenir">souvenir</a>s and products are popular purchases, offered at local artisan shops, and there are numerous restaurants. There are at least three cultural centers in the municipality that attract tourists and residents to music festivals and art expositions.

To support the increasing population, numerous <a href="shopping%20malls">shopping malls</a> have been built in the municipality. Neighborhoods like La Lagunita, Los Naranjos and El Hatillo Town now offer large scale shopping malls with multiplex <a href="movie%20theaters">movie theaters</a>. Since the 1980s, the older typical houses of El Hatillo Town have been converted to shops and restaurants, while preserving their colonial architecture.

Employment possibilities within El Hatillo – a <a href="Commuter%20town">bedroom community</a> of Caracas – are reduced; businesses in the municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted from a lack of land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.

Venezuelan law specifies that municipal governments have four main functions: executive, legislative, comptroller, and planning. The executive function is managed by the <a href="mayor">mayor</a>, who is in charge of representing the municipality's administration. The legislative branch is represented by the Municipal Council, composed of seven <a href="councillors">councillors</a>, charged with the deliberation of new decrees and local laws. The comptroller tasks are managed by the municipal <a href="comptroller">comptroller</a>'s office, which oversees <a href="accountancy">accountancy</a>. Finally, planning is represented by the Local Public Planning Council, which manages development projects for the municipality.

El Hatillo has had five mayors through 2014. Mercedes Hernández de Silva was the first mayor of the municipality, serving from 1993 until 1996. Succeeding her, Flora Aranguen was Mayor from 1996 until 2000. That same year, <a href="Alfredo%20Catal%C3%A1n">Alfredo Catalán</a> was elected mayor and reelected in 2004. On November 23, 2008 Myriam Do Nascimento was elected mayor. She served in that capacity until 2013, when David Smolansky succeeded her as mayor.

The 2007 president of the Municipal Council is Leandro Pereira, supported by the <a href="political%20party">political party</a> <a href="Justice%20First">Justice First</a>. All but one of the seven councillors belong to political parties opposed to <a href="presidents%20of%20Venezuela">President</a> <a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a>'s administration. There is also a Legislative Commission, presided over by councillor Salvador Pirrone in 2007. The commission's job is to assist the municipality in legal matters, such as the creation of new laws and decrees.

On March 8, 2000 – the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela – it was <a href="decree">decree</a>d that the <a href="Metropolitan%20District%20of%20Caracas">Metropolitan District of Caracas</a> would be created, and that some of the powers of El Hatillo Municipality would be delegated to the "Alcaldía Mayor", which would also govern the Baruta, Libertador, Sucre and Chacao municipalities. Each of the five municipalities is divided into parishes; El Hatillo has only one, the Santa Rosalía de Palermo Parish, sometimes called Santa Rosalía de El Hatillo Parish or simply El Hatillo Parish.

In December 2006, as a part of a <a href="constitutional%20reform">constitutional reform</a>, Chávez proposed a reorganisation of the municipal powers. Chávez mentioned his reform plans again in his January 2007 presidential inauguration, suggesting a new form of subdivision—communal cities—in which mayors and municipalities would be replaced by communal powers.

Relative to the other Caracas municipalities, El Hatillo has the region's lowest crime rate. Data from 2003 shows that 53,555 crimes occurred within the five municipalities of Caracas, but only 418 (about 0.78%) took place within El Hatillo. El Hatillo's population is significantly lower than that of its sister municipalities; viewing 2003 crime data relative to 2001 census data, El Hatillo had an annual rate of 7.7 crimes for every one thousand citizens, while the average of the five Caracas municipalities was 19.4 for every one thousand citizens. The main <a href="police">police</a> force in El Hatillo is the municipal police, sometimes referred to as Poli-Hatillo. Other police forces can also intervene in the municipality, including the Metropolitan Police, and the Miranda State Police.

The municipality has one <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> facility – Nueva Esparta University, a 30,000 square meters (323,000 sq ft) institution located in Los Naranjos. Nueva Esparta school was founded in 1954, but the private university was not constructed until 1989.

El Hatillo offers free <a href="public%20education">public education</a>, with a total of seventeen <a href="primary%20education">primary education</a> <a href="schools">schools</a>; eleven are public and six are <a href="private%20education">private</a>. Nineteen <a href="preschool">preschool</a>s exist: ten public and nine private. Data for <a href="secondary%20education">secondary education</a> is incomplete; there are five private secondary schools in the municipality, but the number of public secondary schools is unavailable. Government data shows each educational stage separately, but an individual facility may contain preschool, primary and secondary education. The 2001 census shows enrollment of 8,525 students during the 2000–2001 <a href="school%20year">school year</a>; by the end of the school year, 8,149 had passed.

The most significant icon in the culture of El Hatillo is <a href="Santa%20Rosalia">Santa Rosalía de Palermo</a>. The church adjacent to the plaza in the center block of El Hatillo Town is named after this <a href="saint">saint</a>, and the only parish in the municipality also carries her name. The community is largely <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>; local shops carry many religious handcrafted products, and the municipality is the site of the <a href="Rose%20of%20Lima">Santa Rosa de Lima</a> <a href="Seminary">Seminary</a>, formerly San José Seminary. In El Hatillo – and throughout Venezuela – images of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Mary</a> are part of the art and culture.

Don Baltasar de León and his wife, Ana Francisca, are remembered for founding and developing El Hatillo. Manuel Escalona is recognised for including El Hatillo in the 19th century independence movement; as in the rest of Venezuela, <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a> is <a href="hero">considered</a> a <a href="Libertadores">hero</a>.

Santa Rosalía de Palermo – born in <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a>, Italy – is the <a href="patron">patron</a> <a href="saint">saint</a> of El Hatillo. Rosalía was recognised in 1624 when her remains were discovered in a cave, brought to the Cathedral of Palermo, and displayed through the streets of Palermo during a plague. Within three days, the plague ended; Rosalía was credited with saving many from the plague and proclaimed patron saint of the city.

Years later, El Hatillo's founder also believed that Santa Rosalía had protected him from an infection. During the Guipuzcoana scandal in Venezuela, Baltasar's father, Juan Francisco de León, and his sons were held prisoners in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>. Juan Francisco died as a consequence of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, but Don Baltasar completed his years in prison and then moved to El Hatillo. Baltasar brought the legacy of Santa Rosalía de Palermo to El Hatillo, believing she protected him from the <a href="infectious%20disease">pestilence</a> that killed his father in Cádiz.

Part of El Hatillo's culture has grown around Santa Rosalía; she is believed to be the one who takes care of the people and protects El Hatillo from any <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a> that could hit the area. Don Baltasar's most evident inclusion of Rosalía into El Hatillo's culture occurred at least twice: first in 1776, when El Calvario chapel was built and dedicated to the Saint; and then in 1784, when a bigger <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> named "Iglesia Santa Rosalía de Palermo" was constructed.

In addition to the nationwide activities celebrating <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, the <a href="New%20Year">New Year</a>, <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a>, and <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, El Hatillo has a number of celebrations unique to the region. Since the 1766 founding of El Hatillo, a week-long festival honoring Santa Rosalía de Palermo (Spanish: "Fiestas Patronales en honor a Santa Rosalía de Palermo") is held in September featuring parades, <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Catholic masses</a>, and traditional games, concluding with the traditional release of balloons accompanied by fireworks. On <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Holy Thursday</a>, an image of the crucified <a href="Christ">Christ</a> is decorated with flowers and paraded around El Hatillo's Plaza Bolívar in the <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="Procession">Procession</a>. Since 1938, Carnival has been celebrated in El Hatillo with dancing, parades, and the election of a Carnival Queen in Plaza Bolívar. The founding of El Hatillo is commemorated on June 12 with organised activities including traditional games, mass, and balloons. A tradition having religious and agricultural significance has been celebrated every May since the beginning of the twentieth century. The third Sunday of May is the festival of "Dama antañona", in which residents pay homage to the women of El Hatillo, with typical food and gifts.

The Cultural and Social Center El Hatillo, El Hatillo Art Center, and El Hatillo Atheneum are the local centers of artistic activity. In 2006, <a href="Dave%20Samuels">Dave Samuels</a> inaugurated the annual International Music Festival of El Hatillo at the El Hatillo Art Center; Samuels was followed by <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20D%C3%ADaz">Simón Díaz</a>, <a href="Steve%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Steve Smith</a>, <a href="Serenata%20Guayanesa">Serenata Guayanesa</a>, <a href="Mike%20Stern">Mike Stern</a> and other notable musicians. Since 1999, the El Hatillo Jazz Festival has attracted visitors to the municipality to hear national and foreign <a href="jazz">jazz</a> artists.

El Hatillo's art culture is rich with handcrafted products. <a href="Pottery">Pottery</a> is a common <a href="souvenir">souvenir</a> for tourists, and there are many artisans devoted to ceramics and pottery in the municipality. The Turgua Group is an <a href="artist%20collective">artist collective</a> of almost twenty potters and <a href="blacksmiths">blacksmiths</a>, founded in 1992 by Guillermo Cuellar, an internationally known potter. The group has two exhibitions a year, which have expanded from pottery exposition to <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>, <a href="photography">photography</a>, <a href="woodwork">woodwork</a>, <a href="drawing">drawing</a> and <a href="weaving">weaving</a>.

In May 2005, the local government collaborated with the Japanese Embassy to organise Japan Cultural Week, an exposition held in the Art Center featuring <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>, <a href="origami">origami</a>, <a href="kimonos">kimonos</a>, <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a>, <a href="anime">anime</a> and other manifestations of the <a href="Japanese%20culture">Japanese culture</a>. The event offered free workshops for learning these Japanese arts. Continuing cultural promotion in the municipality, the "III Salón de Fotografía El Hatillo" – a photography contest for children, <a href="amateur">amateur</a> and professional photographers – was organised in October 2005.

The cuisine industry in El Hatillo has grown along with the commercial development of the municipality. A September 2006 article in "Estampas" – a weekly Venezuelan <a href="magazine">magazine</a> – described the <a href="culinary%20art">culinary art</a>s of El Hatillo, noting that El Hatillo offers the usual Venezuelan table, as well as new gastronomic developments. The <a href="TV%20chef">TV chef</a> Yuraima Blanco opened the Culinary Art Gallery in El Hatillo, where diners can enjoy a variety of food. There are also typical <a href="cachapa">cachapa</a> restaurants and <a href="caf%C3%A9s">cafés</a>, as well as other restaurants with a fusion of foreign and national food. According to "Estampas", a well-known local restaurant called "Mauricio's" mixes <a href="Swiss%20food">Swiss</a> and <a href="French%20food">French food</a> with <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> gastronomy. El Hatillo also offers many varieties of <a href="confectionery">confectionery</a>, such as <a href="churros">churros</a>, <a href="pastry">pastry</a> and <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a>. There are a variety of other restaurants in El Hatillo, offering such diverse cuisine as German and <a href="Thailand">Thai</a> food.

Lagunita Country Club is one of the most important sports facilities in the municipality. The club offers tennis and swimming, but it is best known for its golf course, the home of the 1974 <a href="WGC-World%20Cup">WGC-World Cup</a>. Designed by <a href="Dick%20Wilson%20%28golf%20course%20architect%29">Dick Wilson</a>, the club began with temporary headquarters in 1959, opening officially in 1964. Lagunita Country Club played an important role in the development of La Lagunita neighborhood – an ambitious urban project, which has become one of the wealthiest areas of Caracas.

Hiparión is another club located in El Hatillo; according to the Venezuelan Census of Cultural Heritage, this <a href="equestrianism">equestrian</a> facility from the 1930s was originally used for horse trips, but it later became a place for the training and caring of horses. The Club Hiparión is internationally known for its equestrian training.

Located at the highest point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small mountain of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course is open to the public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.

The hub of activity in El Hatillo Town is Bolívar Plaza (Spanish: "Plaza Bolívar"), a garden square encompassing the central block in the town of El Hatillo. Constructed in 1785, the Plaza was originally called "Plaza Mayor" or "Plaza del Mercado". In 1911, a <a href="bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> honoring Manuel Escalona was placed in the square, which was renamed in his honor. In 1952, the bust was replaced with a statue of Simón Bolívar, and the plaza was again renamed after the Venezuelan hero. Across from the Bolívar Square is the 18th century Santa Rosalía de Palermo Church, which was declared a National Historic Monument in 1960.

Between El Hatillo and La Lagunita is the smaller Manuel Escalona Plaza (Spanish: "Plazoleta Manuel Escalona"), another urban monument displaying the bust of Escalona that formerly occupied Bolívar Square. Sucre Plaza (Spanish: "Plaza Sucre") – graced since 1915 with a <a href="ceiba">ceiba</a> tree at its center – is in the southern part of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners, and it is also known as "Plaza La Ceiba". The Four Corners (Spanish: "Las Cuatro Esquinas") was a convenient social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar.

La Lagunita is the site of the <a href="San%20Constantino%20and%20Santa%20Elena%20Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">San Constantino and Santa Elena Romanian Orthodox Church</a>. The building is an architectural work from the 16th century, brought from Romania, made completely from <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a> woods, and detailed with more than 40,000 individually placed and <a href="Stone%20carving">carved</a> tiles. It is one of only 15 churches of its type remaining in the world, and one of only two outside of Romania, the other being in Switzerland.

For children, the Caicaguana <a href="hacienda">hacienda</a> in La Lagunita houses the Expanzoo, where visitors can see and touch exotic animals. The zoo is recognised for offering unique employment opportunities; the workers are from families with few resources, and the staff include the <a href="mentally%20ill">mentally ill</a>. The Baby Zoo is another place for children to interact with animals; visitors can feed and touch the animals, ride horses and rent the location for special events. More interaction with nature can be experienced by visiting the Morro la Guairita park in El Cafetal – commonly known as the Indian Caves (Spanish: "Cuevas del Indio") – a system of 22 natural openings in the mountain, and the only place in Caracas where <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a> is permitted. Guided tours are available, and views of <a href="Cerro%20El%20%C3%81vila">El Ávila</a> can be enjoyed while ascending the park.

The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the <a href="Caracas%20Metro">Caracas Metro</a> to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road <a href="public%20transportation">public transportation</a>. An extension of the Metro – <a href="List%20of%20Caracas%20Metro%20stations%23Line%205%20%28Magenta%29">Line 5</a> – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of <a href="List%20of%20Caracas%20Metro%20stations%23Line%204%20%28Red%29">Line 4</a> is still under construction. <a href="Urban%20planning">Urban planning</a> in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south <a href="beltway">beltway</a> suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as <a href="US%24">US$</a>19,572,000.

Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the <a href="traffic%20congestion">traffic congestion</a> around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold. In five years, 250 thousand more cars are circulating in Caracas on roadways that have not increased proportionally to the increase in the number of cars. Further, public transportation is not fully reliable; an average trip in the city using mass transit takes around ninety minutes.

Parthian Empire

The Parthian Empire (; 247 BC – 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire (), was a major <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a> political and cultural power in <a href="ancient%20Iran">ancient Iran</a>. Its latter name comes from <a href="Arsaces%20I%20of%20Parthia">Arsaces I of Parthia</a> who, as leader of the <a href="Parni">Parni</a> tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a> in <a href="Iran">Iran</a>'s northeast, then a <a href="satrap">satrap</a>y (province) under <a href="Andragoras%20%28Seleucid%20satrap%29">Andragoras</a>, in rebellion against the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>. <a href="Mithridates%20I%20of%20Parthia">Mithridates I of Parthia</a> (r. c. 171–138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Media</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, in what is now central-eastern <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, to eastern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The empire, located on the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> trade route between the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a> and the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> of <a href="China">China</a>, became a center of trade and commerce.

The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed <a href="Culture%20of%20Iran">Persian</a>, <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a>, and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of <a href="Culture%20of%20Greece">Greek culture</a>, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of <a href="Religion%20and%20culture%20in%20ancient%20Iran">Iranian traditions</a>. The Arsacid rulers were titled the "<a href="King%20of%20Kings">King of Kings</a>", as a claim to be the heirs to the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>; indeed, they accepted many local kings as <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, <a href="satrap">satrap</a>s. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from <a href="Nisa%2C%20Turkmenistan">Nisa</a> to <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a> along the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> (south of modern <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>), although several other sites also served as capitals.

The earliest enemies of the Parthians were the <a href="Seleucid%E2%80%93Parthian%20wars">Seleucids</a> in the west and the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> in the east. However, as Parthia expanded westward, they came into conflict with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Kingdom of Armenia</a>, and eventually the late <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>. Rome and Parthia competed with each other to establish the <a href="List%20of%20Armenian%20kings">kings of Armenia</a> as their <a href="Client%20state">subordinate clients</a>. The Parthians soundly defeated <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a> in 53 BC, and in 40–39 BC, Parthian forces captured the whole of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> except <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> from <a href="Ancient%20Rome">the Romans</a>. However, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> led a <a href="Antony%27s%20Parthian%20War">counterattack</a> against Parthia, although his successes were generally achieved in his absence, under the leadership of his lieutenant <a href="Publius%20Ventidius%20Bassus">Ventidius</a>. Various Roman emperors or their appointed generals invaded Mesopotamia in the course of the ensuing <a href="Roman-Parthian%20Wars">Roman-Parthian Wars</a> of the next few centuries. The Romans captured the cities of <a href="Seleucia">Seleucia</a> and Ctesiphon on multiple occasions during these conflicts, but were never able to hold on to them. Frequent civil wars between Parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the Empire's stability than foreign invasion, and Parthian power evaporated when <a href="Ardashir%20I">Ardashir I</a>, ruler of <a href="Estakhr">Istakhr</a> in <a href="Persis">Persis</a>, revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, <a href="Artabanus%20V%20of%20Parthia">Artabanus V</a>, in 224 AD. Ardashir established the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a>, which ruled Iran and much of the Near East until the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a> of the 7th century AD, although the Arsacid dynasty lived on through the <a href="Arsacid%20Dynasty%20of%20Armenia">Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia</a>, the <a href="Arsacid%20dynasty%20of%20Iberia">Arsacid dynasty of Iberia</a>, and the <a href="Arsacid%20Dynasty%20of%20Caucasian%20Albania">Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania</a>; all eponymous branches of the Parthian Arsacids.

Native Parthian sources, written in <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian</a>, <a href="Koine%20Greek">Greek</a> and other languages, are scarce when compared to Sassanid and even earlier <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid</a> sources. Aside from scattered <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> tablets, fragmentary <a href="ostraca">ostraca</a>, rock inscriptions, <a href="drachma">drachma</a> coins, and the chance survival of some <a href="parchment">parchment</a> documents, much of Parthian history is only known through external sources. These include mainly <a href="Greek%20historiography">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman histories</a>, but also <a href="Chinese%20historiography">Chinese histories</a>, prompted by the Han Chinese <a href="Han-Xiongnu%20War">desire to form alliances against the Xiongnu</a>. <a href="Parthian%20art">Parthian art</a>work is viewed by historians as a valid source for understanding aspects of society and culture that are otherwise absent in textual sources.

Before <a href="Arsaces%20I%20of%20Parthia">Arsaces I of Parthia</a> founded the Arsacid Dynasty, he was chieftain of the <a href="Parni">Parni</a>, an ancient <a href="Central-Asia">Central-Asia</a>n tribe of <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian peoples</a> and one of several <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic tribes within the confederation of the <a href="Dahae">Dahae</a>. The Parni most likely spoke an <a href="eastern%20Iranian%20language">eastern Iranian language</a>, in contrast to the <a href="Western%20Iranian%20languages">northwestern Iranian language</a> spoken at the time in <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>. The latter was a northeastern province, first under the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid</a>, and then the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> empires. After conquering the region, the Parni adopted <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian</a> as the official court language, speaking it alongside <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a>, <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Akkadian%20language">Babylonian</a>, <a href="Sogdian%20language">Sogdian</a> and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer.

Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247 BC as the first year of the Arsacid era is uncertain. <a href="Adrian%20David%20Hugh%20Bivar">A.D.H. Bivar</a> concludes that this was the year the Seleucids lost control of Parthia to <a href="Andragoras%20%283rd%20century%20BC%29">Andragoras</a>, the appointed <a href="satrap">satrap</a> who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I "backdated his <a href="regnal%20year">regnal year</a>s" to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased. However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts that this was simply the year Arsaces was made chief of the Parni tribe. Homa Katouzian and Gene Ralph Garthwaite claim it was the year Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis and Maria Brosius state that Andragoras was not <a href="Parni%20conquest%20of%20Parthia">overthrown by the Arsacids</a> until 238 BC.

It is unclear who immediately succeeded Arsaces I. Bivar and Katouzian affirm that it was his brother <a href="Tiridates%20I%20of%20Parthia">Tiridates I of Parthia</a>, who in turn was succeeded by his son <a href="Arsaces%20II%20of%20Parthia">Arsaces II of Parthia</a> in 211 BC. Yet Curtis and Brosius state that Arsaces II was the immediate successor of Arsaces I, with Curtis claiming the succession took place in 211 BC, and Brosius in 217 BC. Bivar insists that 138 BC, the last regnal year of Mithridates I, is "the first precisely established regnal date of Parthian history." Due to these and other discrepancies, Bivar outlines <a href="List%20of%20Parthian%20kings">two distinct royal chronologies</a> accepted by historians. A fictitious claim was later made from the 2nd-century BC onwards by the Parthians, which represented them as descendants of the Achaemenid king of kings, <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II of Persia</a> ().
For a time, Arsaces consolidated his position in Parthia and <a href="Hyrcania">Hyrcania</a> by taking advantage of the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by <a href="Ptolemy%20III%20Euergetes">Ptolemy III Euergetes</a> ("r". 246–222 BC) of <a href="History%20of%20Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Egypt</a>. This conflict with Ptolemy, the <a href="Syrian%20Wars%23Third%20Syrian%20War%20%28246-241%20BC%29">Third Syrian War</a> (246–241 BC), also allowed <a href="Diodotus%20I">Diodotus I</a> to rebel and form the <a href="Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom">Greco-Bactrian Kingdom</a> in Central Asia. The latter's successor, <a href="Diodotus%20II">Diodotus II</a>, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of <a href="Seleucus%20II%20Callinicus">Seleucus II Callinicus</a> ("r". 246–225 BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic <a href="Apasiacae">Apasiacae</a> tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III the Great</a> ("r". 222–187 BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of <a href="Molon">Molon</a> in <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Media</a>.

Antiochus III launched a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209 BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II. The latter was granted the title of king (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>: "<a href="basileus">basileus</a>") in return for his submission to Antiochus III as his superior. The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> and the Seleucid <a href="Battle%20of%20Magnesia">defeat at Magnesia</a> in 190 BC. <a href="Phriapatius%20of%20Parthia">Phriapatius of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 191–176 BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and <a href="Phraates%20I%20of%20Parthia">Phraates I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 176–171 BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.

Phraates I is recorded as expanding Parthia's control past the <a href="Gates%20of%20Alexander">Gates of Alexander</a> and occupied <a href="Apamea%20Ragiana">Apamea Ragiana</a>. The locations of these are unknown. Yet the greatest expansion of Parthian power and territory took place during the reign of his brother and successor <a href="Mithridates%20I%20of%20Parthia">Mithridates I of Parthia</a> (r. c. 171–138 BC), whom Katouzian compares to <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> (d. 530 BC), founder of the Achaemenid Empire.

Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria deteriorated after the death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two <a href="Eparchy">eparchies</a> of the latter kingdom, then under <a href="Eucratides%20I">Eucratides I</a> ("r". c. 170–145 BC). Turning his sights on the Seleucid realm, Mithridates invaded Media and occupied <a href="Ecbatana">Ecbatana</a> in 148 or 147 BC; the region had been destabilized by a recent Seleucid suppression of a rebellion there led by <a href="Timarchus">Timarchus</a>. This victory was followed by the Parthian conquest of <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, where Mithridates had coins minted at <a href="Seleucia">Seleucia</a> in 141 BC and held an official <a href="investiture">investiture</a> ceremony. While Mithridates retired to Hyrcania, his forces subdued the kingdoms of <a href="Elymais">Elymais</a> and <a href="Characene">Characene</a> and occupied <a href="Susa">Susa</a>. By this time, Parthian authority extended as far east as the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a>.

Whereas <a href="Hecatompylos">Hecatompylos</a> had served as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates established royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a> and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert (<a href="Nisa%2C%20Turkmenistan">Nisa, Turkmenistan</a>), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty. Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of <a href="Gotarzes%20I%20of%20Parthia">Gotarzes I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 90–80 BC). It became the site of the royal <a href="coronation">coronation</a> ceremony and the representational city of the Arsacids, according to Brosius.

The Seleucids were unable to retaliate immediately as general <a href="Diodotus%20Tryphon">Diodotus Tryphon</a> led a rebellion at the capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in 142 BC. However, by 140 BC <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Nicator">Demetrius II Nicator</a> was able to launch a counter-invasion against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. Despite early successes, the Seleucids were defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces and taken to Hyrcania. There Mithridates treated his captive with great hospitality; he even married his daughter <a href="Rhodogune%20of%20Parthia">Rhodogune of Parthia</a> to Demetrius.
<a href="Antiochus%20VII%20Sidetes">Antiochus VII Sidetes</a> ("r". 138–129 BC), a brother of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife <a href="Cleopatra%20Thea">Cleopatra Thea</a>. After defeating Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130 BC to retake Mesopotamia, now under the rule of <a href="Phraates%20II%20of%20Parthia">Phraates II of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 138–128 BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the <a href="Great%20Zab">Great Zab</a>, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins. After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him to <a href="History%20of%20Syria">Syria</a>, but refused the other demands. By spring 129 BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting to put down the revolts, the main Parthian force swept into the region and killed Antiochus in battle. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' <a href="harem">harem</a>.
While the Parthians regained the territories lost in the west, another threat arose in the east. In 177–176 BC the nomadic confederation of the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> dislodged the nomadic <a href="Yuezhi">Yuezhi</a> from their homelands in what is now <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a> province in <a href="Northwest%20China">Northwest China</a>; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the <a href="Saka">Saka</a> (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were forced to move further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders. Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia.

Some of the Saka were enlisted in Phraates' forces against Antiochus. However, they arrived too late to engage in the conflict. When Phraates refused to pay their wages, the Saka revolted, which he tried to put down with the aid of former Seleucid soldiers, yet they too abandoned Phraates and joined sides with the Saka. Phraates II marched against this combined force, but he was killed in battle. The Roman historian <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a> reports that his successor <a href="Artabanus%20I%20of%20Parthia">Artabanus I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 128–124 BC) shared a similar fate fighting nomads in the east. He claims Artabanus was killed by the Tokhari (identified as the Yuezhi), although Bivar believes Justin conflated them with the Saka. <a href="Mithridates%20II%20of%20Parthia">Mithridates II of Parthia</a> (r. c. 124–90 BC) later recovered the lands lost to the Saka in <a href="Sistan">Sistan</a>.
Following the Seleucid withdrawal from Mesopotamia, the Parthian governor of Babylonia, Himerus, was ordered by the Arsacid court to conquer Characene, then ruled by <a href="Hyspaosines">Hyspaosines</a> from <a href="Charax%20Spasinu">Charax Spasinu</a>. When this failed, Hyspaosines invaded Babylonia in 127 BC and occupied Seleucia. Yet by 122 BC, Mithridates II forced Hyspaosines out of Babylonia and made the kings of Characene <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s under Parthian <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>. After Mithridates extended Parthian control further west, occupying <a href="Dura-Europos">Dura-Europos</a> in 113 BC, he became embroiled in a conflict with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Kingdom of Armenia</a>. His forces defeated and deposed <a href="Artavasdes%20I%20of%20Armenia">Artavasdes I of Armenia</a> in 97 BC, taking his son Tigranes hostage, who would later become <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II "the Great" of Armenia</a> ("r". c. 95–55 BC).

The <a href="Indo-Parthian%20Kingdom">Indo-Parthian Kingdom</a>, located in modern-day <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> made an alliance with the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC. Bivar claims that these two states considered each other political equals. After the Greek philosopher <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Tyana">Apollonius of Tyana</a> visited the court of <a href="Vardanes%20I%20of%20Parthia">Vardanes I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 40–47 AD) in 42 AD, Vardanes provided him with the protection of a caravan as he traveled to Indo-Parthia. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality.

Following the <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Imperial%20China">diplomatic venture</a> of <a href="Zhang%20Qian">Zhang Qian</a> into Central Asia during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Han">Emperor Wu of Han</a> ("r". 141–87 BC), the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Empire</a> of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121 BC. The Han embassy <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Han%20Dynasty%23Foreign%20trade%20and%20tributary%20exchange">opened official trade relations</a> with Parthia via the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the Xiongnu. The Parthian Empire was enriched by taxing the Eurasian caravan trade in <a href="History%20of%20silk">silk</a>, the most highly priced luxury good <a href="Roman%20commerce">imported by the Romans</a>. Pearls were also a highly valued import from China, while the Chinese purchased Parthian spices, perfumes, and fruits. Exotic animals were also given as gifts from the Arsacid to Han courts; in 87 AD <a href="Pacorus%20II%20of%20Parthia">Pacorus II of Parthia</a> sent lions and Persian gazelles to <a href="Emperor%20Zhang%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhang of Han</a> ("r". 75–88 AD). Besides silk, Parthian goods purchased by Roman merchants included <a href="History%20of%20metallurgy%20in%20the%20Indian%20subcontinent">iron from India</a>, <a href="Spice%20trade">spices</a>, and fine leather. Caravans traveling through the Parthian Empire brought West Asian and sometimes <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman luxury glasswares</a> to China. The merchants of <a href="Sogdia">Sogdia</a>, speaking an <a href="Sogdian%20language">Eastern Iranian language</a>, served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between Parthia and Han China.

The Yuezhi <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a> in northern India largely guaranteed the security of Parthia's eastern border. Thus, from the mid-1st century BC onwards, the Arsacid court focused on securing the western border, primarily against Rome. A year following Mithridates II's subjugation of Armenia, <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a>, the Roman <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, convened with the Parthian diplomat <a href="Orobazus">Orobazus</a> at the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> river. The two agreed that the river would serve as the border between Parthia and Rome, although several historians have argued that Sulla only had authority to communicate these terms back to Rome.

Despite this agreement, in 93 or 92 BC Parthia fought a war in Syria against the tribal leader <a href="Laodice%20of%20the%20Sameans">Laodice</a> and her Seleucid ally <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X Eusebes</a> ("r". 95–92? BC), killing the latter. When one of the last Seleucid monarchs, <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III Eucaerus</a>, attempted to besiege Beroea (modern <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>), Parthia sent military aid to the inhabitants and Demetrius was defeated.
Following the rule of Mithridates II, Gotarzes I ruled Babylonia, while <a href="Orodes%20I%20of%20Parthia">Orodes I</a> ("r". c. 90–80 BC) ruled Parthia separately. This system of split monarchy weakened Parthia, allowing Tigranes II of Armenia to annex Parthian territory in western Mesopotamia. This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of <a href="Sanatruces%20of%20Parthia">Sanatruces of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 78–71 BC).

Following the outbreak of the <a href="Third%20Mithridatic%20War">Third Mithridatic War</a>, <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a> ("r". 119–63 BC), an ally of Tigranes II of Armenia, requested aid from Parthia against Rome, but Sanatruces refused help. When the Roman commander <a href="Lucullus">Lucullus</a> marched against the Armenian capital <a href="Tigranocerta">Tigranocerta</a> in 69 BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes II requested the aid of <a href="Phraates%20III%20of%20Parthia">Phraates III of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 71–58). Phraates did not send aid to either, and after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tigranocerta">fall of Tigranocerta</a> he reaffirmed with Lucullus the Euphrates as the boundary between Parthia and Rome.

Tigranes the Younger, son of Tigranes II of Armenia, failed to usurp the Armenian throne from his father. He fled to Phraates III and convinced him to march against Armenia's new capital at <a href="Artashat%20%28ancient%20city%29">Artaxarta</a>. When this siege failed, Tigranes the Younger once again fled, this time to the Roman commander <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>. He promised Pompey that he would act as a guide through Armenia, but, when Tigranes II submitted to Rome as a <a href="Client%20state">client king</a>, Tigranes the Younger was brought to Rome as a hostage. Phraates demanded Pompey return Tigranes the Younger to him, but Pompey refused. In retaliation, Phraates launched an invasion into <a href="Corduene">Corduene</a> (southeastern Turkey) where, according to two conflicting Roman accounts, the Roman consul <a href="Lucius%20Afranius%20%28consul%29">Lucius Afranius</a> forced the Parthians out by either military or diplomatic means.
Phraates III was assassinated by his sons <a href="Orodes%20II%20of%20Parthia">Orodes II of Parthia</a> and <a href="Mithridates%20III%20of%20Parthia">Mithridates III of Parthia</a>, after which Orodes turned on Mithridates, forcing him to flee from Media to <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Syria</a>. <a href="Aulus%20Gabinius">Aulus Gabinius</a>, the Roman proconsul of Syria, marched in support of Mithridates to the Euphrates, but had to turn back to aid <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII Auletes</a> ("r". 80–58; 55–51 BC) against a rebellion in Egypt.

Despite losing his Roman support, Mithridates managed to conquer Babylonia, and minted coins at Seleucia until 54 BC. In that year, Orodes' general, known only as <a href="Surena">Surena</a> after his noble family's clan name, recaptured Seleucia, and Mithridates was executed.

<a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>, one of the <a href="First%20Triumvirate">triumvirs</a> who was now proconsul of Syria, launched an invasion into Parthia in 53 BC in belated support of Mithridates. As his army <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">marched to Carrhae</a> (modern <a href="Harran">Harran</a>, southeastern Turkey), Orodes II invaded Armenia, cutting off support from Rome's ally <a href="Artavasdes%20II%20of%20Armenia">Artavasdes II of Armenia</a> ("r". 53–34 BC). Orodes persuaded Artavasdes to a marriage alliance between the crown prince <a href="Pacorus%20I%20of%20Parthia">Pacorus I of Parthia</a> (d. 38 BC) and Artavasdes' sister.

Surena, with an army entirely on horseback, rode to meet Crassus. Surena's 1,000 <a href="cataphract">cataphract</a>s, armed with lances, and 9,000 <a href="horse%20archer">horse archer</a>s were outnumbered roughly four to one by Crassus' army, comprising seven <a href="Roman%20legion">Roman legion</a>s and auxiliaries including mounted <a href="Gauls">Gauls</a> and light infantry.

Relying on a baggage train of about 1,000 camels, the Parthian horse archers were given constant supplies of arrows. The horse archers employed the "<a href="Parthian%20shot">Parthian shot</a>" tactic, where they would fake a retreat, only to turn and fire upon their opponents. This tactic, combined with the use of heavy <a href="composite%20bow">composite bow</a>s on flat plain devastated Crassus' infantry.

With some 20,000 Romans dead, approximately 10,000 captured, and roughly another 10,000 escaping west, Crassus fled into the Armenian countryside. At the head of his army, Surena approached Crassus, offering a <a href="parley">parley</a>, which Crassus accepted. However, he was killed when one of his junior officers, suspecting a trap, attempted to stop him from riding into Surena's camp.

Crassus' defeat at Carrhae was one of the worst military defeats of Roman history. Parthia's victory cemented its reputation as a formidable if not equal power with Rome. With his camp followers, war captives, and precious Roman booty, Surena traveled some 700 km (430 mi) back to Seleucia where his victory was celebrated. However, fearing his ambitions even for the Arsacid throne, Orodes had Surena executed shortly thereafter.
Emboldened by the victory over Crassus, the Parthians attempted to capture Roman-held territories in <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>. <a href="Crown%20prince">Crown prince</a> Pacorus I and his commander Osaces raided Syria as far as Antioch in 51 BC, but were repulsed by <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Gaius Cassius Longinus</a>, who ambushed and killed Osaces. The Arsacids sided with Pompey in <a href="Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War">his civil war</a> against <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and even sent troops to support the anti-Caesarian forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a> in 42 BC. 

<a href="Quintus%20Labienus">Quintus Labienus</a>, a general loyal to Cassius and <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus%20the%20Younger">Brutus</a>, sided with Parthia against the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a> in 40 BC; the following year he invaded Syria alongside Pacorus I. The triumvir <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> was unable to lead the Roman defense against Parthia due to his departure to Italy, where he amassed his forces to confront his rival <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a> and eventually conducted negotiations with him at Brundisium.

After Syria was occupied by Pacorus' army, Labienus split from the main Parthian force to invade <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> while Pacorus and his commander <a href="Barzapharnes">Barzapharnes</a> invaded the Roman <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. They subdued all settlements along the Mediterranean coast as far south as Ptolemais (modern <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre, Israel</a>), with the lone exception of <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a>.

In <a href="Judea">Judea</a>, the pro-Roman Jewish forces of high priest <a href="Hyrcanus%20II">Hyrcanus II</a>, <a href="Phasael">Phasael</a>, and <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herod</a> were defeated by the Parthians and their Jewish ally <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Mattathias">Antigonus II Mattathias</a> (r. 40–37 BC); the latter was made king of Judea while Herod fled to his fort at <a href="Masada">Masada</a>.

Despite these successes, the Parthians were soon driven out of the Levant by a Roman counteroffensive. <a href="Publius%20Ventidius%20Bassus">Publius Ventidius Bassus</a>, an officer under Mark Antony, defeated and then executed Labienus at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Cilician%20Gates">Battle of the Cilician Gates</a> (in modern <a href="Mersin%20Province">Mersin Province</a>, Turkey) in 39 BC. Shortly afterward, a Parthian force in Syria led by general Pharnapates was defeated by Ventidius at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amanus%20Pass">Battle of Amanus Pass</a>.

As a result, Pacorus I temporarily withdrew from Syria. When he returned in the spring of 38 BC, he faced Ventidius at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Gindarus">Battle of Mount Gindarus</a>, northeast of Antioch. Pacorus was killed during the battle, and his forces retreated across the Euphrates. His death spurred a succession crisis in which Orodes II chose <a href="Phraates%20IV%20of%20Parthia">Phraates IV of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 38–2 BC) as his new heir.
Upon assuming the throne, Phraates IV eliminated rival claimants by killing and exiling his own brothers. One of them, Monaeses, fled to Antony and convinced him to <a href="Antony%27s%20Parthian%20War">invade Parthia</a>. Antony defeated Parthia's Judaean ally Antigonus in 37 BC, installing Herod as a client king in his place.

The following year, when Antony marched to <a href="Erzurum">Erzurum</a>, Artavasdes II of Armenia once again switched alliances by sending Antony additional troops. Antony invaded Media <a href="Atropatene">Atropatene</a> (modern <a href="Iranian%20Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a>), then ruled by Parthia's ally <a href="Artavasdes%20I%20of%20Media%20Atropatene">Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene</a>, with the intention of seizing the capital Praaspa, the location of which is now unknown. However, Phraates IV ambushed Antony's rear detachment, destroying a giant <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a> meant for <a href="Siege%20engine">the siege</a> of Praaspa; after this, Artavasdes abandoned Antony's forces.

The Parthians pursued and harassed Antony's army as it fled to Armenia. Eventually, the greatly weakened force reached Syria. After this, Antony lured Artavasdes II into a trap with the promise of a marriage alliance. He was taken captive in 34 BC, paraded in Antony's mock <a href="Roman%20triumph">Roman triumph</a> in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Egypt, and eventually executed by <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a> of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>.

Antony attempted to strike an alliance with Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, whose relations with Phraates IV had recently soured. This was abandoned when Antony and his forces withdrew from Armenia in 33 BC; they escaped a Parthian invasion while Antony's rival Octavian attacked his forces to the west. Following Antony's suicide in Egypt followed by that of <a href="Death%20of%20Cleopatra">his wife Cleopatra</a> in 30 BC, the Parthian ally <a href="Artaxias%20II">Artaxias II</a> reassumed the throne of Armenia.

Following the defeat of Antony and <a href="Reign%20of%20Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra</a> of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> in 31 BC, Octavian consolidated his political power and in 27 BC was named <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> by the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, becoming the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>. Around this time, <a href="Tiridates%20II%20of%20Parthia">Tiridates II of Parthia</a> briefly overthrew Phraates IV, who was able to quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20 BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost <a href="Aquila%20%28Roman%29">legionary standards</a> taken at Carrhae in 53 BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as a small price to pay to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the <a href="Forum%20of%20Augustus">building of a new temple</a> to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a> scene on his statue <a href="Augustus%20of%20Prima%20Porta">Augustus of Prima Porta</a>.
Along with the prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, who later became Queen <a href="Musa%20of%20Parthia">Musa of Parthia</a>. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa convinced Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>". When Phraataces took the throne as <a href="Phraates%20V">Phraates V</a> ("r". c. 2 BC – 4 AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship and the notion of a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory. Phraates' successor <a href="Orodes%20III%20of%20Parthia">Orodes III of Parthia</a> lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by <a href="Vonones%20I">Vonones I</a>, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, <a href="Artabanus%20III%20of%20Parthia">Artabanus III of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 10–38 AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.

During the reign of Artabanus III, two Jewish commoners and brothers, <a href="Anilai%20and%20Asinai">Anilai and Asinai</a> from <a href="Nehardea">Nehardea</a> (near modern <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a>, Iraq), led a revolt against the Parthian governor of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus III, who feared further rebellion elsewhere. Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of fear he would attack Anilai over his marriage to a <a href="gentile">gentile</a>. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him. With the Jewish regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the <a href="Iraqi%20Jews">local Jewish community</a>, forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35–36 AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> and <a href="Aramaeans">Aramaeans</a>. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and <a href="Nisibis">Nisibis</a>.
Although at peace with Parthia, Rome still interfered in its affairs. The Roman emperor <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (r. 14–37 AD) became involved in a plot by <a href="Pharasmanes%20I%20of%20Iberia">Pharasmanes I of Iberia</a> to place his brother <a href="Mithridates%20of%20Armenia">Mithridates</a> on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus III tried and failed to restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>. The Romans released a hostage prince, <a href="Tiridates%20III%20of%20Parthia">Tiridates III of Parthia</a>, to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' death in 38 AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor <a href="Vardanes%20I">Vardanes I</a> and his brother <a href="Gotarzes%20II%20of%20Parthia">Gotarzes II of Parthia</a>. After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> ("r". 41–54 AD) in 49 AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of <a href="Edessa%2C%20Mesopotamia">Edessa</a> and <a href="Izates%20bar%20Monobaz">Izates bar Monobaz</a> of <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a>; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was allowed to live after having his ears mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne.

In 97 AD, the Chinese general <a href="Ban%20Chao">Ban Chao</a>, the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20the%20Western%20Regions">Protector-General of the Western Regions</a>, sent his emissary <a href="Gan%20Ying">Gan Ying</a> on a diplomatic mission to reach the Roman Empire. Gan visited the court of <a href="Pacorus%20II">Pacorus II</a> at Hecatompylos before departing towards Rome. He traveled as far west as the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, where Parthian authorities convinced him that an arduous sea voyage around the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> was the only means to reach Rome. Discouraged by this, Gan Ying returned to the Han court and provided <a href="Emperor%20He%20of%20Han">Emperor He of Han</a> ("r". 88–105 AD) with a detailed report on the Roman Empire based on oral accounts of his Parthian hosts. William Watson speculates that the Parthians would have been relieved at the failed efforts by the Han Empire to open diplomatic relations with Rome, especially after Ban Chao's <a href="Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu%20War">military victories</a> against the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> in <a href="Tarim%20Basin">eastern Central Asia</a>. However, Chinese records maintain that a <a href="Daqin">Roman embassy</a>, perhaps only a group of <a href="Roman%20commerce">Roman merchants</a>, <a href="Sino-Roman%20relations">arrived at the Han capital</a> <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a> by way of <a href="Jiaozhi">Jiaozhi</a> (northern <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>) in 166 AD, during the reigns of <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> ("r". 161–180 AD) and <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan of Han</a> ("r". 146–168 AD). Although it could be coincidental, <a href="Antonine">Antonine</a> Roman golden <a href="medal">medal</a>lions dated to the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his predecessor <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> have been discovered at <a href="Oc%20Eo">Oc Eo</a>, Vietnam (among other Roman artefacts in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>), a site that is one of the suggested locations for the port city of "<a href="Cattigara">Cattigara</a>" along the "<a href="Magnus%20Sinus">Magnus Sinus</a>" (i.e. <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> and <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>) in <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s "<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>".

After the <a href="Caucasian%20Iberia">Iberian king</a> Pharasmanes I had his son <a href="Rhadamistus">Rhadamistus</a> ("r". 51–55 AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, <a href="Vologeses%20I%20of%20Parthia">Vologeses I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 51–77 AD) planned to invade and place his brother, the later <a href="Tiridates%20I%20of%20Armenia">Tiridates I of Armenia</a>, on the throne. Rhadamistus was eventually driven from power, and, beginning with the reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the <a href="Arsacid%20Dynasty%20of%20Armenia">Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia</a>. Even after the fall of the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a> kings with the <a href="Arsacid%20dynasty%20of%20Iberia">Arsacid dynasty of Iberia</a>, and for many centuries afterwards in <a href="Caucasian%20Albania">Caucasian Albania</a> through the <a href="Arsacid%20Dynasty%20of%20Caucasian%20Albania">Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania</a>.

When <a href="Vardanes%20II%20of%20Parthia">Vardanes II of Parthia</a> rebelled against his father Vologeses I in 55 AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly attempted to fill the political vacuum left behind. In the <a href="Roman%E2%80%93Parthian%20War%20of%2058%E2%80%9363">Roman–Parthian War of 58–63</a> AD, the commander <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Corbulo">Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo</a> achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing <a href="Tigranes%20VI%20of%20Armenia">Tigranes VI of Armenia</a> as a Roman client. However, Corbulo's successor <a href="Lucius%20Caesennius%20Paetus">Lucius Caesennius Paetus</a> was soundly defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia. Following a peace treaty, Tiridates I traveled to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a> ("r". 54–68 AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal <a href="diadem">diadem</a> on his head.

A long period of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the invasion of <a href="Alans">Alans</a> into Parthia's eastern territories around 72 AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern <a href="Fertile%20Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a>, the heart of the Parthian Empire along the <a href="Tigris%20River">Tigris</a> and <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially <a href="Nabataeans">Nabataeans</a>), but later established a permanent "<a href="auxilia">auxilia</a>" force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers ("<a href="sagittarii">sagittarii</a>") and even mail-armored <a href="cataphract">cataphract</a>s in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible <a href="grand%20strategy">grand strategy</a> in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the advancement of the personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.
Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when <a href="Osroes%20I%20of%20Parthia">Osroes I of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 109–128 AD) deposed the Armenian king <a href="Sanatruk">Sanatruk</a> and replaced him with <a href="Axidares%20of%20Armenia">Axidares</a>, son of Pacorus II, without consulting Rome. The Roman emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> ("r". 98–117 AD) had the next Parthian nominee for the throne, Parthamasiris, killed in 114 AD, instead making Armenia a Roman province. His forces, led by <a href="Lusius%20Quietus">Lusius Quietus</a>, also captured Nisibis; its occupation was essential to securing all the major routes across the northern Mesopotamian plain. The following year, Trajan invaded Mesopotamia and met little resistance from only <a href="Meharaspes">Meharaspes</a> of Adiabene, since Osroes was engaged in a civil war to the east with <a href="Vologases%20III%20of%20Parthia">Vologases III of Parthia</a>. Trajan spent the winter of 115–116 at Antioch, but resumed his campaign in the spring. Marching down the Euphrates, he captured Dura-Europos, the capital Ctesiphon and Seleucia, and even subjugated Characene, where he watched ships depart to India from the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>.
In the last months of 116 AD, Trajan captured the Persian city of Susa. When <a href="Sanatruces%20II%20of%20Parthia">Sanatruces II of Parthia</a> gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin <a href="Parthamaspates%20of%20Parthia">Parthamaspates of Parthia</a> betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east. On Trajan's return north, the Babylonian settlements revolted against the Roman garrisons. Trajan was forced to retreat from Mesopotamia in 117 AD, overseeing a failed siege of <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a> during his withdrawal. His retreat was—in his intentions—temporary, because he wanted to renew the attack on Parthia in 118 AD and "make the subjection of the Parthians a reality," but Trajan died suddenly in August 117 AD. During his campaign, Trajan was granted the title "Parthicus" by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming the conquest of Parthia. However, only the 4th-century AD historians <a href="Eutropius%20%28historian%29">Eutropius</a> and <a href="Festus%20%28historian%29">Festus</a> allege that he attempted to establish a <a href="Mesopotamia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman province</a> in lower Mesopotamia.

Trajan's successor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> ("r". 117–138 AD) reaffirmed the <a href="Roman-Parthian%20Wars">Roman-Parthian</a> border at the Euphrates, choosing not to invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources. Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of <a href="Osroene">Osroene</a>. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by <a href="Vologases%20IV%20of%20Parthia">Vologases IV of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 147–191 AD) who ushered in a period of peace and stability. However, the <a href="Roman%E2%80%93Parthian%20War%20of%20161%E2%80%93166">Roman–Parthian War of 161–166</a> AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> ("r". 161–180 AD) had co-ruler <a href="Lucius%20Verus">Lucius Verus</a> ("r". 161–169 AD) guard Syria while <a href="Marcus%20Statius%20Priscus">Marcus Statius Priscus</a> invaded Armenia in 163 AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by <a href="Avidius%20Cassius">Avidius Cassius</a> in 164 AD. The Romans captured and burnt Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, yet they were forced to retreat once the Roman soldiers contracted a <a href="Antonine%20Plague">deadly disease</a> (possibly <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>) that soon ravaged the Roman world. Although they withdrew, from this point forward the city of Dura-Europos remained in Roman hands. When Roman emperor <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> ("r". 193–211 AD) invaded Mesopotamia in 197 AD during the reign of <a href="Vologases%20V%20of%20Parthia">Vologases V of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 191–208 AD), the Romans once again marched down the Euphrates and captured Seleucia and Ctesiphon. After assuming the title "Parthicus Maximus", he retreated in late 198 AD, failing as Trajan once did to capture Hatra during a siege.
Around 212 AD, soon after <a href="Vologases%20VI%20of%20Parthia">Vologases VI of Parthia</a> ("r". c. 208–222 AD) took the throne, his brother <a href="Artabanus%20V%20of%20Parthia">Artabanus V of Parthia</a> (d. 224 AD) rebelled against him and gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> ("r". 211–217 AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the marriage was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered <a href="Arbil">Arbil</a> east of the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> river. Caracalla was assassinated the next year on the road to Carrhae by his soldiers. After this debacle, the Parthians made a settlement with <a href="Macrinus">Macrinus</a> ("r". 217–218) where the Romans paid Parthia over two-hundred million "<a href="Denarius">denarii</a>" with additional gifts.

The Parthian Empire, weakened by internal strife and wars with Rome, was soon to be followed by the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a>. Indeed, shortly afterward, <a href="Ardashir%20I">Ardashir I</a>, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern <a href="Fars%20Province">Fars Province</a>, Iran) from <a href="Estakhr">Estakhr</a> began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hormozdg%C4%81n">Battle of Hormozdgān</a> on 28 April 224 AD, perhaps at a site near <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228 AD.

The Sassanians would not only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but they would also attempt to restore the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by <a href="Byzantine-Sassanid%20War%20of%20602%E2%80%93628">briefly conquering</a> the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> during the reign of <a href="Khosrau%20II">Khosrau II</a> ("r". 590–628 AD). However, they would lose these territories to <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a>—the last Roman emperor before the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Arab conquests</a>. Nevertheless, for a period of more than 400 years, they succeeded the Parthian realm as Rome's principal rival.

Local and foreign written accounts, as well as non-textual artifacts, have been used to reconstruct Parthian history. Although the Parthian court maintained records, the Parthians had no formal study of <a href="history">history</a>; the earliest <a href="universal%20history">universal history</a> of Iran, the "<a href="Khwaday-Namag">Khwaday-Namag</a>", was not compiled until the reign of the last Sassanid ruler <a href="Yazdegerd%20III">Yazdegerd III</a> (r. 632–651 AD). Indigenous <a href="Primary%20source">sources</a> on Parthian history remain scarce, with fewer of them available than for any other period of Iranian history. Most contemporary written records on Parthia contain Greek as well as Parthian and Aramaic inscriptions. The Parthian language was written in a distinct script derived from the <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet%23Achaemenid%20period">Imperial Aramaic chancellery script</a> of the Achaemenids, and later developed into the <a href="Pahlavi%20scripts">Pahlavi writing system</a>.

The most valuable indigenous sources for reconstructing an accurate chronology of Arsacid rulers are the metal <a href="drachma">drachma</a> coins issued by each ruler. These represent a "transition from non-textual to textual remains," according to historian <a href="Geo%20Widengren">Geo Widengren</a>. Other Parthian sources used for reconstructing chronology include <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> astronomical tablets and colophons discovered in Babylonia. Indigenous textual sources also include stone <a href="inscription">inscription</a>s, <a href="parchment">parchment</a> and <a href="papyri">papyri</a> documents, and pottery <a href="ostraca">ostraca</a>. For example, at the early Parthian capital of Mithradatkert/Nisa in Turkmenistan, large caches of pottery ostraca have been found yielding information on the sale and storage of items like wine. Along with parchment documents found at sites like Dura-Europos, these also provide valuable information on Parthian governmental administration, covering issues such as taxation, military titles, and provincial organization.
The <a href="Greek%20historiography">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20historiography">Latin histories</a>, which represent the majority of materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written from the perspective of rivals and wartime enemies. These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history. The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors but also as a culturally refined people; recipes for Parthian dishes in the cookbook "<a href="Apicius">Apicius</a>" exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine. <a href="Apollodorus%20of%20Artemita">Apollodorus of Artemita</a> and <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories. <a href="Isidore%20of%20Charax">Isidore of Charax</a>, who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey. To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a>, <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>, <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, and <a href="Herodian">Herodian</a>.

Parthian history can also be reconstructed via the <a href="Twenty-Four%20Histories">Chinese historical records</a> of events. In contrast to Greek and Roman histories, the early Chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing Parthia, although the habit of Chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works (of undetermined origin) makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events. The Chinese called Parthia "" (Chinese: , <a href="Old%20Chinese%20phonology">Old Chinese pronunciation</a>: "'ansjək"), perhaps after the Greek name for the Parthian city <a href="Merv">Antiochia in Margiana</a> (Greek: Ἀντιόχεια ἡ ἐν τῇ Μαργιανῇ). However, this could also have been a transliteration of "Arsaces", after the dynasty's eponymous founder. The works and historical authors include the "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Shiji</a>" (also known as the "Records of the Grand Historian") by <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a>, the "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Han shu</a>" (Book of Han) by <a href="Ban%20Biao">Ban Biao</a>, <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a>, and <a href="Ban%20Zhao">Ban Zhao</a>, and the "<a href="Book%20of%20Later%20Han">Hou Han shu</a>" (Book of Later Han) by <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a>. They provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early <a href="Saka">Saka</a> invasion of Parthia and valuable political and geographical information. For example, the "Shiji" (ch. 123) describes diplomatic exchanges, exotic gifts given by Mithridates II to the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han court</a>, types of agricultural crops grown in Parthia, production of wine using grapes, itinerant merchants, and the size and location of Parthian territory. The "Shiji" also mentions that the Parthians kept records by "writing horizontally on strips of leather," that is, parchment.

Compared with the earlier Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian government was notably <a href="Decentralization">decentralized</a>. An indigenous historical source reveals that territories overseen by the central government were organized in a similar manner to the Seleucid Empire. They both had a threefold division for their provincial hierarchies: the Parthian <a href="marzb%C4%81n">marzbān</a>, xšatrap, and dizpat, similar to the Seleucid <a href="satrapy">satrapy</a>, <a href="eparchy">eparchy</a>, and hyparchy. The Parthian Empire also contained several subordinate semi-autonomous kingdoms, including the states of <a href="Caucasian%20Iberia">Caucasian Iberia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenia</a>, <a href="Atropatene">Atropatene</a>, <a href="Gordyene">Gordyene</a>, <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a>, <a href="Edessa%2C%20Mesopotamia">Edessa</a>, <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a>, <a href="Mesene">Mesene</a>, <a href="Elymais">Elymais</a>, and <a href="Kings%20of%20Persis">Persis</a>. The state rulers governed their own territories and minted their own coinage distinct from the royal coinage produced at the imperial mints. This was not unlike the earlier Achaemenid Empire, which also had some city-states, and even distant satrapies who were semi-independent but "recognised the supremacy of the king, paid tribute and provided military support", according to Brosius. However, the satraps of Parthian times governed smaller territories, and perhaps had less prestige and influence than their Achaemenid predecessors. During the Seleucid period, the trend of local ruling dynasties with semi-autonomous rule, and sometimes outright rebellious rule, became commonplace, a fact reflected in the later Parthian style of governance.

The King of Kings headed the Parthian government. He maintained <a href="polygamous">polygamous</a> relations, and was usually succeeded by his first-born son. Like the Ptolemies of Egypt, there is also record of Arsacid kings marrying their nieces and perhaps even half-sisters; Queen Musa married her own son, though this was an extreme and isolated case. Brosius provides an extract from a letter written in Greek by King Artabanus II in 21 AD, which addresses the governor (titled "<a href="archon">archon</a>") and citizens of the city of <a href="Susa">Susa</a>. Specific government offices of Preferred Friend, Bodyguard and Treasurer are mentioned and the document also proves that "while there were local jurisdictions and proceedings to appointment to high office, the king could intervene on behalf of an individual, review a case and amend the local ruling if he considered it appropriate."

The hereditary titles of the hierarchic nobility recorded during the reign of the first Sassanid monarch Ardashir I most likely reflect the titles already in use during the Parthian era. There were three distinct tiers of nobility, the highest being the regional kings directly below the King of Kings, the second being those related to the King of Kings only through marriage, and the lowest order being heads of local clans and small territories.

By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility had assumed great power and influence in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings. Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, in his "<a href="Geographica">Geographica</a>", preserved a claim by the Greek philosopher and historian <a href="Poseidonius">Poseidonius</a> that the Council of Parthia consisted of noble kinsmen and <a href="magi">magi</a>, two groups from which "the kings were appointed." Of the great noble Parthian families listed at the beginning of the Sassanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the <a href="House%20of%20Suren">House of Suren</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Karen">House of Karen</a>. The historian <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> noted that members of the Suren family, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations. Later on, some of the Parthian kings would claim Achaemenid descent. This has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease (<a href="neurofibromatosis">neurofibromatosis</a>) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.

The Parthian Empire had no <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a>, yet were able to quickly recruit troops in the event of local crises. There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, <a href="serf">serf</a>s and <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a>, but this royal retinue was small. Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations. Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the "<a href="Shiji">Shiji</a>" maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration.
The main striking force of the Parthian army was its <a href="cataphract">cataphract</a>s, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">mailed armor</a>. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due to the cost of their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as <a href="horse%20archer">horse archer</a>s; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used <a href="composite%20bow">composite bow</a>s and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the <a href="Parthian%20shot">Parthian shot</a>, was a highly effective tactic.
The heavy and light cavalry of Parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a> where a Parthian force defeated a much larger Roman army under Crassus.
Light infantry units, composed of <a href="Conscription">levied commoners</a> and mercenaries, were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges.

The size of the Parthian army is unknown, as is the size of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological excavations in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower. Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land.

Usually made of silver, the <a href="Greek%20drachma">Greek drachma</a> coin, including the <a href="tetradrachm">tetradrachm</a>, was the standard currency used throughout the Parthian Empire. The Arsacids maintained <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">royal mints</a> at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5 g or more than 4.2 g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16 g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.

Although <a href="Culture%20of%20Greece">Greek culture</a> of the Seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> during the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>, the Parthian era witnessed an <a href="Culture%20of%20Iran">Iranian cultural revival</a> in religion, the arts, and even clothing fashions. Conscious of both the Hellenistic and Persian cultural roots of their kingship, the Arsacid rulers styled themselves after the Persian King of Kings and affirmed that they were also "<a href="Philhellenism">philhellenes</a>" ("friends of the Greeks"). The word "philhellene" was inscribed on Parthian coins until the reign of Artabanus II. The discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of Iranian culture in Parthia. Vologases I was the first Arsacid ruler to have the <a href="Pahlavi%20script">Parthian script</a> and <a href="Parthian%20language">language</a> appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek. However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire.
Greek cultural influence did not disappear from the Parthian Empire, however, and there is evidence that the Arsacids enjoyed <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek theatre</a>. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of "<a href="The%20Bacchae">The Bacchae</a>" by the playwright <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> (c. 480–406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the <a href="Theatrical%20property">stage-prop</a> head of <a href="Pentheus">Pentheus</a>.

On his coins, Arsaces I is depicted in apparel similar to Achaemenid satraps. According to A. Shahbazi, Arsaces "deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations, and he calls himself Kārny/Karny (Greek: Autocrator), a title already borne by Achaemenid supreme generals, such as Cyrus the Younger." In line with Achaemenid traditions, rock-relief images of Arsacid rulers were carved at <a href="Mount%20Behistun">Mount Behistun</a>, where <a href="Darius%20I%20of%20Persia">Darius I of Persia</a> (r. 522–486 BC) made <a href="Behistun%20Inscription">royal inscriptions</a>. Moreover, the Arsacids claimed familial descent from <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II of Persia</a> ("r". 404–358 BC) as a means to bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former Achaemenid territories, i.e. as being "legitimate successors of glorious kings" of ancient Iran. <a href="Artabanus%20III">Artabanus III</a> named one of his sons Darius and laid claim to <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus</a>' heritage. The Arsacid kings chose typical Zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the "<a href="Kayanian%20dynasty">heroic background</a>" of the <a href="Avesta">Avesta</a>, according to V.G. Lukonin. The Parthians also adopted the use of the <a href="Babylonian%20calendar">Babylonian calendar</a> with names from the Achaemenid <a href="Iranian%20calendar">Iranian calendar</a>, replacing the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20calendar">Macedonian calendar</a> of the Seleucids.

The Parthian Empire, being culturally and politically heterogeneous, had a variety of religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="Persian%20mythology">Iranian</a> cults. Aside from a minority of <a href="Judaism">Jews</a> and early <a href="Christianity">Christians</a>, most Parthians were <a href="polytheistic">polytheistic</a>. Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> was often equated with <a href="Ahura%20Mazda">Ahura Mazda</a>, <a href="Hades">Hades</a> with <a href="Angra%20Mainyu">Angra Mainyu</a>, <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> and <a href="Hera">Hera</a> with <a href="Anahita">Anahita</a>, <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> with <a href="Mithra">Mithra</a>, and <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> with <a href="Shamash">Shamash</a>. Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities. As with Seleucid rulers, Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this <a href="Imperial%20cult">cult of the ruler</a> was perhaps the most widespread.

The extent of Arsacid patronism of <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> is debated in modern scholarship. The followers of <a href="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> would have found the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, there is evidence that Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian <a href="magi">magi</a> priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the <a href="Avesta">Avesta</a>. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.

Although <a href="Mani%20%28prophet%29">Mani</a> (216–276 AD), the founding prophet of <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a>, did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228/229 AD, Bivar asserts that his new faith contained "elements of <a href="Mandaeism">Mandaean</a> belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity ... [it] may be regarded as a typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away."

There is scant archaeological evidence for the spread of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> from the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a> into Iran proper. However, it is known from Chinese sources that <a href="An%20Shigao">An Shigao</a> (fl. 2nd century AD), a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist monk, traveled to <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a> in Han China as a <a href="Silk%20Road%20transmission%20of%20Buddhism">Buddhist missionary</a> and translated several <a href="Buddhist%20texts">Buddhist canons</a> into <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>.

Parthian art can be divided into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the <a href="Iranian%20plateau">Iranian plateau</a>; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, combined elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in <a href="Achaemenid%20art%23Art%20and%20architecture">Achaemenid art</a>, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.

Common <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a> of the Parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the <a href="investiture">investiture</a> of Arsacid kings. Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, <a href="fresco">fresco</a>s, and even <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>. Geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on <a href="stucco">stucco</a> and <a href="plaster">plaster</a> walls. The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.

In <a href="portrait">portrait</a>ure the Parthians favored and emphasized frontality, meaning the person depicted by painting, sculpture, or raised-relief on coins faced the viewer directly instead of showing his or her profile. Although frontality in portraiture was already an old artistic technique by the Parthian period, <a href="Daniel%20Schlumberger">Daniel Schlumberger</a> explains the innovation of Parthian frontality:

'Parthian frontality', as we are now accustomed to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for a small number of traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment "de facto" of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established in the course of the 1st century A.D.
Parthian art, with its distinct use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound cultural and political changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the <a href="Dura-Europos%20synagogue">Dura-Europos synagogue</a>, a temple in the same city dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local <a href="Mithraeum">Mithraeum</a>.

Parthian architecture adopted elements of <a href="Iranian%20architecture">Achaemenid</a> and <a href="Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek architecture</a>, but remained distinct from the two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa. The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vault</a> inside a square space. However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory <a href="rhyton">rhyton</a> vessels, is unquestionably influenced by Greek art.

A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the "<a href="iwan">iwan</a>", an audience hall supported by arches or <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a>s and open on one side. Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the "iwan" was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian "iwans" are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental "iwans" are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian "iwans" at that site have a span of 15 m (50 ft).

The typical Parthian riding outfit is exemplified by <a href="Statue%2C%20National%20Museum%20of%20Iran%202401">the famous bronze statue</a> of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9 m (6 ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped <a href="tunic">tunic</a> fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.

Examples of clothing in Parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt ("qamis"), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a>, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.

Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry. Their many-folded dresses were fastened by a <a href="brooch">brooch</a> at one shoulder. Their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards.

As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses worn by the Parthian kings changed over time. The earliest Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the <a href="bashlyk">bashlyk</a> (Greek: "kyrbasia"). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the <a href="pointy%20hat">pointy hat</a>s depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and <a href="Persepolis">Persepolis</a>. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from the latter part of his reign show him for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian <a href="tiara">tiara</a>, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.

As culturally and religiously tolerant as the Parthians were, they adopted <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> as their <a href="official%20language">official language</a>, while <a href="Old%20Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> remained the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" in the empire. The native <a href="Parthian%20language">Parthian language</a>, <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a>, and <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> were also used.

It is known that during the Parthian period the court <a href="minstrel">minstrel</a> ("gōsān") recited poetic <a href="oral%20literature">oral literature</a> accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written down until the subsequent Sassanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries. It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale "<a href="Vis%20and%20R%C4%81min">Vis and Rāmin</a>" and <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic cycle</a> of the <a href="Kayanian%20dynasty">Kayanian dynasty</a> were part of the corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later.

CMLL World Middleweight Championship

The CMLL World Middleweight Championship (<a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>: "Campeonato Mundial de Peso Medio del CMLL") is a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Nomenclature">world championship</a> promoted by the Mexican wrestling promotion <a href="Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre</a> (CMLL). While lighter <a href="professional%20wrestling%20weight%20classes">weight classes</a> are regularly ignored in wrestling promotions in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, with most emphasis placed on "heavyweights", more emphasis is placed on the lighter classes in <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> companies. The official definition of the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20weight%20classes%23Mexico">middleweight division</a> in Mexico is a person between and , but the weight limits are not strictly adhered to. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via legitimate competition; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline.

El Cuatrero is the reigning champion, having defeated <a href="%C3%81ngel%20de%20Oro">Ángel de Oro</a> for the title on January 19, 2018, at "<a href="Fantastica%20Mania">Fantastica Mania</a>", a joint show held by CMLL and <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling">New Japan Pro Wrestling</a>. Dragón Rojo Jr. is the longest reigning champion in the history of the championship. Since its creation in 1991, there have been 19 individual championship reigns shared between 15 wrestlers. <a href="El%20Dandy">El Dandy</a> is the only three-time champion; he also has the shortest reign of any champion at 63 days.

The middleweight division was one of the first weight divisions in Mexican "<a href="lucha%20libre">lucha libre</a>" to have a specific championship as the <a href="Mexican%20National%20Middleweight%20Championship">Mexican National Middleweight Championship</a> was created in 1933. When the Mexican <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">professional wrestling promotion</a> <a href="Empresa%20Mexicana%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre</a> ("Mexican Wrestling Enterprise"; EMLL) was founded in September 1933, they became one of several Mexican promotions to promote the championship. EMLL later created the World Middleweight Championship to represent the highest level prize of the middleweight division, higher than the Mexican National Middleweight Championship. In 1952, EMLL joined the <a href="National%20Wrestling%20Alliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> (NWA) and changed the title to the <a href="NWA%20World%20Middleweight%20Championship">NWA World Middleweight Championship</a>.
In the late 1980s, EMLL left the NWA over internal politics, and by 1991 they had changed their name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ("World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) to distance themselves from the NWA. At first, they continued to use the name "NWA World Middleweight Championship" as the name had originated with EMLL, but they soon created a series of CMLL-branded world championships, including the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, which became the third middleweight championship in the company. CMLL held a one-night, eight-man tournament to determine the first middleweight champion on December 18, 1991. The tournament final saw <a href="Blue%20Panther">Blue Panther</a> defeat <a href="El%20Sat%C3%A1nico">El Satánico</a> to become the first new titleholder.

In June 1992, many wrestlers left CMLL to join the newly formed <a href="Asistencia%20Asesor%C3%ADa%20y%20Administraci%C3%B3n">Asistencia Asesoría y Administración</a> ("Assistance, Assessment, and Administration"; AAA), which significantly affected CMLL's middleweight championships. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission allowed AAA to assume control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship as the reigning champion <a href="Octag%C3%B3n">Octagón</a> had joined AAA. Meanwhile, the CMLL World Middleweight Championship was vacated after the departure of the champion, Blue Panther. CMLL held a 16-man <a href="Battle%20royal%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">battle royal</a> match to reduce the field to two finalists. <a href="El%20Dandy">El Dandy</a> and <a href="Negro%20Casas">Negro Casas</a> survived the match, and a week later El Dandy defeated Casas to become the second CMLL World Middleweight Champion. The championship has not been vacant since then.

The exodus from CMLL to AAA also meant that CMLL lost control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship as then-reigning champion Octagón was among the wrestlers that left the promotion. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission allowed AAA to take control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship at that point in time. On August 12, 2010, CMLL returned the NWA World Middleweight Championship to the NWA, but immediately replaced it with the <a href="NWA%20World%20Historic%20Middleweight%20Championship">NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship</a> to keep two "world" level championships in the middleweight division.

On May 3, 2010, <a href="Jushin%20Thunder%20Liger">Jushin Thunder Liger</a> defeated Negro Casas to win the CMLL World Middleweight Championship. The match took place in <a href="Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, which was the first time the championship changed hands outside of Mexico and also marked the first time a non-Mexican wrestler held the championship.

<a href="El%20Cuatrero">El Cuatrero</a> is the current champion, having won the title on January 19, 2018, from <a href="%C3%81ngel%20de%20Oro">Ángel de Oro</a>. This is El Cuatrero's first reign as middleweight champion; he is the 19th overall champion. Dragón Rojo Jr. is the wrestler who has held the championship the longest, a total of . El Dandy holds the record for most CMLL World Middleweight Championship reigns with three and is one of only three wrestlers to hold the title more than once, the others being Negro Casas and <a href="Emilio%20Charles%20Jr.">Emilio Charles Jr.</a> <a href="El%20Dandy">El Dandy</a> also held the record for the shortest reignhis second lasted only 63 days.

The official definition of the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20weight%20classes%23Mexico">middleweight division</a> in Mexico is from to . In the 20th century, CMLL was generally consistent and strict about enforcing the actual weight limits, but in the 21st century the official definitions have at times been overlooked for certain champions. One example of this was when <a href="Mephisto%20%28wrestler%29">Mephisto</a>, officially listed as , won the <a href="CMLL%20World%20Welterweight%20Championship">CMLL World Welterweight Championship</a>, a weight class with an upper limit.

With <a href="Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre%23Championships">twelve CMLL-promoted championships labelled as "World" titles</a>, the promotional focus shifts from championship to championship over time with no single championship consistently promoted as the "main" championship; instead CMLL's various major shows feature different weight divisions and are most often headlined by a "<a href="Lucha%20de%20Apuestas">Lucha de Apuestas</a>" ("Bet match") instead of a championship match. From 2013 until June 2016, only two major CMLL shows have featured championship matches: "<a href="Sin%20Salida%20%282013%29">Sin Salida</a>" in 2013 and the 2014 "<a href="Juicio%20Final%20%282014%29">Juicio Final</a>" show featuring the <a href="NWA%20World%20Historic%20Welterweight%20Championship">NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship</a>. Championship matches usually take place under <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Series%20variations">best two-out-of-three falls rules</a>. On occasion, single-fall title matches have taken place, especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to the traditions of the local promotion, illustrated by Jushin Thunder Liger winning the championship during <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling">New Japan Pro Wrestling</a>'s "<a href="Wrestling%20Dontaku%202010">Wrestling Dontaku 2010</a>" in a single-fall match.

In 1991, CMLL held an eight-man, one-night tournament to crown the first ever CMLL World Middleweight Champion. In the end, Blue Panther won the championship by defeating El Satánico.

Due to a large number of wrestlers leaving the company in the summer of 1992, the middleweight championship was vacated, forcing CMLL to hold a tournament. They opted to start out with a 16-man battle royal elimination match as a means to qualify for the final match the following week. Negro Casas and El Dandy outlasted a field of wrestlers that consisted of <a href="Black%20Terry">Guerrero Maya</a>, <a href="%C3%81guila%20Solitaria">Águila Solitaria</a>, Ponzona, Guerrero del Futuro, <a href="Los%20Met%C3%A1licos">Plata</a>, Espectro de Ultratumba, Espectro Jr., <a href="Oro%20%28wrestler%29">Oro</a>, Javier Cruz, <a href="Kung%20Fu%20%28wrestler%29">Kung Fu</a>, <a href="Kato%20Kung%20Lee">Kato Kung Lee</a>, <a href="Ringo%20Mendoza">Ringo Mendoza</a>, <a href="Bestia%20Salvaje">Bestia Salvaje</a> and <a href="%C3%9Altimo%20Drag%C3%B3n">Último Dragón</a>. The following week El Dandy defeated Casas to start his first of three championship reigns.

Richard Adams Cordray (born May 3, 1959) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the first Director of the <a href="Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) from 2012 to 2017. Prior to his appointment, Cordray variously served as <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>'s <a href="Ohio%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>, <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20Ohio">Solicitor General</a>, and <a href="Ohio%20State%20Treasurer">Treasurer</a>.

Cordray was raised near <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> and attended <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>. He was subsequently a <a href="Marshall%20Scholar">Marshall Scholar</a> at <a href="Brasenose%20College%2C%20Oxford">Brasenose College, Oxford</a> and then attended the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">University of Chicago Law School</a>, where he was editor-in-chief of the "<a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20Review">Law Review</a>".

In 1987 he became an undefeated five-time "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" champion.

Cordray was elected to the <a href="Ohio%20House%20of%20Representatives">Ohio House of Representatives</a> in 1990. After <a href="redistricting">redistricting</a>, Cordray decided to run for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in 1992 but was defeated. The following year he was appointed by the <a href="Ohio%20Attorney%20General">Ohio Attorney General</a> as the first <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20Ohio">Solicitor General of Ohio</a>. His experience as Solicitor led to his appearance before the United States Supreme Court to argue six cases. Following Republican victories in Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position and entered the private practice of law. While in private practice he unsuccessfully ran for Ohio Attorney General in 1998 and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in 2000. He was elected Franklin County treasurer in 2002 and reelected in 2004 before being elected <a href="Ohio%20State%20Treasurer">Ohio State Treasurer</a> in 2006.

Cordray was elected Ohio Attorney General in November 2008 to fill the remainder of the term ending in January 2011. In 2010, Cordray lost his bid for reelection to former U.S. Senator <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a>. He became Director of the CFPB via <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> in July 2011 and was confirmed by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> in 2013. Cordray left the agency in late 2017 to run for <a href="governor%20of%20Ohio">governor of Ohio</a>, an election he lost to DeWine.

Cordray was born in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, the middle child between brothers Frank, Jr. and Jim, and was raised in <a href="Grove%20City%2C%20Ohio">Grove City, Ohio</a>, where he attended public schools. At <a href="Grove%20City%20High%20School%20%28Grove%20City%2C%20Ohio%29">Grove City High School</a>, Cordray became a champion on the high school quiz show "In The Know" and worked for <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> at <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a>. He graduated from high school in 1977 as co-<a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> of his class. His first job in politics was as an intern for <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a> as a junior at <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>'s <a href="James%20Madison%20College">James Madison College</a>. Cordray earned <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> honors and graduated <a href="summa%20cum%20laude">summa cum laude</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">BA</a> in Legal & Political Theory in 1981. As a <a href="Marshall%20Scholarship">Marshall Scholar</a>, he earned an <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">MA</a> with first class honours in <a href="Economics">Economics</a> from <a href="Brasenose%20College%2C%20Oxford">Brasenose College, Oxford</a> and earned a <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Varsity Blue</a> in basketball in 1983. At the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">University of Chicago Law School</a>, where he earned his <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> with honors in 1986, he served as editor-in-chief of the "University of Chicago Law Review". After starting work as a <a href="law%20clerk">law clerk</a> at the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, he came back to his high school to deliver the <a href="commencement%20speech">commencement speech</a> for the graduating class of 1988.

Cordray began his career clerking for Judge <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> and <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court associate justices</a> <a href="Byron%20White">Byron White</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a>. After clerking for White in 1987–1988, he was hired by the international law firm <a href="Jones%20Day">Jones Day</a> to work in its Cleveland office.

From 1989 to at least 2000, Cordray taught various courses at <a href="The%20Ohio%20State%20University">The Ohio State University</a> <a href="Moritz%20College%20of%20Law">Moritz College of Law</a> and at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a>.

In 1990 Cordray ran for an Ohio State House of Representatives seat, in the 33rd District (southern and western <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Ohio">Franklin County</a>), against six-term incumbent Republican Don Gilmore. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, he defeated Gilmore by an 18,573–11,944 (61–39%) margin. 

In 1991 the state Apportionment Board, controlled by a 3–2 Republican majority despite the party's 61–38 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following the results of the <a href="1990%20Census">1990 Census</a>, in the hope of retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the 22-year incumbent <a href="Mike%20Stinziano">Mike Stinziano</a>. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for reelection.

Cordray ran for <a href="Ohio%27s%2015th%20congressional%20district">Ohio's 15th congressional district</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201992">1992 U.S. House of Representatives elections</a>, and won the Democratic nomination over Bill Buckel by an 18,731–5,329 (78–22%) margin, following the withdrawal of another candidate, Dave Sommer. Cordray's platform included federal spending cuts, <a href="term%20limits">term limits</a> for Congress and a <a href="line-item%20veto">line-item veto</a> for the president. When Deborah Pryce, then a Franklin County municipal judge, announced that she would vote to support <a href="abortion">abortion</a> rights, Linda S. Reidelbach entered the race as an independent. Thus the general election was a three-way affair, with Pryce taking a <a href="Plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a> of 110,390 votes (44.1%), Cordray 94,907 (37.9%) and Reidelbach 44,906 (17.9%).

While in private practice in 1993, Cordray co-wrote a <a href="legal%20brief">legal brief</a> for the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a>, in a campaign supported by Ohio's attorney general, for the reinstatement of Ohio's <a href="hate%20crime">hate crime</a> laws. This was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, but not ruled on because of its similarity to a previous Wisconsin ruling.

In 1993 the <a href="government%20of%20Ohio">government of Ohio</a> created the office of state solicitor general to handle the state's appellate work. The state solicitor, appointed by the Ohio attorney general, is responsible for cases that are to be argued before the <a href="Ohio%20Supreme%20Court">Ohio Supreme Court</a> and the United States Supreme Court. Until 1998, the Solicitor worked without any support staff. Cordray, who had earlier worked for a summer in the office of the <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">United States solicitor general</a>, was the first Solicitor to be appointed, in September 1993. He held the position until he resigned after Ohio Attorney General <a href="Lee%20Fisher">Lee Fisher</a> was defeated by <a href="Betty%20Montgomery">Betty Montgomery</a> in 1994. His cases before the Supreme Court included "Wilson v. Layne" () and "Hanlon v. Berger" (). Though he lost his first case, he won his second case, which garnered a substantial amount of media attention for its consideration of the constitutionality of media ride-alongs with police. Other cases included "Household Credit Services v. Pfennig" (), "Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington" (), "Demore v. Kim" (), and "Groh v. Ramirez" ().

Cordray contested the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>'s right to erect a cross at the <a href="Ohio%20Statehouse">Ohio Statehouse</a> after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the symbolic meaning of the cross was different from the <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> and <a href="Menorah%20%28Hanukkah%29">menorah</a>, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3 m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Day">Martin Luther King Day</a> (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied to erect a cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Justice Department</a> and two were by the Republican <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> Justice Department.

Cordray was granted a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a> for a <a href="death%20row">death row</a> inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in "Steffen v. Tate" (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.

In early 1996, Cordray was elected to the <a href="Ohio%20Democratic%20Party">Ohio Democratic Party</a> Central Committee from the 15th district by a 5,472–1,718 margin over John J. Kulewicz.

In late 1996 Cordray, who was in private practice at the time, was a leading contender and finalist for a <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> position during the second term of the <a href="Clinton%20Administration">Clinton Administration</a>, along with <a href="Kent%20Markus">Kent Markus</a> and <a href="Sharon%20Zealey">Sharon Zealey</a>. Zealey was eventually selected.

During the 1998 <a href="Ohio%20Attorney%20General%20elections">election for Ohio attorney general</a>, Cordray ran unopposed in the Democratic primary but was defeated, 62%–38%, by one-term Republican incumbent Betty Montgomery.

Cordray entered the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%202000">U.S. Senate elections</a> in a race that began as a three-way contest for the Democratic nomination to oppose first-term Republican incumbent <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a>. The three-way race was unusual since the three candidates (Cordray, Rev. Marvin McMickle, and <a href="Ted%20Celeste">Ted Celeste</a>) were encouraged to campaign together in order to promote name recognition, conserve resources and lessen infighting. Ohio Democratic party leaders believed Cordray was better suited for an Ohio Supreme Court seat and urged him to drop out of the Senate race. Despite the Ohio Democrats not endorsing any candidate in the primary election, the entry of Dan Radakovich as a fourth competitor, and the anticipated entry of former <a href="Mayor%20of%20Cincinnati">Mayor of Cincinnati</a> and television personality <a href="Jerry%20Springer">Jerry Springer</a>, Cordray persisted in his campaign. Celeste, the younger brother of former Ohio governor <a href="Dick%20Celeste">Dick Celeste</a>, won with 369,772 votes. He was trailed by McMickle (the only black Senate candidate in the country in 2000) with 204,811 votes, Cordray with 200,157, and Radakovich with 69,002.

Cordray was unopposed in the May 7, 2002, primary election for the Democratic nomination as Franklin County treasurer. He defeated Republican incumbent Wade Steen, who had been appointed in May 2001 to replace Bobbie M. Hall. The election was close, unofficially 131,199–128,677 (50.5%–49.5%), official margin of victory 3,232. Cordray was the first Democrat to hold the position since 1977, and he assumed office on December 9, 2002, instead of after January 1 because he was filling Hall's unexpired term.

In the 2004 election, the Franklin County Republican party made no endorsement, but Republican Jim Timko challenged Cordray. Cordray defeated him and was elected to a four-year term by a 272,593–153,625 (64%–36%) margin.

As Franklin County treasurer, Cordray focused on four major initiatives: collection of delinquent tax revenue through a tax lien certificate sale, creation of a land bank, personal finance education, and the development of a community outreach program. He managed a portfolio that averaged $650 million and consistently beat its benchmarks, and set new records for delinquent tax collection in Franklin County, which was the only Ohio county with a AAA <a href="credit%20rating">credit rating</a>. He also served as president of the Board of Revision and chair of the Budget Commission. In 2005, Cordray was named the national County Leader of the Year by "<a href="American%20City%20%26amp%3B%20County">American City & County</a>" magazine.

In the 2006 Democratic party primary election for Ohio Treasurer, Cordray was set to face <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Ohio">Montgomery County</a> Treasurer Hugh Quill, but Quill withdrew before the election. He defeated Republican nominee Sandra O'Brien for state treasurer in the 2006 election. Cordray succeeded <a href="Jennette%20Bradley">Jennette Bradley</a> in a near-statewide sweep by the Democratic Party. Cordray noted that when he assumed statewide office, Ohio was challenged with restoring public trust after the misdeeds of former <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Ohio">Ohio Governor</a> <a href="Bob%20Taft">Bob Taft</a>. Referring to what would be required to follow Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann and his interim successor Nancy Rogers, he said: "... we have been patiently rebuilding the public trust there [in the state government] and I think it would be a very similar task there in the Attorney General's office."

Cordray announced his 2008 candidacy for Ohio state attorney general on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor <a href="Ted%20Strickland">Ted Strickland</a>. The vacancy in the office of the attorney general was created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of <a href="Marc%20Dann">Marc Dann</a>, who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, <a href="Jim%20Petro">Jim Petro</a>, DeWine, <a href="Maureen%20O%27Connor">Maureen O'Connor</a>, and <a href="Rob%20Portman">Rob Portman</a> declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were <a href="Michael%20Crites">Michael Crites</a> (<a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>), and <a href="Robert%20M.%20Owens">Robert M. Owens</a> (<a href="independent%20politician">Independent</a>). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents, with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites's campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association "<a href="The%20Columbus%20Dispatch">The Columbus Dispatch</a>" called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>.

Ohio statewide offices are regularly contested every four years in the <a href="United%20States%20midterm%20election">midterm election</a> years. 2008 was a <a href="Classes%20of%20United%20States%20Senators">Class 2</a> senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Crites, 57%-38%.

Bank of America
In July 2009, <a href="Denny%20Chin">Denny Chin</a>, a <a href="judge">judge</a> on the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">Southern District of New York</a>, granted lead <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> status to a group of five public <a href="pension%20funds">pension funds</a> for investor <a href="class-action">class-action</a> lawsuits against the <a href="Bank%20of%20America%20Corporation">Bank of America Corporation</a> over its <a href="Bank%20of%20America%23Acquisition%20of%20Merrill%20Lynch">acquisition</a> of <a href="Merrill%20Lynch%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Merrill Lynch & Company</a>. The claim was that Bank of America misled investors about Merrill's financial well-being prior to the January 1, 2009 acquisition despite awareness that Merrill was headed toward a significant loss that amounted to $15.84 billion in its fourth quarter. The suit also alleged that significant payments were concealed.

The curious dealings led to congressional hearings about why the merger commenced without any disclosures. In September 2009, Cordray, on behalf of Ohio's largest public employee pension funds (State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System), the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and pension funds from Sweden and the Netherlands, filed suit alleging that Bank of America, its directors and four executives (Bank of America Chief Executive <a href="Ken%20Lewis%20%28executive%29">Kenneth Lewis</a>, Bank of America <a href="Chief%20Financial%20Officer">Chief Financial Officer</a> Joe Price, accounting chief Neil Cotty and former Merrill chairman and CEO <a href="John%20Thain">John Thain</a>) acted to conceal Merrill's growing losses from <a href="shareholder">shareholder</a>s voted to approve the deal the prior December.

Prior to the filing the five funds had filed individual complaints, but the September filing of an amended complaint joined the actions with Cordray representing the lead plaintiff. The amended complaint included details about conversations and communications between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives that were revealed in media reports, congressional testimony and investigations by the <a href="Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. The filing was an attempt to recover losses endured when Bank of America's share price fell after the transaction. The damages were sought from Bank of America, individual executives, the bank's <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a>, including any insurers that cover directors' legal liabilities. Among the specifics of the claim were that Bank of America agreed to allow Merrill Lynch to pay as much as $5.8 billion in undisclosed year-end discretionary bonuses to executives and employees and that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives were aware of billions of dollars in losses suffered by Merrill Lynch in the two months before the merger vote but failed to disclose them.

Bid rigging case
In April 2010, Cordray reached a $1 billion settlement with <a href="American%20International%20Group">American International Group</a> (AIG), one of four remaining named defendants (along with <a href="Marsh%20%26amp%3B%20McLennan%20Companies">Marsh & McLennan</a>, <a href="The%20Hartford">Hartford Financial Services</a> and <a href="Chubb%20Corp.">Chubb Corp.</a>), in a 2007 <a href="antitrust">antitrust</a> case regarding business practices between 2001 and 2004. The settlement was divided among 26 Ohio universities, cities and schools. <a href="Zurich%20Financial%20Services">Zurich Financial Services</a> settled in 2006. Cordray believes that Marsh was the organizing company for the illegal practices and noted that a trial could commence in 2011. AIG admitted no wrongdoing and said the settlement was to avoid risks and prolonged expenses.

On November 2, 2010, Cordray lost his reelection bid to former U.S. senator <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a> by two points. 
Cordray was repeatedly mentioned as a potential 2014 candidate for governor of Ohio, but after being confirmed to a five-year term to head the CFPB, he declined to run in the 2014 election.

On Wednesday, December 15, 2010, Special Advisor to President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> <a href="Elizabeth%20Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> announced that she had selected Cordray to lead the enforcement arm of the newly created <a href="United%20States%20Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau">United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB), saying, "Richard Cordray has the vision and experience to help us build a team that ensures every lender in the marketplace is playing by the rules." In announcing his appointment to this position Cordray also said that he intended to once again run for statewide office in Ohio in 2014. Cordray described the opportunity to "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" as a chance to resume "... in many ways doing on a 50-state basis the things I cared most about as a state attorney general, with a more robust and a more comprehensive authority."

On July 17, 2011, Cordray was selected over Warren as the head of the entire CFPB, but his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. This was part of a pattern of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator <a href="Richard%20Shelby">Richard Shelby</a> wrote an <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a> article for "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the <a href="Securities%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities Exchange Commission</a> and <a href="Federal%20Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. "<a href="Politico%20%28newspaper%29">Politico</a>" interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the nomination remained on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting for cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans voting against.
On January 4, 2012, a White House communications director announced in a tweet that President Obama would be giving Cordray a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> to the post, bypassing the Senate. The move was criticized by Republican senators, who argued that Congress had not officially been in recess, and that Obama did not have the authority to bypass Congressional approval. 
Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", <a href="Timothy%20Noah">Timothy Noah</a>, a supporter of Cordray, wrote, "As someone who strongly supported a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> for Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'm confused as to why President Obama chose to act today. ... The trouble is that the Senate isn't in recess."

The United States Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on June 26, 2014, that vacated Cordray's appointment and several other recess appointments, in <a href="NLRB%20v.%20Noel%20Canning">NLRB v. Noel Canning</a>, determining that the Senate was not in recess at the time of the appointments.

On January 24, 2013, Obama renominated Cordray as Director of the <a href="United%20States%20Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>.

Amid a push by Senate Democrats in July 2013 to eliminate the filibuster for all executive-branch nominees, senators struck a deal to pave the way for a final, up-or-down vote on Cordray's nomination. The Senate voted 71–29 on July 16, 2013, to invoke <a href="cloture">cloture</a> on Cordray's nomination, and confirmed Cordray in a 66–34 vote the same day. Republican groups including <a href="American%20Rising">American Rising Squared</a> and Congressman <a href="Jeb%20Hensarling">Jeb Hensarling</a> filed complaints that Cordray had violated the Hatch Act by considering a run for governor of Ohio while serving as the Director of the CFPB. The <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20Special%20Counsel">United States Office of Special Counsel</a> cleared Cordray of any wrongdoing.

Cordray has said that after President Trump was inaugurated, Trump and <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a> Director <a href="Mick%20Mulvaney">Mick Mulvaney</a> worked to undermine Cordray and the CFPB. On November 15, 2017, Cordray announced his resignation as director of the CFPB, <a href="Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau%232017%20dispute%20over%20acting%20director">sparking a legal dispute</a> over who would succeed him as acting director.

On December 5, 2017, Cordray announced his candidacy for <a href="Governor%20of%20Ohio">Governor of Ohio</a> in the <a href="Ohio%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202018">2018 election</a>. He won the Democratic primary on May 8, 2018, and faced Republican challenger and Ohio Attorney General <a href="Mike%20DeWine">Mike DeWine</a> in the general election. On August 1, 2018, former President Barack Obama endorsed Cordray for governor. In the general election held November 6, 2018, DeWine defeated Cordray with 50.7% of the vote to Cordray's 46.4%; third-party candidates received 2.9%.

On July 11, 1992, Cordray married Margaret "Peggy" Cordray, a law professor at <a href="Capital%20University%20Law%20School">Capital University Law School</a>. The Cordrays have twins, a daughter and son, and reside near <a href="Grove%20City%2C%20Ohio">Grove City, Ohio</a>. His father retired as an Orient Developmental Center program director for <a href="Intellectual%20disability">intellectually disabled</a> residents after 43 years of service. His mother, Ruth Cordray, from <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, died in 1980. She was a social worker, teacher and founder of Ohio's first foster grandparent program for individuals with developmental disabilities. Richard Cordray carried the <a href="Olympic%20Flame">Olympic Flame</a> through <a href="Findlay%2C%20Ohio">Findlay, Ohio</a>, as part of the nationwide torch relay to the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">1996 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> and has served as a member of the Advisory Board for the Friends of the Homeless and part of <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>'s select group known as Leadership '98.

Cordray has the distinction of being an undefeated five-time champion and <a href="Jeopardy%21%20Tournament%20of%20Champions">Tournament of Champions</a> semifinalist on "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first-round win in the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the "<a href="Super%20Jeopardy%21">Super Jeopardy!</a>" elimination tournament of champions, as <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding "<a href="List%20of%20Jeopardy%21%20tournaments%20and%20events%23Celebrity%20Jeopardy%21">Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>"). But he did compete in the <a href="Jeopardy%21%20Battle%20of%20the%20Decades">Battle of the Decades tournament</a>, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, and finishing second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, he turned down the $5,000 he won for that appearance.

CMLL World Heavyweight Championship

The CMLL World Heavyweight Championship () is a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="Championship%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23World%20championships">world heavyweight championship</a> established in 1991 and promoted by <a href="Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre</a> (CMLL). CMLL introduced the championship to signal their independence from the <a href="National%20Wrestling%20Alliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> (NWA), whose titles they had continued to promote after leaving the alliance in the late 1980s. As part of the move away from the NWA, CMLL established championships designated as "CMLL World Championships" for several weight divisions. The Heavyweight Championship was the first CMLL title to be created, and the inaugural champion was <a href="Konnan%20el%20B%C3%A1rbaro">Konnan el Bárbaro</a>, who won the title on June 9, 1991. The current champion is <a href="%C3%9Altimo%20Guerrero">Último Guerrero</a>, who is in his second reign. He defeated <a href="Diamante%20Azul">Diamante Azul</a> in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant title on October 16, 2018. Sixteen different wrestlers have held the championship, split over twenty separate championship reigns.

In most <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">professional wrestling promotion</a>s around the world, the "world heavyweight" designation is used to indicate the highest-ranking championship instead of an actual weight division. Traditionally, however, "<a href="lucha%20libre">lucha libre</a>" has used multiple weight divisions, often with the lower weight classes receiving more attention from the promoters. CMLL carries on this tradition. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is won not by actual competition, but by a <a href="kayfabe">scripted ending</a> to a match.

The Mexican <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">professional wrestling promotion</a> <a href="Empresa%20Mexicana%20de%20Lucha%20Libre">Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre</a> (EMLL) was founded in 1933 and initially recognized a series of "Mexican National" wrestling championships, endorsed by the "Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F." (Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling <a href="Commissioner%23Sports">Commission</a>). The <a href="Mexican%20National%20Heavyweight%20Championship">Mexican National Heavyweight Championship</a> was created in 1926, and over time, EMLL began promoting matches for that championship with the approval and oversight of the wrestling commission.

In the late 1980s, EMLL left the NWA to avoid their politics and would later rebrand themselves as "Consejo Mundal de Lucha Libre" (CMLL). Although they had left the NWA, they were still promoting the NWA's titles. By the start of the 1990s, CMLL began to downplay the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship bouts, featuring them less frequently on CMLL shows, and eventually stopped promoting them altogether. In 1991, CMLL began creating a series of CMLL-branded world championships, the first of which was for the heavyweight division.} The first champion was crowned in the finals of a 16-man tournament that saw <a href="Konnan%20el%20B%C3%A1rbaro">Konnan el Bárbaro</a> defeat <a href="Cien%20Caras">Cien Caras</a>. Konnan lost the title to Cien Caras in his first title defense on August 18, 1991, making him one of three champions without a single successful title defense.

On April 18, 1997, <a href="Sean%20Morley">Steel</a> became the first <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> to win the championship by defeating then-champion <a href="Rayo%20de%20Jalisco%20Jr.">Rayo de Jalisco Jr.</a> to become the eighth overall champion. In September 1997, Steel signed a contract with the <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment">World Wrestling Federation</a> (WWF, now WWE) forcing CMLL to <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23V">vacate</a> the championship for the second time. Instead of holding a traditional tournament to crown another champion, CMLL had the new champion decided in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches">triple threat match</a> between the top three heavyweight contenders, <a href="Universo%202000">Universo 2000</a>, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., and Cien Caras. On October 19, 1997, Universo 2000 won the title, starting the first of his three reigns, more than any other wrestler. Universo 2000 lost the title to and regained the title from Rayo de Jalisco Jr. Universo 2000's second reign as champion lasted 1,225 days, the championship's longest reign. This record-breaking run ended on April 18, 2003, when <a href="Mr.%20Niebla">Mr. Niebla</a> won the title. Mr. Niebla was champion for 543 days before Universo 2000 regained the championship for his record-setting third reign.

On July 8, 2007, <a href="Dos%20Caras%20Jr.">Dos Caras Jr.</a> became the fourteenth overall champion. His reign lasted 533 days, but only saw him defend the title a few times, defeating Lizmark Jr. and <a href="%C3%9Altimo%20Guerrero">Último Guerrero</a>. On December 22, 2008, Último Guerrero won the championship from Dos Caras Jr., who shortly afterwards left CMLL to work for WWE. On April 2, 2009, Último Guerrero successfully defended the title against <a href="Villano%20V">Rey Mendoza Jr.</a> on an independent wrestling promotion show in <a href="Gomez%20Palacio">Gomez Palacio</a>, marking the first time the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship was defended on a non-CMLL promoted show. After a 963-day reign and 17 successful defenses, Guerrero lost the title to <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20Garza">Héctor Garza</a> on August 12, 2011. The championship was vacated on November 11, 2011, after Garza left CMLL for "<a href="Perros%20del%20Mal%20%28promotion%29">Perros del Mal Producciones</a>", a group of former CMLL wrestlers who broke away from the promotion in late 2011. On January 1, 2012, <a href="El%20Terrible">El Terrible</a> became the new champion when he defeated <a href="CMLL%20World%20Light%20Heavyweight%20Championship">CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Rush%20%28wrestler%29">Rush</a> in a decision match. The two had won a "<a href="torneo%20cibernetico">torneo cibernetico</a>" match a week earlier to earn spots in the match.

<a href="M%C3%A1ximo%20%28wrestler%29">Máximo Sexy</a> won the championship on January 30, 2015, by defeating El Terrible. On May 22, 2017, then-reigning champion Máximo Sexy was fired by CMLL for his involvement in an act of vandalism and the championship was vacated. On June 6, 2017 <a href="Marco%20Corleone">Marco Corleone</a> won a 10-man "torneo cibernetico" elimination match to become the new CMLL World Heavyweight Champion.

The current champion is Último Guerrero; who won the title on October 16, 2018, after defeating Diamante Azul in the finals of a tournament for the previously vacant title.

Universo 2000 holds the record for the most reigns at three. His second reign is the longest in the title's history at 1,225 days, and he also holds the record for the longest combined reign with 2,555 days. Konnan, who was the inaugural champion, holds the record for the shortest reign at 70 days. Three champions never had a successful title defense: both Garza and Steel left CMLL before they could defend the championship, and Konnan lost the championship in his first defense.

CMLL has been forced to declare the championship vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.

The championship is designated as a <a href="Lucha%20libre%23Weight%20classes">heavyweight title</a>, which means that the championship can officially only be competed for by wrestlers weighing and above. In the 20th century, Mexican wrestling enforced the weight divisions more strictly, but in the 21st century, the rules were occasionally ignored for the various weight divisions. The Heavyweight Championship was no exception as several champions were under the weight limit, including Héctor Garza, who was billed as weighing when he won the championship and was thus considered a <a href="Lucha%20libre%23Weight%20classes">Junior Light Heavyweight</a>. While the "world heavyweight" title is traditionally considered the most prestigious weight division in most professional wrestling promotions, CMLL places more emphasis on the lower weight divisions, and the CMLL World Heavyweight title is not considered the top CMLL championship.

With a total of twelve CMLL championships being labeled as "World" titles, the promotional focus shifts over time with no single championship being promoted as the "main" one. Championship matches are usually decided by <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Series%20variations">two-out-of-three falls</a>. On occasion, single-fall title matches have taken place, especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to the traditions of the local promotion.

The tournament to crown the inaugural CMLL World Heavyweight Champion ran from May 24 to June 9, 1991, and featured 16 competitors. The first round of the tournament saw two eight-man <a href="Battle%20royal%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">battle royals</a>, each ending when four wrestlers were left in the ring. This was used to cut the field in half with the last four remaining wrestlers from each match advancing to the next round. Konnan, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., Black Magic, and Mascara Ano 2000 advanced in the first battle royal, while Brazo de Plata, <a href="Vampiro%20Canadiense">Vampiro Canadiense</a>, Universo 2000, and El Egipcio were eliminated. In the second battle royal, <a href="Tyler%20Mane">Nitron</a>, <a href="Pierroth%20Jr.">Pierroth Jr.</a>, <a href="Pirata%20Morgan">Pirata Morgan</a>, and Cien Caras advanced while <a href="Ken%20Timbs">Fabulous Blondie</a>, <a href="Gran%20Markus%20Jr.">Gran Markus Jr.</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1scara%20Sagrada">Máscara Sagrada</a>, and El Egipcio were eliminated. The second round saw another pair of battle royals with four men in each, ending when two wrestlers were left in the ring. This narrowed the tournament down to the final four wrestlers, who faced off in traditional semi-finals matches, before the final match to crown the inaugural champion.

After Cien Caras left CMLL for AAA in 1992, CMLL decided to hold a traditional 16-man single-elimination tournament to crown a new World Heavyweight Champion. The tournament ran from October 30 to November 20, 1992. On the first night of the tournament, all sixteen competitors competed in a battle royal where the order of elimination determined the pairings for the first round. The last two wrestlers were Vampiro and El Egipico, who faced off in the last of the first round matches. The first two matches of the first round were held on November 3, at CMLL's weekly ""Martes de Coliseo"" show where Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Rick Patterson both won their matches, followed by Jalisco Jr. winning his quarterfinal match the same night. On November 6, at the weekly "<a href="CMLL%20Super%20Viernes">CMLL Super Viernes</a>" show, <a href="Haku%20%28wrestler%29">King Haku</a> and Brazo de Plata advanced in the first round with King Haku qualifying for the semi-final match with another victory. On November 8, an additional tournament match was held with Pirata Morgan advancing to the second round. The November 10 show saw Black Magic and <a href="Kahoz">Kahoz</a> advance to face each other, with Black Magic moving to the semi-finals. On November 11, CMLL held the final first round and quarterfinal match, which Vampiro won, and then held both of the semi-finals on the same night. By the end of the night, Black Magic and Jalisco Jr. qualified for the final. The following week, at the November 20 "Super Viernes", Black Magic won the finals and became the third CMLL World Heavyweight Champion.

On December 18, 2011, CMLL announced that their World Heavyweight Champion Héctor Garza had decided to leave CMLL to work for "<a href="Perros%20del%20Mal%20%28promotion%29">Perros del Mal Producciones</a>", vacating the championship. They also announced that the following week there would be a tournament to determine a new champion. The main event of the December 25 "Domigos <a href="Arena%20M%C3%A9xico">Arena México</a>" show was a 10-man "<a href="torneo%20cibernetico">torneo cibernetico</a>" elimination match designed to reduce the field of championship contenders from ten to two. The match ended when El Terrible pinned <a href="Marco%20Corleone">Marco Corleone</a> to eliminate him, leaving El Terrible and Rush to face off the following week. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible defeated Rush in two-out-of-three falls to become the seventeenth overall champion.

Then-reigning CMLL World Heavyweight Champion Máximo Sexy was fired by CMLL on May 22, 2017 and the championship was declared vacant. The company announced that they were holding a 10-man "torneo cibernetico" on June 6, 2017 in Guadalajara, Jalisco to determine the next champion. The "torneo ciberntico" sides pitted <a href="Gran%20Guerrero">Gran Guerrero</a>, <a href="Euforia%20%28wrestler%29">Euforia</a>, El Terrible, Rush and <a href="Comandante%20Pierroth">Pierroth</a> against <a href="Marco%20Corleone">Marco Corleone</a>, <a href="Drag%C3%B3n%20Rojo%20Jr.">Dragón Rojo Jr.</a>, <a href="Kr%C3%A1neo">Kráneo</a>, Mr. Niebla and <a href="Rey%20Bucanero">Rey Bucanero</a>. The match came down to former champion El Terrible and Corleone, with Corleone gaining the deciding pinfall and the championship. With the victory, he became the 19th overall champion.

The mangrove swallow ("Tachycineta albilinea") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family that breeds in coastal regions from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> through <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> to <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. It has blue-green upperparts, blackish <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s, a white rump, a black tail, and white underparts. It can be identified by the white streak, the white line near its eye, which only occurs in two other species of "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>": the <a href="violet-green%20swallow">violet-green swallow</a> and the <a href="white-rumped%20swallow">white-rumped swallow</a>. The sexes, although similar in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, differ slightly in size. The juveniles have grey-brown upperparts and white-washed underparts. This swallow's <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a> is generally described as a soft trilling, with a rolled "jeerrt" call, and a sharp alarm note.

The mangrove swallow is very <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> when breeding, much like the related <a href="tree%20swallow">tree swallow</a>. Its <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> is normally built in a hole or crevice near water and less than above the ground. This species usually feeds alone when breeding, but will feed in groups when not. It normally forages closer to the nest when <a href="Bird%23Parental%20care%20and%20fledging">hunting for its chicks</a>, but will go much further when foraging for itself. In between foraging attempts, it is frequently seen perching near water. It is an aerial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a> and eats unusually large <a href="predation">prey</a> for its size.

With an estimated population of at least 500,000 individuals, the mangrove swallow is classified as a species of <a href="least-concern%20species">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Its numbers are decreasing, although not fast enough for it to be classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. Little is known about the predation of this species, although it is a <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> of "<a href="Sternostoma%20hirundinis">Sternostoma hirundinis</a>", a type of nasal <a href="mite">mite</a>. It has also been known to lose nests both to <a href="termite">termite</a>s and <a href="black%20fly">black flies</a>.

The mangrove swallow was formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1863 as "Petrochelidon albilinea" by American amateur <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="George%20Newbold%20Lawrence">George Newbold Lawrence</a>. Its current <a href="genus">genus</a>, "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>", was originally described in 1850 by the German ornithologist <a href="Jean%20Cabanis">Jean Cabanis</a>. The genus name "Tachycineta" is from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "takhukinetos", "moving quickly", and the specific "albilinea" is from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "albus", "white", and "linea", "line".

The "Tachycineta" species are members of the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family of birds, and are placed in the Hirundininae subfamily, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a>s. <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. These groups are the "core martins", including burrowing species like the <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>, the "nest-adopters", which are birds that utilise natural cavities, and the "mud nest builders" such as the "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>" house martins. The "Tachycineta" species belong to the "nest-adopter" group.

All nine "Tachycineta" species have glossy blue or green backs and white underparts, but the five species with white rumps – the mangrove swallow, <a href="Tumbes%20swallow">Tumbes swallow</a>, <a href="white-winged%20swallow">white-winged swallow</a>, <a href="white-rumped%20swallow">white-rumped swallow</a> and <a href="Chilean%20swallow">Chilean swallow</a> – are particularly closely related, the first three and the last two forming two <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>. The Tumbes swallow of coastal Peru was formerly considered to be a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the mangrove swallow, but its calls, behaviour, and <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> data indicate that it should be considered as a separate species. It is also differentiated from the mangrove swallow by its lack of a supraloral white line and by its slight difference in size.

A relatively small swallow, the mangrove swallow is long and weighs about . The adult has <a href="iridescence">iridescent</a> blue-green upperparts, white underparts, rump, and <a href="Covert%20feather%23Tail%20coverts">undertail-</a> and <a href="Covert%20feather%23Wing%20coverts">wing-coverts</a>, and blackish tail and flight feathers. The feathers are greener when fresh and bluer when worn. The white underparts sometimes have faint, dark shaft streaks. The <a href="beak">bill</a> is small and black, about long. The iris is a dark brown, and the <a href="bird%20anatomy">tarsus</a> and toes range in colour from black to fuscous-brown. The <a href="lore%20%28anatomy%29%23Ornithology">lores</a> are black and have a thin white line above them. Two other species of "Tachycineta" have this distinctive feature: the <a href="violet-green%20swallow">violet-green swallow</a> and the white-rumped swallow. The adult's tail is only slightly forked. The sexes are similar, although they <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">differ slightly</a> in size. Compared to the male, the female has a slightly longer tail and slightly shorter wings. The juvenile is dull grey-brown above and grey-brown washed white below. Occasionally, the juvenile's upperparts have a subtle, greenish gloss.

The call of the mangrove swallow is a rolled ""jeerrrt"", or a ""chriet"". The song is frequently described as a soft trilling. It uses a short sharp alarm note.

This swallow is native to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and all of <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> (<a href="Belize">Belize</a>, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>, <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> and <a href="Panama">Panama</a>). It is usually found near low-lying bodies of water and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests, which gave rise to the <a href="common%20name">common name</a>. It has also been recorded in <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a>s. In Mexico, it is not typically found above . In Costa Rica, it has been found to occur as high as , but it normally occurs between and sea level. It is rarely found in the highlands. The mangrove swallow is also <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> to the <a href="List%20of%20birds%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States</a>, where it was first recorded in 2002, in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Although the mangrove swallow is a full-time resident of its <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a>, there are probably some post-breeding movements.

The mangrove swallow is closely associated with fairly still, open water, and is often found in small <a href="flock%20%28birds%29">flocks</a> over rivers or lakes when not breeding. Its flight path is normally direct and low over water. It flies with quick wingbeats and some <a href="gliding%20flight">gliding</a>. In between foraging attempts, it can frequently be seen to perch.

The mangrove swallow is a solitary bird; its nests are not found closer than away from each other, and usually have about separating them. The nest itself is built in natural or artificial cavities near water, usually in a tree stump or dead tree. It is also not uncommon for it to nest in <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es. The nest is a few centimetres deep and made with grass, fine stems, moss, and a few leaves and sticks. It is padded with feathers. The nest is normally found to occur below . While the nest is built relatively low, it is still normally above the water level of a typical flood. Sites include tree holes and crevices in rock or bridges.

During its five-month breeding season, the mangrove swallow typically lays two broods. The data suggests that the breeding season is from approximately January to July in Central America, and from around March to June or July in Mexico. Like the related tree swallow, this species is very aggressive to other hirundines when breeding and is very territorial.

This swallow is <a href="Monogamy%23Varieties%20of%20monogamy%20in%20biology">socially monogamous</a>, with some <a href="Extra-pair%20copulation">extra-pair mating</a>. For example, about 15% of nestlings and about 25% of broods are developed through extra-pair paternity. A nest with extra-pair young is, on average, about away from its nearest neighbour. Extra-pair young are also correlated with the <a href="reproductive%20synchrony">breeding synchrony</a> index, or the percentage of females fertile simultaneously. The fact that the laying of eggs is not synchronized within a population is due to the long breeding season of the mangrove swallow. This swallow also displays <a href="Sexual%20conflict%23Sperm%20competition">paternity assurance behaviour</a>. For example, males follow fertile females more often than females follow males. The period of fertility is from six days before the first egg is laid until the second to last egg is laid.

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is three to five white eggs which hatch in 17 days. On average the eggs measure and weigh about . The eggs hatch asynchronously, with about a 60% hatchability. The nestlings are fed by both parents for 23–27 days to <a href="fledge">fledging</a>. Usually, there is only one successful fledgling per nest.

The mangrove swallow subsists primarily on a diet of small, flying <a href="insectivore">insects</a>, including large species such as <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a> and <a href="bee">bee</a>s. The prey it feeds on is large for a bird of its size. This swallow usually feeds close over bays, lakes, and large rivers, but sometimes can be found to forage or more above the water. It normally forages in the early morning and late afternoon, with nestlings being fed just after sunrise and before sunset. Non-breeding mangrove swallows normally forage in small flocks. When breeding although, it feeds alone or in pairs.

The mangrove swallow typically stays within about of its nest when it is foraging for the nestlings. But, when hunting for itself, it has been recorded to go as far out as from its nest. Ordinarily, it will feed within its own territory.

Not much is known about the predators and parasites of the mangrove swallow, although it has been known to lose nests to termites and black flies. The black flies are mainly local and typically only affect artificial nest boxes. The prevalence of the flies is linked to nearby streams and is dependent on weather conditions. This swallow is a host to the parasite "<a href="Sternostoma%20hirundinis">Sternostoma hirundinis</a>", a type of nasal mite.

As of 2016, the mangrove swallow is classified as least concern by the IUCN. There is some evidence that the population is decreasing. This is probably due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a> or the use of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. The justification for classifying this species as of least concern is its large population, estimated to be greater than 500,000 individuals, and its extremely large range, estimated to be about . Although the population is decreasing, it is not decreasing rapidly enough to be classified as a vulnerable species.

Helmut Lent

Helmut Lent (13 June 1918 – 7 October 1944) was a German <a href="night-fighter">night-fighter</a> ace in <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>. Lent shot down 110 aircraft, 102 of them at night. Born into a devoutly religious family, he showed an early passion for <a href="Glider%20aircraft">glider</a> flying; against his father's wishes, he joined the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> in 1936. After completing his training, he was assigned to the 1. Squadron, or "Staffel", of <a href="Zerst%C3%B6rergeschwader%2076">"Zerstörergeschwader" 76</a> (ZG 76), a wing flying the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> twin-engine <a href="heavy%20fighter">heavy fighter</a>. Lent claimed his first aerial victories at the outset of World War II in the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> and over the North Sea. During the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">invasion of Norway</a> he flew ground support missions before he was transferred to the newly established <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%201">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 1</a> (NJG 1), a night-fighter wing.

Lent claimed his first nocturnal victory on 12 May 1941 and on 30 August 1941 was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> for 22 victories. His steady accumulation of aerial victories resulted in regular promotions and awards. On the night of 15 June 1944, "<a href="Major%20%28Germany%29">Major</a>" Lent was the first night fighter pilot to claim 100 nocturnal aerial victories, a feat which earned him the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</a> on 31 July 1944.

On 5 October 1944, Lent flew a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B88">Junkers Ju 88</a> on a routine transit flight from <a href="Stade">Stade</a> to <a href="Borchen">Nordborchen</a>, south of <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a>. On the landing approach one of the engines cut out and the aircraft collided with power lines. All four members of the crew were mortally injured. Three men died shortly after the crash and Lent succumbed to his injuries two days later on 7 October 1944.

Lent was born on 13 June 1918 in Pyrehne, district of <a href="Landsberg%20an%20der%20Warthe">Landsberg an der Warthe</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Brandenburg">Province of Brandenburg</a>, Germany (now <a href="Pyrzany">Pyrzany</a>, <a href="Lubusz%20Province">Lubusz Province</a>, western <a href="Poland">Poland</a>) and christened Helmut Johannes Siegfried Lent. He was the fifth child of Johannes Lent, a <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> minister and Marie Elisabeth, née Braune. Helmut Lent had two older brothers, Werner and Joachim, and two older sisters, Käthe and Ursula. His family was deeply religious; in addition to his father, both of his brothers and both grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers.

From Easter 1924 until Easter 1928, Lent attended the local <a href="Volksschule">public primary school</a> at Pyrehne. His father and oldest brother Werner then tutored him at home in preparation for the entrance examination at the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">public secondary school</a> at Landsberg. In February 1933, Helmut joined the "<a href="Jungvolk">Jungvolk</a>", the junior branch of the <a href="Hitler%20Jugend">Hitler Youth</a>. From March 1933, he acted as a youth platoon leader, or "Jungzugführer" (1 March 1933 – 1 April 1935) and flag-bearer, or "Fähnleinführer" (1 April 1935 – 9 November 1935) until he left the "Jungvolk" to prepare for his "<a href="Abitur">diploma</a>" examination. Helmut passed his graduation examinations at the age of seventeen on 12 December 1935. On 2 February 1936, he began the eight-week compulsory <a href="Reichsarbeitsdienst">National Labor Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst)</a> at <a href="Mohrin">Mohrin</a>. He joined the military service in the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> as a "<a href="Fahnenjunker">Fahnenjunker</a>" on 1 April 1936, against the wishes of his father.

His military training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School ("<a href="RAF%20Gatow">Luftkriegsschule 2</a>") at <a href="Gatow">Gatow</a>, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the <a href="Hitler%20oath">National Socialist oath of allegiance</a> on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a <a href="Heinkel%20He%2072">Heinkel He 72</a> "Kadet" D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%2044">Focke-Wulf Fw 44</a> "Stieglitz". By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent was involved in a road accident, breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to "<a href="F%C3%A4hnrich">Fähnrich</a>". On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to "<a href="Oberf%C3%A4hnrich">Oberfähnrich</a>" (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>". By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.

After leaving Gatow, Helmut Lent was posted to the Heavy Bomber Crew School, or "Große Kampffliegerschule" at <a href="Tutow">Tutow</a>, in northeast Germany. He spent three months training as an observer (1 March 1938 – 30 May 1938). Prior to completing this course, Lent was run over by a car, resulting in a broken lower jaw, concussion, and internal bleeding. On 1 July 1938, Lent was posted to the 3rd Group of <a href="Jagdgeschwader%20132">"Jagdgeschwader" 132</a> "Richthofen" (III./JG 132), flying on 19 July 1938 for the first time after his injuries.

At the beginning of September, Lent's squadron, 7./JG 132, relocated to <a href="Gro%C3%9Fenhain">Großenhain</a> near Dresden, in preparation and support of the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Czechoslovakia%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">annexation of Czechoslovakia</a>. Lent flew a number of operational patrols in this conflict until his "Staffel" relocated again to <a href="Rangsdorf">Rangsdorf</a> on 29 September 1938. After the tension over the occupation of the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudeten</a> territories eased, Lent's unit began a conversion to the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20108">Messerschmitt Bf 108</a> "Taifun". On 1 November 1938 III./JG 132 moved to <a href="F%C3%BCrstenwalde">Fürstenwalde</a>, between Berlin and <a href="Frankfurt/Oder">Frankfurt an der Oder</a>, and was renamed II./JG 141, and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron.

II./JG 141 changed its designation to I./<a href="Zerst%C3%B6rergeschwader%2076">"Zerstörergeschwader" 76</a> (I./ZG 76) on 1 May 1939 at the same time relocating to an airfield at <a href="Olm%C3%BCtz">Olmütz</a>, Czechoslovakia. The group was being re-equipped with the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a>, and Lent made his first flight in the Bf 110 on 7 June 1939. Lent was granted his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate ("Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein"), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 12 May 1939. While converting to the Bf 110, Lent did not have a regular wireless operator ("Funker") in the rear gunner's seat, but on 14 August 1939 he was accompanied in M8+AH for the first time by "<a href="Gefreiter">Gefreiter</a>" <a href="Walter%20Kubisch">Walter Kubisch</a>. During the prelude of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> on 25 August 1939 I./ZG 76 deployed to an airfield at <a href="Ohlau">Ohlau</a> to the southeast of <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>.

World War II began at 04:45 on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces crossed the Polish border. Helmut Lent, flying a Bf 110 marked M8-DH, took off from <a href="Ohlau">Ohlau</a>, at 04:44 to escort <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> bombers on a mission over <a href="Krakow">Krakow</a>.

The German plans for the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> were conceived under the codename <a href="Fall%20Weiss%20%281939%29">"Fall Weiss"</a> (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, the west and the south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and <a href="rear%20gunner">rear gunner</a>, escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./<a href="Kampfgeschwader%204">"Kampfgeschwader" 4</a> (KG 4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack. At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, the second day of the German attack, Lent took off in the direction of <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Łódź</a> and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a <a href="PZL%20P.11">PZL P.11</a>.

At this point of the campaign the Bf 110s switched from bomber escort to ground-attack since the <a href="Polish%20Air%20Force">Polish Air Force</a> was all but defeated. In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin-engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft, a <a href="PZL%20P.24">PZL P.24</a>, on 9 September. On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine. Lent made a forced landing behind German lines. He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign, destroying one anti-aircraft battery. For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded one of the first <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> 2nd Class () of World War II on 21 September 1939. I./ZG 76 relocated to the <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939. From early October to middle December I./ZG 76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to <a href="Jever">Jever</a> on 16 December 1939.

During the first month of the war the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping operations on the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 18 December 1939 in what became to be known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Heligoland%20Bight%20%281939%29">Battle of the Heligoland Bight</a>. Twenty-four twin-engine <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> from <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 9 Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 37 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20149%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 149 Squadron</a> formed up over <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> heading for the island of <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a>. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a <a href="Freya%20radar">Freya radar</a> on the <a href="East%20Frisian%20Islands">East Frisian Islands</a>.

Helmut Lent was ordered to intercept and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at <a href="Jever">Jever</a> from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed. The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed in the shallow sea off <a href="Borkum">Borkum</a>. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum. Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after it had already been badly damaged and was about to crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot <a href="Carl-August%20Schumacher">Carl-August Schumacher</a>.

His success as a fighter pilot over the North Sea had made him a minor national hero. Exploits such as those at Heligoland made good news stories for German propaganda machine. Consequently, he attracted fan mail—mainly from young girls and women—among them Elisabeth Petersen. Lent replied to her letter, and he and Elisabeth met on a <a href="wikt%3Ablind%20date">blind date</a> at the "Reichshof" hotel in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, after which they enjoyed a skiing holiday in <a href="Hirschegg">Hirschegg</a> in February 1940.

On 8 April 1940 eight aircraft of 1./ZG 76, under the command of "<a href="Staffelkapit%C3%A4n">Staffelkapitän</a>" Werner Hansen, deployed northward from Jever to <a href="Westerland%2C%20Germany">Westerland</a> on <a href="Sylt">Sylt</a> in preparation for operation "Weserübung", the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">invasion of Norway</a>. The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital, <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, and six major ports from <a href="Kristiansand">Kristiansand</a> in the south to <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> in the north. Simultaneously, <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2052">Junkers 52</a> (Ju 52) transport aircraft would drop parachute troops to secure Oslo's <a href="Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Fornebu">Fornebu airport</a>. Additional Ju 52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the airfield had to be in German hands. 1./ZG 76 was to provide air cover and ground-attack support for both waves. Eight Bf 110 "Zerstörer" of 1./ZG 76 took off at 7:00 in the morning, planning to synchronize their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one-way operation; the Bf 110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip. Their fuel was calculated to provide them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu, and the pilots would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized.
On the early morning flight to Fornebu, Lent engaged and shot down a Norwegian <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a>. While the Ju 52s transporting the German paratroops came under heavy fire, Lent's "Rotte" engaged the enemy ground positions. Lent's starboard engine caught fire, forcing him to land immediately. With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.

At 18:50 the same day, Lent and his "Staffelkapitän" Werner Hansen took off again from Fornebu in undamaged Bf 110s. During the 40-minute flight, they came across a RAF <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> flying boat, serial number "L2167", from <a href="No.%20210%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 210 Squadron RAF</a> which they shot down together; Hansen received credit for the "kill". Helmut Lent was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class () on 13 May 1940 before he was transferred to <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> on 18 May. He claimed his second aerial victory of the Norwegian campaign on 27 May over a RAF Gloster Gladiator from <a href="No.%20263%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 263 Squadron RAF</a>, piloted by <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> <a href="Caesar%20Hull">Caesar Hull</a>. On 2 June 1940 Lent and his wingman Thönes claimed a Gladiator each. The flight lasted 5 hours and 46 minutes and their opponents were again from No. 263 Squadron, aircraft serial number "N5893" piloted by Pilot Officer J.L. Wilkie, and "N5681" piloted by Pilot Officer L.R. Jacobsen. He claimed his seventh victory overall and final of the Norwegian theatre of operations on 15 June 1940 over a <a href="No.%20254%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 254 Squadron RAF</a> <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a>, piloted by Pilot Officer P.C. Gaylord. On 1 July 1940 Lent was promoted to "<a href="Oberleutnant">Oberleutnant</a>" and on 13 July 1./ZG 76 was relocated to <a href="Stavanger%20Airport%2C%20Forus">Stavanger/Forus</a>.

Helmut Lent briefly participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> when on 15 August 1940 twenty-one Bf 110s from I./ZG 76 escorted He 111 bombers from <a href="Kampfgeschwader%2026">"Kampfgeschwader" 26</a> (KG 26) on their attack on <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and the <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>/<a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> area. I./ZG 76 lost seven aircraft on this mission and it was Helmut Lent's 98th and final mission as a "Zerstörer" pilot.

By June 1940 <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> penetrations of German airspace had increased to the level at which <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> decreed that a <a href="night%20fighter">night-fighter</a> force should be formed. The officer tasked with its creation was <a href="Wolfgang%20Falck">Wolfgang Falck</a>, "Gruppenkommandeur" of the I./<a href="Zerst%C3%B6rergeschwader%201">"Zerstörergeschwader" 1</a> (ZG 1). The night-fighter force began to expand rapidly, with existing units being divided to form the nucleus of new units. By October 1940 <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%201">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 1</a> (NJG 1) comprised three "Gruppen", while <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%202">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 2</a> (NJG 2) and <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%203">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 3</a> (NJG 3), were still forming. It was during this period that Helmut Lent reluctantly became a member of the night-fighter force. At the end of August Lent wrote home, "We are currently converting to night fighting. We are not very enthusiastic. We would sooner head directly for England."

Lent completed night fighter training at <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a> in south-western Germany, and was appointed squadron leader, or "Staffelkapitän", of the newly formed 6./NJG 1 on 1 October 1940. The squadron was based at Fliegerhorst Deelen, located north of <a href="Arnhem">Arnhem</a> in the Netherlands. On the night 11–12 May 1941, Lent claimed his first nocturnal aerial victories against two Wellington IC bombers from <a href="No.%2040%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 40 Squadron RAF</a> on a mission against Hamburg. BL-H (serial number "R1330)" was shot down at 01:40 near <a href="S%C3%BCderstapel">Süderstapel</a> and BL-Z ("R1461") at 02:49 near <a href="Nordstrand%2C%20Germany">Nordstrand</a>.

On 1 July 1941, he took command of 4./NJG 1, stationed in the Netherlands at "Fliegerhorst" (airfield) <a href="Leeuwarden">Leeuwarden</a>, north of Arnheim, on the Friesland coast, where he remained until his death. From this position in the so-called <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, the squadron patrolled the North Sea coast, and could intercept Allied night-time bombing missions, what <a href="Propaganda%20in%20Nazi%20Germany">Nazi propaganda</a> called terror attacks, based out of England. By the end of the war, the 4./NJG 1 was one of the most successful "Nachtjagdstaffel"—a squadron of a night fighter wing—of the Luftwaffe. Other members included such night fighter pilots as "Oberleutnant" <a href="Helmut%20Woltersdorf">Helmut Woltersdorf</a>, "Leutnant" <a href="Ludwig%20Becker%20%28pilot%29">Ludwig Becker</a> (44 victories, KIA February 1943), "Leutnant" <a href="Egmont%20Prinz%20zur%20Lippe-Wei%C3%9Fenfeld">Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld</a> (51 victories, killed in a flying accident in the Netherlands in March 1944), "Leutnant" <a href="Leopold%20Fellerer">Leopold Fellerer</a> (41 victories), "Oberfeldwebel" <a href="Paul%20Gildner">Paul Gildner</a> (46 victories, killed in a flying accident at Fliegerhorst Gilze-Rijen in the Netherlands in February 1943), and "Unteroffizier" Siegfried Ney (12 victories, KIA February 1943). On 30 August 1941, Lent received the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> () for seven daytime and 14 night victories.

On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander "<a href="Gruppenkommandeur">Gruppenkommandeur</a>" of the newly formed II./NJG 2. Lent's first aerial victory as a "Gruppenkommandeur", his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near <a href="Akkrum">Akkrum</a>. The six-man crew of the bomber, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20military%20aircraft%20serials">"X9976"</a> of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron</a>, was killed in action. This achievement earned Lent a reference in the "<a href="Wehrmachtbericht">Wehrmachtbericht</a>" (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the "Wehrmachtbericht" was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.
Lent was promoted to "<a href="Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>" on 1 January 1942. Later that year, he was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves</a> () on 6 June 1942, at which time his total stood at 34 nocturnal victories plus seven day-time victories. The award was presented at the "<a href="F%C3%BChrerhauptquartier">Führerhauptquartier</a>" on 28 and 29 June, his tally standing then at 39 nocturnal and seven day-time victories. Lent also held the distinction of achieving the first <a href="Lichtenstein%20radar">Lichtenstein radar</a>-assisted air victory in a <a href="Dornier%20Do%20215">Dornier Do 215</a>B-5 night fighter. Lent flew Dornier Do 215B-5 code R4+DC regularly on Himmelbett missions because of its five-hour endurance. Lent claimed at least four victories in this machine.

By the end of 1942, Lent had 56 victories and was the top German night-fighter ace. He was promoted to "Major" on 1 January 1943 and appointed "<a href="Geschwaderkommodore">Geschwaderkommodore</a>" of <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%203">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 3</a> (NJG 3) on 1 August 1943. After 73 kills, of which 65 were claimed at night, he was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%20and%20Swords">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords</a> () on 2 August 1943 and notified by telegram on 4 August. The Swords were presented to him at the "Führerhauptquartier" at <a href="Rastenburg">Rastenburg</a> on 10/11 August 1943.

In January 1944, Lent downed three so-called "heavies"—four-engined <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a>s—in one night, but his aircraft was damaged by return fire, requiring a forced landing. He used only 22 cannon shells to down two bombers on the night of the 22–23 March 1944, and fired only 57 rounds in seven minutes against three <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>s on 15–16 June. Promoted to "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>", he was awarded the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20with%20Oak%20Leaves%2C%20Swords%20and%20Diamonds">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds</a> () in recognition of his 110 confirmed air kills, the first of two night-fighter pilots to be awarded the decoration. The second was <a href="Heinz-Wolfgang%20Schnaufer">Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer</a>, who, with 121 aerial victories, became aviation history's leading night-fighter pilot.

All German officers were required to obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, who had been born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in <a href="Wellingsb%C3%BCttel">Wellingsbüttel</a>, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.

Both of Helmut's older brothers, Joachim and Werner, as members of the <a href="Confessing%20Church">Confessing Church</a> (German: "Bekennende Kirche"), encountered trouble with the Nazi Party. The Confessing Church, led by Pastor <a href="Martin%20Niem%C3%B6ller">Martin Niemöller</a>, was a schismatic Protestant church which opposed the Reich's efforts to "Nazify" Germany's Protestant churches. It stood in outspoken opposition to National Socialist principles, particularly those embodied in the <a href="Aryan%20Paragraph">Aryan Paragraph</a>. Through the <a href="Barmen%20Declaration">Barmen Declaration</a>, the church condemned the national <a href="German%20Evangelical%20Church">German Evangelical Church</a> as heretical. Werner Lent, an adherent of the Confessing church, was arrested for the first time in 1937 after preaching an anti-Nazi sermon. In June 1942, his brother Joachim was arrested by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> after reading the so-called <a href="M%C3%B6lders%20letter">Mölders letter</a> from the pulpit. The Mölders letter was a propaganda piece conceived by <a href="Sefton%20Delmer">Sefton Delmer</a>, the chief of the British <a href="black%20propaganda">black propaganda</a> in the <a href="Political%20Warfare%20Executive">Political Warfare Executive</a> (PWE) to capitalize on the death of Germany's fighter ace <a href="Werner%20M%C3%B6lders">Werner Mölders</a>; this letter, ostensibly written by Mölders, attested to the supreme importance of his Catholic faith in his life—by implication, placing faith above his allegiance to the National Socialist Party.

On 5 October 1944, Lent flew his <a href="Junkers%20Ju-88">Junkers Ju-88</a> G–6, coded D5+AA, from <a href="Stade">Stade</a> to <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a>. His crew included his long-time radio operator "<a href="Oberfeldwebel">Oberfeldwebel</a>" <a href="Walter%20Kubisch">Walter Kubisch</a>, the member of a "Propagandakompanie" (<a href="Wehrmacht%20Propaganda%20Troops">Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops</a>) "Leutnant" Werner Kark in the aerial gunner position, and "Oberleutnant" Hermann Klöss, second radio operator. Lent was on his way to visit the "Geschwaderkommodore" of the <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%201">"Nachtjagdgeschwader" 1</a>, "Oberstleutnant" <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Jabs">Hans-Joachim Jabs</a>, to discuss operational matters. Shortly before the arrival at <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a>/<a href="Borchen">Nordborchen</a>, the airfield had come under attack by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>, leaving craters on the runway. An emergency makeshift runway was cleared and marked out for Lent, but an overhead electrical cable was overlooked. During the landing approach, the left engine of the plane failed, causing the wing to dip. Lent was unable to keep the plane steady and it struck high-voltage cables and crashed. All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive. Kubisch and Klöss succumbed to their injuries on the same day, Kark on the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944.

Lent's <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> was held in the <a href="Reich%20Chancellery">Reich Chancellery</a>, Berlin, on Wednesday 11 October 1944. "<a href="Reichsmarschall">Reichsmarschall</a>" <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> took the salute at Lent's coffin, which was draped in the national flag of the Nazi Germany. Ahead of the coffin, carrying Lent's honours and decorations on a velvet cushion, marched "Oberstleutnant" <a href="Werner%20Streib">Werner Streib</a>, the Inspector of Night Fighters. Six steel-helmeted officers, all recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, escorted the coffin on its caisson and stood as <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a> during the ceremony: "Oberstleutnant" <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20Radusch">Günther Radusch</a>, "Oberstleutnant" <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Jabs">Hans-Joachim Jabs</a>, "Major" <a href="Rudolf%20Schoenert">Rudolf Schoenert</a>, "Hauptmann" <a href="Heinz%20Str%C3%BCning">Heinz Strüning</a>, "Hauptmann" Karl Hadeball and "Hauptmann" <a href="Paul%20Zorner">Paul Zorner</a>. On 12 October 1944 Lent and his crew were interred in a single grave in the military cemetery at <a href="Stade">Stade</a>.

A number of Helmut Lent's awards were auctioned at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>, London, on 18 July 1966. The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder for the total sum of £500. The purchaser was <a href="Adolf%20Galland">Adolf Galland</a>, the former "<a href="General%20der%20Jagdflieger">General der Jagdflieger</a>", acting on behalf of the <a href="Federal%20Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Germany%29">West German Ministry of Defence</a>. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter Christina after consultation with her mother, Lena, who was in urgent need for money to pay for an operation. The Federal Ministry of Defence presented the collection to the <a href="Wehrgeschichtliches%20Museum%20Rastatt">Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt</a>, Germany.

In 1964, <a href="Army%20Aviation%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">West German Army Aviation Corps</a> installation in <a href="Rotenburg%20%28W%C3%BCmme%29">Rotenburg (Wümme)</a>, Lower Saxony was named the Lent Barracks, or "Lent-Kaserne", on a recommendation of Lent's former superior. In 2014, the <a href="Bundeswehr">Bundeswehr</a> decided to rename the facility as Lent was no longer considered to be an appropriate namesake. The process, which is expected to finalize in end 2015, involves 1,500 soldiers and 250 civil employees of the site and was initiated by the commander "Oberstleutnant" Edmund Vogel in early 2015. In September 2016 the district administrator Herrmann Luttmann, member of the moderate right-wing Party CDU stated "No substantial evidence has been found that indeed Helmut Lent was a supporter of the Nazi regime". Luttmann will therefore recommend to keep the name to the local government. Lars Klingbeil, member of the Bundestag and of the Defence Committee has signaled that the German armed forced would adhere to the decision made on local level despite all controversies. 
"It's long overdue to rename the last barracks named after Wehrmacht officers," Prof Johannes Tuchel, head of the German Resistance Memorial, told Bild am Sonntag. "Officers like Schulz, Lent and Marseille fought in Hitler's war and were part of Nazi propaganda." The barracks should be renamed after soldiers who resisted the Nazi regime, he said. "Those who fought for human rights and the rule of law cannot be commemorated enough." Historian <a href="Wolfram%20Wette">Wolfram Wette</a> concurs with this, citig the tradition directive of 1982. Historian <a href="S%C3%B6nke%20Neitzel">Sönke Neitzel</a> opines that the Bundeswehr should keep the name of Lent, who was not a Nazi but only a value-oriented person who followed his Christian image of humankind (christlichen Menschenbild), even if no Wehrmacht soldier came out of the war completely clean. Despite this, Neitzel thinks that except the case of Erwin Rommel, in five year no Bundeswehr barracks will retain the name of a Wehrmacht man anymore, since soldiers do not want to risk their careers to defend names unwanted by the Ministry of Defence.

Lent is officially credited with 111 victories in 507 flights. The total includes 103 victories at night, during which he destroyed 59 four-engine bombers and one <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a>, among other types. Lent received a posthumous promotion to "Oberst" (Colonel). Matthews and Foreman, authors of "Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims", researched the <a href="German%20Federal%20Archives">German Federal Archives</a> and found documentation for 111 aerial victory claims, including seven as a "Zerstörer" pilot and 104 as a night fighter pilot, plus three further unconfirmed claims.

The majority of his victories were claimed with detailed geographical locations. However, two of his victories were claimed in a "Planquadrat" (grid reference), for example "QE-PE". The Luftwaffe grid map () was composed of rectangles measuring 15 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">minutes</a> of <a href="latitude">latitude</a> by 30 minutes of <a href="longitude">longitude</a>, an area of about .

Alexander of Lincoln

Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was a medieval English <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, a member of an important administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a>, a <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a> and Chancellor of England under King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, and he was also related to <a href="Nigel%20%28Bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel, Bishop of Ely</a>. Educated at <a href="Laon">Laon</a>, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the <a href="episcopate">episcopate</a>, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.

Although Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up <a href="prebend">prebend</a>s to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a>, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit <a href="Christina%20of%20Markyate">Christina of Markyate</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20of%20Sempringham">Gilbert of Sempringham</a>, founder of the <a href="Gilbertines">Gilbertines</a>.

Alexander was a nephew of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, probably the son of Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral "<a href="Confraternity%20book">libri memoriales</a>", or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was <a href="archdeacon%20of%20Buckingham">archdeacon of Buckingham</a> in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">diocese of Lincoln</a>. Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and <a href="Adelelm%20%28Lord%20High%20Treasurer%29">Adelelm</a>, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son. It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin. Roger's son <a href="Roger%20le%20Poer">Roger le Poer</a>, who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, <a href="Richard%20FitzNeal">Richard FitzNeal</a>, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.

Alexander's birthdate is unknown. Together with his cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the schoolmaster <a href="Anselm%20of%20Laon">Anselm of Laon</a>, and returned to England at some unknown date. The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture. Alexander was an archdeacon in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Salisbury">diocese of Salisbury</a> by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with a writing a glossary of <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> legal terms in the <a href="Old%20Norman">Anglo Norman</a> language, entitled the "Expositiones Vocabulorum". Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander does not appear to have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his elevation to the episcopate in 1123.

Alexander was nominated to the <a href="episcopal%20see">see</a> of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, at a ceremony held in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the <a href="Peterborough%20Chronicle">Peterborough version</a> of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely for the love of Roger.

During his time as bishop Alexander secured the submission of <a href="St%20Albans%20Abbey">St Albans Abbey</a> to his diocese and founded a number of monasteries, including <a href="Haverholme%20Priory">Haverholme Priory</a> (a Gilbertine house), <a href="Dorchester%20on%20Thames">Dorchester on Thames</a> (an <a href="Arrouaisian%20Order">Arrouaisian Order</a> house), <a href="Louth%20Park%20Abbey">Louth Park</a>, and <a href="Thame">Thame</a>; Louth was one of the first <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> houses founded in England, and Dorchester was the refoundation of a former <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a>. During Alexander's episcopate 13 Cistercian abbeys and seven nunneries were founded in his diocese. Alexander himself consecrated the church at Markyate used by the medieval mystic Christina of Markyate and her nuns, and it was he who consecrated her as a hermit at St Albans Abbey. Alexander also founded a hospital for <a href="leper">leper</a>s at Newark-on-Trent.

Although Alexander was a frequent witness to royal charters and documents, there is no evidence that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at <a href="Newark%20Castle%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Newark</a>, <a href="Sleaford%20Castle">Sleaford</a> and <a href="Banbury%20Castle">Banbury</a>, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.

Alexander was probably at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate <a href="John%20of%20Crema">John of Crema</a>, and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He was still in Rome in 1126, and may have helped to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a>, <a href="Abbotsbury%20Abbey">Abbotsbury Abbey</a>, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander had a number of clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were <a href="Ralph%20Gubion">Ralph Gubion</a>, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.

Alexander presided over the organisation of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by <a href="William%20de%20Corbeil">William de Corbeil</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the exact nature of their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.

After Henry's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—<a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a> and his elder brother <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald II, Count of Champagne</a>—and Henry's surviving legitimate child <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>. King Henry's only legitimate son, <a href="William%20Adelin">William</a>, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father, who married her to <a href="Geoffrey%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey, Count of Anjou</a>. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, Earl of Gloucester</a>, an illegitimate son of Henry I.

The election of <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald of Bec</a> to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was announced at the Council of Westminster in 1138. The medieval chronicler <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a> writes that 17 bishops attended the council, which implies that Alexander was present. After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against the family that might incite them to rebel. In early 1139 Stephen may have named <a href="William%20d%27Aubigny%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">William d'Aubigny</a> as <a href="Earl%20of%20Lincoln">Earl of Lincoln</a>, perhaps in an effort to limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.

In June 1139 a knight was killed during a fight in Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men and a group of noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the circumstances of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the "<a href="Gesta%20Stephani">Gesta Stephani</a>", a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.

Since the work of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote in the years before 1154 and who regarded Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian <a href="William%20Stubbs">William Stubbs</a> felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.

After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel defied the king. The bishops' castles refused to surrender to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a>. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently <a href="Excommunication">excommunicated</a> Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a> in 1139 for support in his efforts to recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.

Stephen's brother, <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and one of the king's main supporters, had recently been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention of <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>. Henry called a <a href="legatine%20council">legatine council</a>, a <a href="church%20council">church council</a> convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.

In 1141 Alexander and the citizens of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Gernon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf de Gernon</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>, who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2 February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces. Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England. The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule when she arrived in their city, and drove her away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called <a href="The%20Anarchy">The Anarchy</a>, when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.

Alexander was a supporter of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines, and he was also known as a patron of literature. He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose the "Prophecies of Merlin", which Geoffrey dedicated to him. Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested that Henry write his historical work.

Alexander rebuilt Lincoln Cathedral after it had been destroyed by fire at an unknown date. He had the roof done with stone vaulting and began construction of the west front of the cathedral, which was finished under his successor. The only remaining major traces of Alexander's work on the west end are the carved doors and the frieze on the west front. The author of the "Gesta Stephani" claimed that Alexander's additions made Lincoln Cathedral "more beautiful than before and second to none in the realm". Traditionally, Alexander has been credited with the commissioning of the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of <a href="Tournai%23Geology">Tournai marble</a>. Recent scholarship, however, has cast doubt upon this theory and suggests that the font was carved on the orders of Alexander's successor, <a href="Robert%20de%20Chesney">Robert de Chesney</a>.

Stephen granted to Alexander the land on which the Old Palace of the bishops stands in Lincoln, although it is unclear whether it was Alexander or his successor as bishop who began the construction of the existing building. Stephen's grant added to an earlier one by King Henry, of the Eastgate in Lincoln as an episcopal residence. Work commissioned by Alexander has survived at the three castles he built at Newark-on-Trent, Sleaford, and probably Banbury.

Alexander's nickname, "the Magnificent", reflected his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle. Henry of Huntingdon records that this was a contemporary nickname. Alexander was rebuked by <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> for his lifestyle. He may have been responsible for the education of an illegitimate son of King Henry's, as two charters of Alexander's are witnessed by a William, who is described as a son of the king. He also advanced the careers of his family, naming his relative Adelelm as <a href="Dean%20of%20Lincoln">Dean of Lincoln</a> during his episcopate. Another member of his household was Robert Gubion, who later became abbot of St Albans Abbey.

The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> wrote that Alexander founded a number of monasteries, "to remove the odium" that he had incurred because of his castle building. Alexander himself stated explicitly that his foundation of Louth was intended to secure the remission of his sins, as well as the salvation of King Henry I, his uncle Roger of Salisbury, and his parents. Alexander also played a part in the founding of <a href="Newhouse%20Abbey">Newhouse Abbey</a> in about 1143. Although the actual foundation was by Peter of Goxhill, Alexander and his successor issued confirmation charters and took the new monastery into their protection.

Alexander spent most of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, although some time during that period he was in England as one of the witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by the time of his death the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.

Temperatures Rising

Temperatures Rising is an American television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> that aired on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> network from September 12, 1972 to August 29, 1974. During its 46-episode run, it was presented in three different formats and cast line-ups. The series was developed for the network by <a href="William%20Asher">William Asher</a> and <a href="Harry%20Ackerman">Harry Ackerman</a> for <a href="Ashmont%20Productions">Ashmont Productions</a> and <a href="Screen%20Gems">Screen Gems</a>. Set in a fictional <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> hospital, the series featured <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> as a no-nonsense chief of staff, forced to deal with the outlandish antics of a young intern (<a href="Cleavon%20Little">Cleavon Little</a>) and three nurses (<a href="Joan%20Van%20Ark">Joan Van Ark</a>, <a href="Reva%20Rose">Reva Rose</a>, and Nancy Fox).

For the first season, 26 episodes were produced and broadcast. In the second season, Whitmore was replaced in the lead role by comedian <a href="Paul%20Lynde">Paul Lynde</a>, and Asher was replaced as producer by <a href="E.%20Duke%20Vincent">Duke Vincent</a> and Bruce Johnson. The series was re-titled The New Temperatures Rising Show, and featured a new supporting cast: Sudie Bond, <a href="Barbara%20Cason">Barbara Cason</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Darling">Jennifer Darling</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Morrow">Jeff Morrow</a>, and <a href="John%20Dehner">John Dehner</a>. Cleavon Little was the only returning member of the original cast. In this season, Lynde was presented as the penny-pinching chief of staff, with Bond as his nagging mother and owner of the hospital.

"The New Temperatures Rising Show" ran for 13 episodes before being placed on hiatus in January 1974 due to poor ratings. It returned in July in yet another incarnation. Asher returned as producer and restored the series to its original format—albeit with Lynde continuing in the lead. Reverting to the original title of "Temperatures Rising", Little remained in the show's cast, accompanied by a new line-up of supporting players: <a href="Alice%20Ghostley">Alice Ghostley</a>, Barbara Rucker and, returning from the first season's cast, Nancy Fox. Offered as a <a href="mid-season%20replacement">summer replacement</a> on Thursday nights, the third version of the sitcom ran for seven episodes, after which it was cancelled permanently.

"Temperatures Rising" was one of two sitcoms that the ABC network premiered in its <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1972–73</a> <a href="prime%20time">prime time</a> schedule, the other being "<a href="The%20Paul%20Lynde%20Show">The Paul Lynde Show</a>". Both series were produced and developed by William Asher and his partner Harry Ackerman for Ashmont Productions and Screen Gems, which had scored a major success for the network with "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>", a fantasy sitcom that first aired in 1964 starring Asher's wife, <a href="Elizabeth%20Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a>. Asher and Screen Gems made a deal with ABC to cancel "Bewitched" a year earlier than contracts stipulated, thereby allowing them the opportunity to develop the two new sitcoms. Ackerman served as <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> and Asher as <a href="television%20producer">producer</a>.

Asher and Ackerman derived the format of the series from an unsold <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a> they had produced for ABC in 1965. Entitled "This is a Hospital?", and written by <a href="Sheldon%20Keller">Sheldon Keller</a>, it starred comedian <a href="Shecky%20Greene">Shecky Greene</a> as a mischievous intern who Asher referred to as "<a href="The%20Phil%20Silvers%20Show">Sgt. Bilko</a> in a hospital". Asher also drew on the British "<a href="Carry%20On%20%28franchise%29">Carry On</a>" franchise as his inspiration for "Temperatures Rising".

Set in Capitol General, a fictional Washington, D.C., hospital, the series centered on five characters. Cleavon Little starred as Dr. Jerry Noland, a ghetto-raised intern who works on the side as the hospital <a href="bookmaker">bookie</a> and finds humor in anything from an operation to a con job. Joan Van Ark played Annie Carlisle, the hospital's beautiful, young, sexy head nurse, who is "always covering up for the inept crew". Reva Rose played Nurse Mildred "Millie" MacInerny, who offers satirical comments on the shenanigans going on in the hospital. Nancy Fox was cast as Ellen Turner, a shy student nurse who becomes Noland's most faithful follower. <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> starred as Dr. Vincent Campanelli, the hospital's chief of surgery. Campanelli is presented as an Italian-American former combat surgeon, who looks upon Noland with both pride and shock and refers to the young intern and nurses Carlisle, MacInerny, and Turner as the "<a href="Four%20Horsemen%20of%20the%20Apocalypse">Four Horsemen</a> of Aggravation".

Little's guest appearance on "<a href="All%20in%20the%20Family">All in the Family</a>" led to his casting in "Temperatures Rising", which in turn led to the leading role in the 1974 <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a> comedy film "<a href="Blazing%20Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a>". Little's casting reflected "pressure from the government and Negro organizations and concerned whites who believe that black representation on television was long overdue". William Asher later stated that "Temperatures Rising" gave him a chance to work with a black actor. Fox was cast in "Temperatures Rising" after <a href="Elizabeth%20Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a> spotted her in a commercial for <a href="Close-Up%20%28toothpaste%29">Close-Up</a> toothpaste. Asher had considered her for a part in "<a href="The%20Paul%20Lynde%20Show">The Paul Lynde Show</a>". During the time that "Temperatures Rising" was in production, Fox declined an offer to leave the series and star in another, "<a href="Needles%20and%20Pins%20%28TV%20series%29">Needles and Pins</a>".

In a 2000 interview, William Asher described "Temperatures Rising" as being about: "a young black surgeon who was always into mischief and things, but he was a very competent surgeon. James Whitmore was the head surgeon and he used to drive Whitmore crazy". The pilot episode of "Temperatures Rising" was written by Sheldon Keller, who turned to his "This is a Hospital?" script for inspiration. It features Noland broadcasting a bingo game in code over the hospital's public-address system. <a href="Jack%20Albertson">Jack Albertson</a> guest starred as a United States Senator. Subsequent episodes feature Noland performing a secret operation on a young baseball player while Campanelli deals with a hospital inspector (<a href="Ed%20Platt">Ed Platt</a>), and <a href="John%20Astin">John Astin</a> as a gangster wanting Noland to be his personal physician. In another episode, Noland hypnotizes a patient (<a href="Alice%20Ghostley">Alice Ghostley</a>) and, accidentally, Nurse Turner as well. This nearly costs the hospital a large donation from a potential benefactor (<a href="Charles%20Lane%20%28actor%29">Charles Lane</a>). In later episodes, Campanelli is seen having a brief romance with Nurse Turner's aunt (<a href="Beverly%20Garland">Beverly Garland</a>), Noland helps out a new intern (<a href="Bernie%20Kopell">Bernie Kopell</a>) who has a reputation for being a jinx, and also performs a witchcraft ritual on a patient (<a href="Alan%20Oppenheimer">Alan Oppenheimer</a>) who thinks he has been cursed.

Albertson returned in a later episode that features Dr. Campanelli participating in a documentary film about hospital surgery. Unfortunately, Campanelli develops stage fright during filming. Noland then takes over the operation and receives all the acclaim. Kopell returned to his role as a hospital orderly in two episodes, one in which he causes a furor with a hospital scandal sheet, the other showing Noland having to save him from being fleeced by a patient who is also a <a href="card%20sharp">card shark</a>.

There was some racially tinged comic bantering in the series, such as scenes with Noland giving cotton to a nurse and stating, "Honey, picking cotton is part of my heritage," or observing some adhesive strips labeled "flesh colored" and remarking, "Maybe this is your idea of flesh colored, but it wouldn't make it in my neighborhood." Aside from these, racial issues were avoided, as Asher and Ackerman felt that ABC was not interested in having them mixed into the comedy.

In discussing the series Asher noted:
We too often forget the humanity of doctors and nurses. They become godlike to most of us and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable. We are not doing a drama and have no intention of doing anything like dealing with life and death issues. We want to make people laugh so we de-emphasize the more serious elements of hospital life. It isn't that he [Noland] just sees things differently, he also deals with them differently. That is why Noland will dream up a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.

Production of "Temperatures Rising" was underway by August 1972 with filming done at <a href="Warner%20Bros.%23New%20owners">the Burbank Studios</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>.

In his review of the premiere episode of "Temperatures Rising" for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", critic Don Page felt that <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> was "totally wasted in this silly exercise" and that "guest <a href="Jack%20Albertson">Jack Albertson</a> almost saves it with his portrayal of an annoyed senator. Otherwise, the diagnosis is terminal comedy". Likewise, Cecil Smith, another writer for the "Times", claimed it was the "worst show of the season. Avoid it like the plague".

Other reviews were more favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that "This is the kind of show you don't think you'll laugh at, but you do, mostly because the cast is so good." She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, "marvelous", "pretty", and "funny", and that Nancy Fox "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio editor for the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Press">Pittsburgh Press</a>", noted that "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a hospital and replacing it with comedy. The venture worked well, thanks to excellent performances from the "Temperatures Rising" cast". She praised Albertson, noted that Whitmore "was little seen", and that the series: "is the kind of tidy little show that brings chuckles". Win Fanning, a syndicated columnist, stated that: "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give "Temperatures" a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the "Armored Sentinel" (of <a href="Temple%2C%20Texas">Temple, Texas</a>), stated "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series is a sure pick up!" The reviewer went on to note that "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of <a href="Goldie%20Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a>, but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it."

ABC placed "Temperatures Rising" in its 8:00 PM Tuesday night time-slot, where it debuted on September 12, 1972. Because one of the stars was black, some of ABC's <a href="network%20affiliate">affiliated</a> stations in the southern and midwestern parts of the United States refused to air the series or broadcast it in a different time slot. Airing opposite it were "<a href="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>" on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, and the new sitcom "<a href="Maude%20%28TV%20series%29">Maude</a>" on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>. "Bonanza" was entering its fourteenth year and offered up an ambitious two-hour season premiere dealing with the marriage of <a href="Little%20Joe%20Cartwright">Little Joe Cartwright</a> (<a href="Michael%20Landon">Michael Landon</a>). "Maude", starring <a href="Beatrice%20Arthur">Beatrice Arthur</a> in the title role, was a <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of "<a href="All%20in%20the%20Family">All in the Family</a>". Both shows presented "Temperatures Rising" with stiff opposition in the "<a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings game</a>". The two-hour season premiere of "Bonanza" performed exceptionally well in the ratings. "Maude" did much better than "Temperatures Rising" in the <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> area, while "Temperatures Rising" fared better than "Maude" in the <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> area. In subsequent weeks, "Bonanza"'s ratings dropped sharply and NBC <a href="cancellation%20%28television%29">cancelled</a> the series in November 1972. According to Asher: ""Temperatures Rising" put "Bonanza" out of business and was beating "Maude" in the Los Angeles area until mid-season, when NBC switched to some heavy movies which hurt us". Despite this the series finished its first year with a consistent 29 <a href="share%20%28ratings%29">share of the ratings</a> at a time when a 30 share was enough to assure renewal for another season. ABC, however, wanted to improve the ratings and decided to make significant changes to "Temperatures Rising" for its second season.

As early as November 1972, <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> expressed a desire to leave "Temperatures Rising", claiming that "the show [was] basically a broad <a href="farce">farce</a> and I didn't feel it was right for me". Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC chief programmer <a href="Barry%20Diller">Barry Diller</a> decided to replace Whitmore with comedian Paul Lynde, whose sitcom, "<a href="The%20Paul%20Lynde%20Show">The Paul Lynde Show</a>", was airing on Wednesday nights. At the time, Lynde was scoring second only to <a href="Peter%20Falk">Peter Falk</a> in TV popularity polls even though his sitcom, which aired opposite "<a href="The%20Sonny%20%26amp%3B%20Cher%20Comedy%20Hour">The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour</a>" on CBS, was floundering in the ratings. Asher was against making this change but was overruled as his contractual commitments to ABC had been used up.

Of the change Asher stated:
The network–ugh–they're so stupid sometimes. The shows ["Temperatures Rising" and "The Paul Lynde Show"] were doing good, they weren't big hits, but they were doing good. They felt that if they could put Paul [Lynde] and Cleavon Little together that they would have a big hit. I didn't want to do that. I said I "won't" do it, not at the sacrifice of the show. It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring in somebody else as the head of the hospital. They wanted his [Lynde's] mother to be head of the hospital and his conflicts would be with her and I just didn't think it was right. I didn't want to write it. I just didn't want to do it [and] I didn't. Someone else came in. It was a big thing with the network. They cancelled "The Paul Lynde Show" and put Paul in "Temperatures Rising"."

Asher was replaced as producer by Bruce Johnson and Duke Vincent, whose previous credits included: "<a href="Gomer%20Pyle%2C%20U.S.M.C.">Gomer Pyle – USMC</a>", "<a href="The%20Jim%20Nabors%20Hour">The Jim Nabors Hour</a>", "<a href="Arnie%20%28TV%20series%29">Arnie</a>", and "<a href="The%20Brian%20Keith%20Show">The Little People</a>". They changed the title of the series to "The New Temperatures Rising Show", and the tone went from lighthearted wackiness to a form of <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> similar to "<a href="The%20Hospital">The Hospital</a>", a 1971 film written by <a href="Paddy%20Chayefsky">Paddy Chayefsky</a>, starring <a href="George%20C.%20Scott">George C. Scott</a>. The sitcom became: "a savage satire of the medical profession" with $185-a-day hospital rooms, incompetent, fee-splitting doctors, operations on the wrong patients, misread <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s, and rampant <a href="medical%20malpractice">malpractice</a>. Commenting on the series Vincent noted:

We're not doing stories about a fouled-up hospital. These things really happen. Every story we've told is true. They're the results of untrained people, inadequate staff, horrendous costs, worn-out equipment, the demands of doctors. The doctors, not the patients, are the customers; they're the ones the hospitals have to please ...

For this new season, Johnson and Vincent dropped Joan Van Ark, Reva Rose, and Nancy Fox from the series, leaving Cleavon Little as the only returning cast member. His character, Dr. Jerry Noland, was now being presented as the hospital's only sane figure. Paul Lynde played Dr. Paul Mercy, the sneering, unscrupulous, hospital administrator while Sudie Bond was cast as Martha Mercy, his obnoxious, overbearing mother and the owner, and permanent resident, of the hospital. She constantly calls him with her pager to complain about everything. Also in the new cast were <a href="Barbara%20Cason">Barbara Cason</a> as Miss Tillis, the head of administrative and accounting: "... who would let you bleed to death filling out forms", <a href="Jennifer%20Darling">Jennifer Darling</a> as the romantically inclined nurse "Windy" Winchester, <a href="Jeff%20Morrow">Jeff Morrow</a> as Dr. Lloyd Axton, a fraudulent surgeon who has published two books, "Profit in Healing" and "Malpractice and Its Defense", and <a href="John%20Dehner">John Dehner</a> as "society" Dr. Charles Claver.

For the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1973–74 television season</a> ABC continued to air the revamped "Temperatures Rising" on Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM. CBS continued to air "Maude", and NBC introduced "<a href="Chase%20%281973%20TV%20series%29">Chase</a>", an hour-long crime drama starring <a href="Mitchell%20Ryan">Mitchell Ryan</a>, in the same time slot. Although the season premiere of "Maude" and "Chase" 's debut aired on September 11, 1973, ABC delayed the premiere of "The New Temperatures Rising Show" until September 25.

The episodes produced by Johnson and Vincent included Dr. Mercy exploiting a 125-year-old Civil War veteran and dealing with a strike by the doctors and nurses. Another episode saw Noland create a mythical patient and then claim that the patient died, the cause of death being the result of a lack of cardiac <a href="crash%20cart">crash cart</a>s on each floor of the hospital. Johnson and Vincent's favorite episode was one where the X-rays of a professional footballer are misread, resulting in him being placed by mistake in "Crutchfield's Traction", in which holes are drilled in his head and tongs inserted in them.

In reviewing "The New Temperatures Rising Show", <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> television writer Jay Sharbutt noted:
First the hopeful note: There are faint signs the tinkering with "Temperatures" format could make the series funny later on, but only if the writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.
Likewise, "Los Angeles Times" critic Cecil Smith, who considered the original format "maybe the three worse shows on television rolled into one" now remarked: "Paul Lynde for the first time that I can recall has a part worthy of his mettle. The people surrounding him are first rate."

Despite some heavy promotion the <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> approach was not what audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings</a> for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of "The New Temperatures Rising Show"'s thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered "<a href="Happy%20Days">Happy Days</a>" in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, "... the audience didn't buy that "at all". They just didn't get it. It was funny if you like black comedy, but if you don't it would disturb you. So the show failed miserably and we lost the job and the show."

When John Mitchell and Barry Diller noticed that "The New Temperatures Rising Show" was failing, they contacted William Asher and asked him to salvage the series. According to Asher:
They asked if I'd go back to the old "Temperatures", only this time with Paul [Lynde]. At this point we were still hoping to make it for the midseason. After a couple of weeks we agreed that the show should go off the air in January, but continue production so that we would have 11 shows ready for airing any time they wanted them. Some of the nonsense and hijinks of the first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of the second version. As to why the series was not cancelled, Asher remarked, "I can answer that in two words: Paul Lynde."

For the third format, the show reverted to its original title "Temperatures Rising", and the proposed number of episodes was reduced from eleven to seven. The series' production resumed on November 17, 1973, after a three-week shutdown. Sudie Bond, Barbara Cason, Jennifer Darling, Jeff Morrow, and John Dehner were dropped from the cast and a new line-up was assembled. Paul Lynde continued as Dr. Paul Mercy while <a href="Alice%20Ghostley">Alice Ghostley</a> played Edwina Moffitt, the admissions nurse and Dr. Mercy's sister. She had appeared (in a completely different role) as a guest star in an episode in the first season of "Temperatures Rising". Nancy Fox returned as student nurse Ellen Turner, and Barbara Rucker was introduced as Nurse Amanda Kelly. Cleavon Little returned for a third time as Dr. Jerry Noland, whose character was now being presented as somewhere between the jive-talking surgeon of the first season and the serious one of the second.

"Temperatures Rising" returned to the ABC network on July 18, 1974 after a six-month hiatus. Its new time slot, Thursday nights at 8:00 PM, had previously been occupied by "<a href="Chopper%20One">Chopper One</a>", an adventure series. The situations presented this time around included Dr. Mercy saving the life of a popular country music singer (<a href="Richard%20Gautier">Dick Gautier</a>), and setting up a surveillance system so that staff would be kept on their toes.

The final episode of "Temperatures Rising" aired on August 29, 1974. The attempt to resuscitate the series was unsuccessful, and ABC finally cancelled it permanently. Andy Siegel, a comedy development executive for ABC at the time, felt the series failed because audiences did not want to watch a show displaying inadequate medical care, even though it was done in a humorous fashion. In reminiscing about the series he stated: "When people see doctors on television they really want to feel that they're in good hands. That no matter what happens it is a reassuring experience." William Asher, in a 2000 interview, summed up the demise of the series by saying: "It didn't get on. It's too late. You can't do that to an audience. They won't accept it."

Military history of Australia during World War II

Australia entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> on 3 September 1939, following the government's acceptance of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s declaration of war on <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Following attacks on <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied countries</a>, the Australian government later declared war on other members of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>, including the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> (11 June 1940) and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> (8 December 1941). By the end of the war, almost a million Australians had served in the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">armed forces</a>, whose military units fought primarily in the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European theatre</a>, <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North African campaign</a>, and the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a>. In addition, Australia <a href="Attacks%20on%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">came under direct attack</a> for the first time in its post-colonial history. Its casualties from enemy action during the war were 27,073 killed and 23,477 wounded.

<a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> units were gradually withdrawn from the Mediterranean and Europe following the outbreak of war with Japan. However, <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> units and personnel continued to take part in the war against Germany and Italy. From 1942 until early 1944, Australian forces played a key role in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, making up the majority of Allied strength throughout much of the fighting in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre">South West Pacific theatre</a>. While the military was largely relegated to subsidiary fronts from mid-1944, it continued offensive operations against the Japanese until the war ended.

World War II contributed to major changes in the nation's economy, military and foreign policy. The war accelerated the process of industrialisation, led to the development of a larger peacetime military and began the process with which Australia shifted the focus of its foreign policy from Britain <a href="Australia%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">to the United States</a>. The final effects of the war also contributed to the development of a more diverse and cosmopolitan Australian society.

<a href="Interbellum">Between World War I and World War II</a> Australia suffered greatly from the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> which started in 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure and led to a decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster</a> granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, supporting first the <a href="appeasement%20of%20Hitler">appeasement of Hitler</a> and the British <a href="Anglo-Polish%20military%20alliance">guarantee of Polish independence</a>.

On 3 September 1939, Britain declared war when its ultimatum for Germany to withdraw from Poland expired. Because the "Statute of Westminster" had not yet been ratified by the Australian parliament, any declaration of war by the UK applied to Australia by default. In some other Commonwealth <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s, such as <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, there were intense parliamentary debates before the declaration of war was accepted. Australian <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> asked the British government to notify Germany that Australia was an associate of the United Kingdom. Menzies' support for the war was based on the notion of an imperial defence system, upon which he believed Australia relied and which would be destroyed if the UK was defeated. This position was generally accepted by the Australian public, although there was little enthusiasm for war.

At the time war broke out in Europe, the Australian armed forces were less prepared than at the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914. The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN), the best-prepared of the three services, was small and equipped with only two <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s, four <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, two <a href="Sloop-of-war">sloops</a>, five obsolete <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and a number of small and auxiliary warships. The <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> comprised a small permanent cadre of 3,000 men and 80,000 part-time militiamen who had volunteered for training with the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Military Forces</a> (CMF). The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), the weakest of the services, had 246 aircraft, few of them modern. While the Commonwealth Government began a large <a href="Australia%20and%20the%20Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">military expansion and transferred some RAAF aircrew and units to British control</a> upon the outbreak of war, it was unwilling to immediately dispatch an expeditionary force overseas due to the threat posed by Japanese intervention.

The first Australian shot of the war took place several hours after the declaration of war when a gun at <a href="Fort%20Queenscliff">Fort Queenscliff</a> fired <a href="Warning%20shot">across the bows</a> of an Australian ship that failed to identify itself as it attempted to leave <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> without required clearances. On 10 October 1939 a <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> of <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a>, based in England for re-equipment, became the first Australian and the first <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> air-force unit to go into action when it undertook a mission to <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.
On 15 September 1939 Menzies announced the formation of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF). This <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> initially consisted of 20,000 men organised into an infantry division (the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a>) and auxiliary units. The AIF was institutionally separate from the CMF, which was legally restricted to service in Australia and its external territories, and was formed by raising new units rather than transferring CMF units. On 15 November, Menzies announced the reintroduction of conscription for home-defence service, effective 1 January 1940. Recruitment for the AIF was initially slow, but one in six men of military age had enlisted by March 1940 and a huge surge of volunteers came forward after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">fall of France</a> in June 1940. Men volunteered for the AIF for a range of reasons, with the most common being a sense of duty to defend Australia and the British Empire. In early 1940 each of the services introduced regulations which prohibited the enlistment of people not "substantially of European origin"; while these regulations were strictly enforced by the RAN and Army, the RAAF continued to accept small numbers of non-European Australians.

The AIF's major units were raised between 1939 and 1941. The 6th Division formed during October and November 1939 and embarked for the Middle East in early 1940 to complete its training and to receive modern equipment after the British Government assured the Australian Government that Japan did not pose an immediate threat. The division was intended to join the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> in France when its preparations were complete, but this did not eventuate as Axis forces conquered France before the division was ready. A further three AIF infantry divisions (the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, <a href="8th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">8th Division</a> and <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a>) were raised in the first half of 1940, as well as a <a href="corps">corps</a> headquarters (<a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>) and numerous support and service units. All of these divisions and the majority of the support units deployed overseas during 1940 and 1941. An AIF armoured division (the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Armoured Division</a>) was also raised in early 1941 but never left Australia.

While the Government initially planned to deploy the entire RAAF overseas, it later decided to focus the force's resources on training aircrew to facilitate a massive expansion of Commonwealth air-power. In late 1939 Australia and the other Dominions established the <a href="Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS) to train large numbers of men for service in the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) and in other Commonwealth air units. Almost 28,000 Australians eventually <a href="Australia%20and%20the%20Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">trained through EATS</a> in schools in Australia, Canada and <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>. While many of these men were posted to Australian <a href="Article%20XV%20squadrons">Article XV squadrons</a>, the majority served with British and other Dominion squadrons. Moreover, these nominally "Australian" squadrons did not come under RAAF control and Australians often made up a minority of their airmen. As the Australian Government had no effective control over the deployment of airmen trained through EATS, most Australian historians regard the scheme as having hindered the development of Australia's defence capability. Nevertheless, RAAF airmen trained through EATS represented about nine percent of all aircrew who fought for the RAF in the European and Mediterranean theatres and made an important contribution to Allied operations.

During the first years of World War II, Australia's military strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean and Middle East</a> where they formed a key part of the Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.

The RAN became the first of the Australian services to see action in the Mediterranean theatre. At the time <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Italy%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italy entered the war</a> on 10 June 1940 the RAN had a single cruiser () and the five elderly destroyers of the so-called '<a href="Scrap%20Iron%20Flotilla">Scrap Iron Flotilla</a>' at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> with the British <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a>. During the first days of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mediterranean">Battle of the Mediterranean</a>, "Sydney" sank an Italian destroyer and a submarine. The Mediterranean Fleet maintained a high operational tempo, and on 19 July "Sydney", with a British destroyer squadron in company, engaged the fast Italian light cruisers <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Bartolomeo%20Colleoni">"Bartolomeo Colleoni"</a> and <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Giovanni%20delle%20Bande%20Nere">"Giovanni dalle Bande Nere"</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spada">Battle of Cape Spada</a>. In the running battle which followed, "Bartolomeo Colleoni" was sunk. The Australian ships spent much of their time at sea throughout 1940. "Sydney"'s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, , relieved her in February 1941.

The Australian Army first saw action in <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a>, the successful Commonwealth offensive in North Africa which took place between December 1940 and February 1941. The 6th Division relieved the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29">4th Indian Division</a> on 14 December. Although the 6th Division was not fully equipped, it had completed its training and was given the task of capturing Italian fortresses bypassed by the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 7th Armoured Division</a> during its advance.
The 6th Division went into action at <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> on 3 January 1941. Although a larger Italian force manned the fortress, with the support of British tanks and artillery the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the defensive lines. The majority of the Italian force surrendered on 5 January and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners. The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> on 21 January. Tobruk was secured the next day, with 25,000 Italian prisoners taken. The 6th Division subsequently pushed west along the coast road to <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> and captured <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> on 4 February. The 6th Division withdrew for <a href="Greek%20Campaign">deployment to Greece</a> later in February and was replaced by the untested 9th Division, which took up garrison duties in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>.

In the last week of March 1941, a <a href="Afrika%20Korps">German-led force</a> launched an <a href="Operation%20Sonnenblume">offensive in Cyrenaica</a> which rapidly defeated the Allied forces in the area, forcing a general withdrawal towards Egypt (April 1941). The 9th Division formed the <a href="rear%20guard">rear guard</a> of this withdrawal, and on 6 April was ordered to defend the important port town of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> for at least two months. During the ensuing <a href="siege%20of%20Tobruk">siege of Tobruk</a> the 9th Division, reinforced by the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Brigade</a> of the 7th Division and British artillery and armoured regiments, used fortifications, aggressive patrolling and artillery to contain and defeat repeated German armoured and infantry attacks. The Mediterranean Fleet sustained Tobruk's defenders, and the elderly Australian destroyers made repeated supply "runs" into the port. and were sunk during these operations. Upon the request of the Australian Government, the bulk of the 9th Division was withdrawn from Tobruk in September and October 1941 and was replaced by the <a href="70th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 70th Division</a>. The 2/13th Battalion was forced to remain at Tobruk until the siege was lifted in December when the convoy evacuating it was attacked, however. The defence of Tobruk cost the Australian units involved 3,009 casualties, including 832 killed and 941 taken prisoner.

Two Australian fighter squadrons also took part in the fighting in North Africa. <a href="No.%20239%20Wing%20RAF">No. 239 Wing</a>, a <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">Curtiss P-40</a>-equipped unit in the <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Desert Air Force</a>, was dominated by Australians, in the form of two RAAF squadrons—<a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20450%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 450 Squadron</a>—and numerous individual Australians served in RAF squadrons. These two squadrons differed from the other RAAF squadrons in the Mediterranean in that they were made up of predominantly Australian ground-staff and pilots; the other RAAF units had ground crews made up of mostly British RAF personnel.

In early 1941 the 6th Division and I Corps headquarters took part in the ill-fated Allied <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">expedition to defend Greece</a> from an anticipated German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans compromised the defence of the country.

Australian troops arrived in Greece during March 1941 and manned defensive positions in the north of the country alongside British, New Zealand and Greek units. HMAS "Perth" formed part of the naval force which protected the Allied troop convoys travelling to Greece and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> in late March. The outnumbered Allied force, unable to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April, had to retreat. The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and naval ships evacuated them from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May. Australian warships formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports. The 6th Division suffered heavy casualties in this campaign, with 320 men killed and 2,030 captured.

While most of the 6th Division returned to Egypt, the <a href="19th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">19th Brigade Group</a> and two provisional infantry battalions landed on <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, where they formed a key part of <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete%20order%20of%20battle">the island's defences</a>. The 19th Brigade was initially successful in holding its positions when <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">German paratroopers landed</a> on 20 May, but was gradually forced to retreat. After several key airfields were lost the Allies evacuated the island's garrison. Approximately 3,000 Australians, including the entire <a href="2/7th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/7th Infantry Battalion</a>, could not be evacuated, and were taken prisoner. As a result of its heavy casualties the 6th Division required substantial reinforcements and equipment before it was again ready for combat. "Perth" and the new destroyers and also took part in operations around Crete, with "Perth" embarking soldiers for evacuation to Egypt.
The Allied defeat during the Greek Campaign indirectly contributed to a change of government in Australia. Prime Minister Menzies' <a href="leadership">leadership</a> weakened during the lengthy period he spent in Britain during early 1941, and the high Australian losses in the Greek Campaign led many members of his <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a> (UAP) to conclude that he was not capable of leading the Australian war effort. Menzies resigned on 26 August after losing the confidence of his party and <a href="Arthur%20Fadden">Arthur Fadden</a> from the <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country Party</a> (the UAP's coalition partner) became Prime Minister. Fadden's government collapsed on 3 October, and an <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> government under the leadership of <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> took power.

The 7th Division and the <a href="17th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">17th Brigade</a> from the 6th Division formed a key part of the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign%20order%20of%20battle">Allied ground forces</a> during the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>, fought against <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> forces in June and July 1941. RAAF aircraft also joined the RAF in providing <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>. The Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and <a href="Litani%20River">Litani River</a> valley. Although Allied planners had expected little resistance, the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence and counter-attacks which made good use of the mountainous terrain. After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian I Corps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June.
These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces, and the 7th Division <a href="Battle%20of%20Beirut%20%281941%29">entered Beirut</a> on 12 July. The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July 1941.

In the second half of 1941, the Australian I Corps was concentrated in Syria and Lebanon to rebuild its strength and prepare for further operations in the Middle East. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the Corps, including the 6th and 7th Divisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73 squadrons. The Government did not intend that the 9th Division would play a major role in active fighting, and it was not sent any further reinforcements. All of the RAN's ships in the Mediterranean were also withdrawn to the Pacific but most RAAF units in the Middle East remained in the theatre.

In June 1942, four Australian <a href="J%2C%20K%20and%20N-class%20destroyer">N-class destroyers</a> were transferred to the Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean to participate in <a href="Operation%20Vigorous">Operation Vigorous</a>, which was an attempt to supply the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29">besieged island</a> of <a href="Malta">Malta</a> from Egypt. This operation ended in failure, and had to be scuttled on 16 June after being bombed the previous day. After this operation, the three surviving destroyers returned to the Indian Ocean.

In mid-1942, the Axis forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">defeated the Commonwealth force in Libya</a> and advanced into north-west Egypt. In June, the <a href="British%20Eighth%20Army">British Eighth Army</a> made a stand just over 100 km west of <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Egypt">Alexandria</a>, at the railway siding of <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a> and the 9th Division was brought forward to reinforce this position. The lead elements of the Division arrived at El Alamein on 6 July and the Division was assigned the most northerly section of the Commonwealth defensive line. The 9th Division played a significant role in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a> which halted the Axis advance, though at the cost of heavy casualties, including the entire 2/28th Infantry Battalion which was forced to surrender on 27 July. Following this battle the division remained at the northern end of the El Alamein line and launched diversionary attacks during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a> in early September.

In October 1942, the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in the area took part in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. After a lengthy period of preparation, the Eighth Army launched its major offensive on 23 October. The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle, and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a> to decisively break through the Axis lines on the night of 1/2 November. The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces. During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as it was not possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain it, and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November. The 9th Division <a href="Operation%20Pamphlet">left Egypt for Australia</a> in January 1943, ending the AIF's involvement in the war in North Africa.

Although the Second Battle of El Alamein marked the end of a major Australian role in the Mediterranean, several RAAF units and hundreds of Australians attached to Commonwealth forces remained in the area until the end of the war. After the 9th Division was withdrawn Australia continued to be represented in North Africa by several RAAF squadrons which supported the 8th Army's advance through Libya and the subsequent <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">Tunisia Campaign</a>. Two Australian destroyers ( and ) also participated in <a href="Operation%20Torch">the Allied landings in North Africa</a> in November 1942.
Australia played a small role in the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italian Campaign</a>. The RAN returned to the Mediterranean between May and November 1943 when eight <a href="Bathurst-class%20corvette">"Bathurst" class corvettes</a> were transferred from the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> to the Mediterranean Fleet to protect the invasion force during the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. The corvettes also escorted convoys in the western Mediterranean before returning to the Eastern Fleet. No. 239 Wing and four Australian Article XV squadrons also took part in the Sicilian Campaign, flying from bases in Tunisia, Malta, North Africa and Sicily. No. 239 Wing subsequently provided air support for the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Allied invasion of Italy</a> in September 1943 and moved to the mainland in the middle of that month. The two Australian fighter bomber squadrons provided close air support to the Allied armies and attacked German supply lines until the end of the war. <a href="No.%20454%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 454 Squadron</a> was also deployed to Italy from August 1944 and hundreds of Australians served in RAF units during the campaign.

The RAAF also took part in other Allied operations in the Mediterranean. Two RAAF squadrons, <a href="No.%20451%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 451 Squadron</a> (<a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a>) and <a href="No.%20458%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 458 Squadron</a> (<a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Wellingtons</a>), supported the <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">Allied invasion of southern France</a> in August 1944. No. 451 Squadron was based in southern France in late August and September and when the operation ended both squadrons were moved to Italy, though No. 451 Squadron was transferred to Britain in December. <a href="No.%20459%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 459 Squadron</a> was based in the eastern Mediterranean until the last months of the war in Europe and attacked German targets in Greece and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. In addition, 150 Australians served with the <a href="Balkan%20Air%20Force">Balkan Air Force</a>, principally in <a href="No.%20148%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 148 Squadron RAF</a>. This special duties squadron dropped men and supplies to <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">guerrillas</a> in <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and attempted to supply the Polish <a href="Armia%20Krajowa">Home Army</a> during the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> in 1944.

While the majority of the Australian military fought on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France during World War I, relatively few Australians fought in Europe during World War II. The RAAF, including thousands of Australians posted to British units, made a significant contribution to the strategic bombing of Germany and efforts to safeguard Allied shipping in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>. The other services made smaller contributions, with two Army brigades being briefly based in Britain in late 1940 and several of the RAN's warships serving in the Atlantic.

Australians participated in the defence of Britain throughout the war. More than 100 Australian airmen fought with the RAF during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> in 1940, including <a href="Non-British%20personnel%20in%20the%20RAF%20during%20the%20Battle%20of%20Britain">over 30 fighter pilots</a>. Two AIF brigades (the 18th and <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th</a>) were also <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">stationed in Britain</a> from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings. An Australian Army forestry group served in Britain between 1940 and 1943. Several Australian fighter squadrons were also formed in Britain during 1941 and 1942 and contributed to defending the country from German air raids and, from mid-1944, <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a>s.

The RAAF and RAN took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>. No. 10 Squadron, based in Britain at the outbreak of war to take delivery of its <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> flying boats, remained there throughout the conflict as part of <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a>. It was joined by <a href="No.%20461%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 461 Squadron</a> in April 1942, also equipped with Sunderlands. These squadrons escorted Allied convoys and sank 12 <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. <a href="No.%20455%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 455 Squadron</a> also formed part of Coastal Command from April 1942 as an anti-shipping squadron equipped with light bombers. In this role the squadron made an unusual deployment to <a href="Vaenga%20air%20base">Vaenga air base</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in September 1942 to protect <a href="Convoy%20PQ%2018">Convoy PQ 18</a>. Hundreds of Australian airmen also served in RAF Coastal Command squadrons. In addition to the RAAF's contribution, several of the RAN's cruisers and destroyers escorted shipping in the Atlantic and Caribbean and hundreds of RAN personnel served aboard <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships in the Atlantic throughout the war.

The RAAF's role in the <a href="Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II">strategic air offensive in Europe</a> formed Australia's main contribution to the defeat of Germany. Approximately 13,000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> between 1940 and the end of the war. There was not a distinctive Australian contribution to this campaign, however, as most Australians served in British squadrons and the Australian bomber squadrons were part of RAF units.
The great majority of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons (<a href="No.%20460%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 460</a>, <a href="No.%20462%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 462</a>, <a href="No.%20463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463</a>, <a href="No.%20466%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 466</a> and <a href="No.%20467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467</a> squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, and the proportion of Australians in these units increased over time. <a href="No.%20464%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 464 Squadron</a>, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Second Tactical Air Force</a> in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into <a href="No.%206%20Group%20RCAF">No. 6 Group RCAF</a> in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had little control over how they were used.
Australians took part in all of Bomber Command's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. The Australian contribution to major raids was often substantial, and the Australian squadrons typically provided about 10 percent of the main bomber force during the winter of 1943–44, including during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28RAF%20campaign%29">Battle of Berlin</a>. Overall, the Australian squadrons in Bomber Command dropped 6 percent of the total weight of bombs dropped by the command during the war. Australian aircrew in Bomber Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during World War II. Although only two percent of Australians enlisted in the military served with Bomber Command, they incurred almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat; 3,486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner.

Hundreds of Australians participated in the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">liberation of Western Europe</a> during 1944 and 1945. Ten RAAF squadrons, hundreds of Australians in RAF units and about 500 Australian sailors serving with the Royal Navy <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%20Battle%20of%20Normandy">formed part of the force</a> assembled for the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">landing in Normandy</a> on 6 June 1944; overall, it has been estimated that about 3000 Australian personnel took part in this operation. From 11 June until September 1944 the Spitfire-equipped <a href="No.%20453%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 453 Squadron RAAF</a> was often based at <a href="forward%20airfield">forward airfield</a>s in France and it and Australian light bomber and heavy bomber squadrons supported the liberation of France. RAAF light bomber and fighter squadrons continued to support the Allied armies until the end of the war in Europe by attacking strategic targets and escorting bomber formations. No. 451 and 453 Squadrons formed part of the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of Occupation</a> in Germany from September 1945, and it was planned that there would be a long-term Australian presence in this force. Few RAAF personnel volunteered to remain in Europe, however, and both squadrons were disbanded in January 1946.

In the view of <a href="Paul%20Hasluck">Paul Hasluck</a>, Australia fought two wars between 1939 and 1945: one against Germany and Italy as part of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth and Empire</a> and the other against Japan in alliance with the United States and Britain.

Due to the emphasis placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the <a href="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> Region after 1940. Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as <a href="Pacific%20War">war with Japan</a> loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division, most of which was stationed in Malaya, and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia, including the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Armoured Division</a>. The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft, most of which were obsolete trainers, and the RAN had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters.

In 1942 the Australian military was reinforced by units recalled from the Middle East and an expansion of the CMF and RAAF. United States Military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea. The Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles, but continued to conduct large-scale operations until the end of the war.

From the 1920s Australia's defence planning was dominated by the so-called '<a href="Singapore%20strategy">Singapore strategy</a>'. This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region. To this end, a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased. At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya comprised the 8th Division (less the <a href="23rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">23rd Brigade</a>) under the command of Major General <a href="Gordon%20Bennett%20%28general%29">Gordon Bennett</a>, four RAAF squadrons and eight warships. The RAAF became the first service to see action in the Pacific when Australian aircraft shadowing the Japanese invasion convoy bound for Malaya were fired at on 6 December 1941. Australian units participated in the unsuccessful Commonwealth attempts to defeat the Japanese landings, with RAAF aircraft attacking the <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a>s and accompanying the British battleship and battlecruiser during their <a href="Sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">failed attempt</a> to attack the Japanese invasion fleet.
The 8th Division and its attached <a href="Indian%20Army%20%281858%E2%80%931947%29">Indian Army</a> units were assigned responsibility for the defence of <a href="Johor">Johor</a> in the south of Malaya and did not see action until mid-January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state. The division's first engagement was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Muar">Battle of Muar</a>, in which the <a href="Twenty-Fifth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army</a> was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian <a href="45th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">45th Brigade</a> was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas. While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local victories, they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties. After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese, the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30–31 January.

Following the withdrawal to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed to defend the island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General <a href="Arthur%20Ernest%20Percival">Arthur Ernest Percival</a>, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength <a href="18th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 18th Division</a> to defend this sector. <a href="Battle%20of%20Sarimbun%20Beach">The Japanese landing</a> on 8 February took part in the Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kranji">Japanese landing at Kranji</a> and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972 Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.

While Australia's contribution to the pre-war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore, small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia. The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland. Detachments of <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatchers</a> were also stationed in the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a> and <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> to report on any Japanese operations there.
At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> in <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> was defended by '<a href="Lark%20Force">Lark Force</a>', which comprised the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron. While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military, it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese <a href="South%20Seas%20Force">South Seas Force</a> landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942. The outnumbered Australian force <a href="Battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">was swiftly defeated</a> and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle. Few members of Lark Force survived the war, as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan ("<a href="Montevideo%20Maru">Montevideo Maru</a>") was sunk by the US submarine on 1 July 1942.

AIF troops were also dispatched from Darwin to the <a href="Netherlands%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> (NEI) in the first weeks of the Pacific War. Reinforced battalions from the 23rd Brigade were sent to <a href="Kupang">Koepang</a> in <a href="West%20Timor">West Timor</a> ('<a href="Sparrow%20Force">Sparrow Force</a>') and the island of <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a> ('Gull Force') to defend these strategic locations from Japanese attack. The <a href="2/2nd%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Independent Company</a> was also sent to <a href="Dili">Dili</a> in <a href="Portuguese%20Timor">Portuguese Timor</a> in violation of Portugal's neutrality. The force at Ambon <a href="Battle%20of%20Ambon">was defeated</a> by the Japanese landing on 30 January and surrendered on 3 February 1942. Over 300 Australian prisoners were subsequently killed by Japanese troops in a series of mass executions during February. While the force at Koepang was defeated after the Japanese landed there on 20 February and also surrendered, <a href="Australian%20commandos">Australian commandos</a> waged a <a href="Battle%20of%20Timor">guerrilla campaign</a> against the Japanese in Portuguese Timor until February 1943. "Voyager" and were lost in September and December 1942, respectively, while operating in support of the commandos.
In the lead-up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Java%20%281942%29">Japanese invasion of Java</a> a force of 242 carrier and land-based aircraft <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Darwin%2C%2019%20February%201942">attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942</a>. At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI. The Japanese attack was successful, and resulted in the deaths of 235 military personnel and civilians, many of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen, and heavy damage to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a> and the town's port facilities.

Several Australian warships, a 3,000 strong Army unit and aircraft from several RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March 1942. "Perth" formed part of the main <a href="American-British-Dutch-Australian%20Command">American-British-Dutch-Australian Command</a> (ABDACOM) naval force which was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Java%20Sea">Battle of the Java Sea</a> on 27 February during an attempt to intercept one of the Japanese invasion convoys. "Perth" was sunk on 1 March when she and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sunda%20Strait">encountered</a> another Japanese invasion force while trying to escape to <a href="Tjilatjap">Tjilatjap</a> on the south coast of Java. The sloop was also sunk off the south coast of Java when she was attacked by three Japanese cruisers while escorting a convoy on 4 March. Other Australian warships, including the light cruiser and several corvettes successfully escaped from NEI waters. An army force made up of elements from the 7th Division also formed part of the ABDACOM land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a> on 12 March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate. RAAF aircraft operating from bases in Java and Australia also participated in the fighting, and 160 ground crew from <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron RAAF</a> were taken prisoner.

Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's <a href="1st%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">main aircraft carrier force</a> <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid">raided the Indian Ocean</a>. This force attacked <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> in early April, and "Vampire" was sunk off <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a> on 12 April while escorting , which was also lost. The Australian Army's <a href="16th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">16th</a> and 17th Brigades formed part of the island's garrison at the time of the raid but did not see action.

After the fall of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern aircraft and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to <a href="Burma">Burma</a> while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.
The perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, <a href="Australian%20armoured%20units%20of%20World%20War%20II">three armoured divisions</a> and hundreds of other units. The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths. Due to the increased need for manpower, the restrictions which prohibited non-Europeans from joining the military ceased to be enforced from late 1941, and about 3000 <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> eventually enlisted. Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations, but a small number of racially segregated units such as the <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Light%20Infantry%20Battalion">Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion</a> were formed. A number of small units made up of Indigenous Australians were also established to patrol northern Australia and harass any Japanese forces which landed there; the members of these units did not receive pay or awards for their service until 1992. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining <a href="Auxiliaries">auxiliary</a> organisations such as the <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a> and <a href="Volunteer%20Air%20Observers%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Air Observers Corps</a>, which were modelled on the <a href="British%20Home%20Guard">British Home Guard</a> and <a href="Royal%20Observer%20Corps">Royal Observer Corps</a> respectively. Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain the expanded military after the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 while only 53 of the 73 RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised.

Despite Australian fears, the Japanese <a href="Proposed%20Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">never intended</a> to invade the Australian mainland. While an invasion was considered by the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> in February 1942, it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in New Guinea and the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> and <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> and was postponed indefinitely after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943.
The collapse of British power in the Pacific also led Australia to reorient its foreign and military policy towards the United States. Curtin stated in December 1941 "that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom." In February 1942 the US and British Governments agreed that Australia would become a strategic responsibility of the United States and the Allied <a href="ANZAC%20Force">ANZAC Force</a> was created specifically to defend the Australian continent. In March, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> arrived in Australia after escaping from the Philippines and assumed command of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA). All of the Australian military's combat units in this area were placed under MacArthur's command, and MacArthur replaced the Australian Chiefs of Staff as the Australian Government's main source of military advice until the end of the war. Australian General Thomas Blamey was appointed the Allied land force commander, but MacArthur did not permit him to command American forces. MacArthur also rejected <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">US Army Chief of Staff</a> General <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall's</a> request that he appoint Australians to senior posts in his General Headquarters. Nevertheless, the partnership between Curtin and MacArthur proved beneficial for Australia between 1942 and 1944 as MacArthur was able to communicate Australian requests for assistance to the US Government.

Large numbers of United States military personnel were based in Australia during the first years of the Pacific War. The first US units arrived in Australia in early 1942 and almost 1 million US personnel passed through Australia during the war. Many US military bases were constructed in northern Australia during 1942 and 1943, and Australia remained an important source of supplies to US forces in the Pacific until the end of the war. Though relations between Australians and Americans were generally good, there was some conflict between US and Australian soldiers, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brisbane">Battle of Brisbane</a>, and the Australian Government only reluctantly accepted the presence of <a href="African%20American">African American</a> troops.

Japanese forces first landed on the mainland of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they <a href="invasion%20of%20Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae">invaded Lae and Salamaua</a> to secure bases for the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul. Australian guerrillas from the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Volunteer%20Rifles">New Guinea Volunteer Rifles</a> established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the <a href="2/5th%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/5th Independent Company</a> successfully raided <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a> on 29 June.
After the Battle of the Coral Sea frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Morseby via an amphibious landing, the Japanese attempted to capture the town by landing the South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> and advancing overland using the <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a> to cross the rugged <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a>. The <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a> began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance, opposed by an ill-prepared CMF brigade designated '<a href="Maroubra%20Force">Maroubra Force</a>'. This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force but was unable to halt it. Two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force on 26 August but the Japanese continued to make ground and reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby on 16 September. The South Seas Force was forced to withdraw back along the track on this day, however, as supply problems made any further advance impossible and an Allied counter-landing at Buna was feared. Australian forces pursued the Japanese along the Kokoda Track and forced them into a small <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a> on the north coast of Papua in early November. The Allied operations on the Kokoda Track were made possible by native Papuans who were recruited by the <a href="Australian%20New%20Guinea%20Administrative%20Unit">Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit</a>, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel. The RAAF and USAAF also played an important role throughout the campaign by attacking the Japanese force's supply lines and <a href="airdrop">airdrop</a>ping supplies to Australian Army units.
Australian forces also defeated an attempt to capture the strategic <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> area in August 1942. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a> two brigades of Australian troops, designated Milne Force, supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers defeated a smaller Japanese invasion force made up of <a href="Japanese%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Forces">Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces</a> units. This was the first notable Japanese land defeat and raised Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre.

Australian and US forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua</a> in late November 1942 but did not capture it until January 1943. The Allied force comprised the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 32nd Infantry Division</a> and was short of artillery and supplies. Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred around infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943. Throughout the fighting in Papua, most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered. In response, Australian soldiers aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents for the remainder of the war. The Australians generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel, and some prisoners of war were murdered.
Following the defeats in Papua and <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">Territory of New Guinea</a>. In order to secure their important bases at <a href="Lae">Lae</a> and Salamaua they <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">attempted to capture Wau</a> in January 1943. Reinforcements were flown into the town and defeated the Japanese force in its outskirts following heavy fighting. The Japanese force began to withdraw towards the coast on 4 February. Following their defeat at Wau the Japanese attempted to reinforce Lae in preparation for an expected Allied offensive in the area. This ended in disaster when, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, a troop convoy was destroyed by USAAF and RAAF aircraft from the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">US Fifth Air Force</a> and <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group RAAF</a> with the loss of about 3,000 troops.

The Papuan campaign led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army. During the campaign, the restriction banning CMF personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and CMF. In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> and the <a href="Defence%20%28Citizen%20Military%20Forces%29%20Act%201943">necessary legislation</a> was passed in January 1943. The <a href="11th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">11th Brigade</a> was the only CMF formation to serve outside of Australian territory, however, when it formed part of <a href="Merauke%20Force">Merauke Force</a> in the NEI during 1943 and 1944.

The Japanese efforts to secure New Guinea included a prolonged submarine offensive against the Allied lines of communication between the United States and Australia and Australia and New Guinea. These were not the first Axis naval attacks on Australia; during 1940 and 1941 five German <a href="Armed%20merchantman">surface raiders</a> operated in Australian waters at various times. The German attacks were not successful in disrupting Australian merchant shipping, though "Sydney" was sunk with the loss her entire crew of 645 men in November 1941 in a <a href="Battle%20between%20HMAS%20Sydney%20and%20German%20auxiliary%20cruiser%20Kormoran">battle with the German auxiliary cruiser "Kormoran"</a>, off the coast of Western Australia.

Following the defeat of the Japanese surface fleet the IJN deployed submarines to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast. This campaign began with an unsuccessful <a href="Attack%20on%20Sydney%20Harbour">midget submarine raid on Sydney Harbour</a> on the night of 31 May 1942. Following this attack, Japanese submarines operated along the Australian east coast until August 1942, <a href="List%20of%20ships%20sunk%20by%20Axis%20warships%20in%20Australian%20waters">sinking eight merchant ships</a>. The submarine offensive resumed in January 1943 and continued until June during which time a further 15 ships were sunk off the east coast. The 1943 sinkings included the <a href="AHS%20Centaur">hospital ship "Centaur"</a>, which was torpedoed off Queensland on 14 May with the loss of 268 lives. The Japanese did not conduct further submarine attacks against Australia after June 1943 as their submarines were needed to counter Allied offensives elsewhere in the Pacific. A single German submarine, <a href="German%20submarine%20U-862">"U-862"</a>, operated in the Pacific Ocean during the war, cruising off the Australian coast and New Zealand in December 1944 and January 1945. It sank two ships in Australian waters before returning to <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a>.

Considerable Australian and other Allied military resources were devoted to protecting shipping and ports from Axis submarines and warships. For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100 coastal convoys the Army established <a href="Coastal%20defences%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">coastal defences</a> to protect important ports and a high proportion of the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect shipping at various times. Nevertheless, the use of these units for defensive tasks and the shipping casualties in Australian waters did not seriously affect the Australian economy or Allied war effort.

After halting the Japanese advance, Allied forces went on the offensive across the SWPA from mid 1943. Australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive, which was designated <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>. In particular, General Blamey oversaw a highly successful series of operations around the north-east tip of New Guinea which "was the high point of Australia's experience of operational level command" during the war.
After the successful defence of Wau the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">began advancing towards Salamaua</a> in April 1943. This advance was mounted to divert attention from Lae, which was one of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the <a href="Landing%20at%20Nassau%20Bay">south of Salamaua</a>. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.

In early September 1943 Australian-led forces mounted a <a href="pincer%20movement">pincer movement</a> to capture Lae. On 4 September 9 Division made an amphibious landing to the <a href="Landing%20at%20Lae">east of the town</a> and began advancing to the west. The following day, the <a href="503rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">US 503rd Parachute Regiment</a> made an <a href="Landing%20at%20Nadzab">unopposed parachute drop</a> at Nadzab, just west of Lae. Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae. This race was won by the 7th Division, which captured the town on 15 September. The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign, but were able to escape to the north.
After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">capturing the Huon Peninsula</a>. The <a href="20th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">20th Brigade</a> landed near the strategic harbour of <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a> on 22 September 1943 and secured the area. The Japanese responded by dispatching the <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">20th Division</a> overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter-attack. The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid-October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting. During the second half of November the 9th Division <a href="Battle%20of%20Sattelberg">captured the hills</a> inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces. Following its defeat the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and <a href="4th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">4th Brigade</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Sio">in pursuit</a>. The Allies scored a major intelligence victory towards the end of this campaign when Australian engineers found the 20th Division's entire <a href="cipher">cipher</a> library, which had been buried by the retreating Japanese. These documents led to a <a href="Cryptanalysis">code breaking</a> breakthrough which enabled MacArthur to accelerate the Allied advance by bypassing Japanese defences.
While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland <a href="Finisterre%20Range">Finisterre Range</a>. The <a href="Finisterre%20Range%20campaign">Finisterre Range campaign</a> began on 17 September when the 2/6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley. The company <a href="Battle%20of%20Kaiapit">defeated a larger Japanese force</a> at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly the Division's <a href="21st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">21st</a> and <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th Brigades</a> in. Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key <a href="Battle%20of%20Shaggy%20Ridge">Shaggy Ridge</a> position. The ridge was taken by the end of January, with the RAAF playing a key supporting role. Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from <a href="Landing%20at%20Saidor">Saidor</a> on 21 April and secured <a href="Battle%20of%20Madang">Madang</a> on 24 April.

In addition to supporting the Army's operations on the New Guinea mainland, the RAN and RAAF took part in offensive operations in the Solomon Islands. This involvement had begun in August 1942 when both of the RAN's heavy cruisers, and , supported the US Marine <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">landing at Guadalcanal</a>. On the night after the landing, "Canberra" was sunk during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Battle of Savo Island</a> and the RAN played no further role in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. RAAF aircraft supported several US Army and Marine landings during 1943 and 1944 and a RAAF radar unit participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">capture of Arawe</a>. The Australian cruisers "Australia" and and destroyers and provided fire support for the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 1st Marine Division</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Gloucester">Battle of Cape Gloucester</a> and the <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 1st Cavalry Division</a> during the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">Admiralty Islands campaign</a> in late 1943 and early 1944. The landing at Cape Gloucester was also the first operation for the RAN amphibious transport .

The attack on Darwin in February 1942 marked the start of a prolonged aerial campaign over northern Australia and the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies. Following the first attack on Darwin the Allies rapidly deployed fighter squadrons and reinforced the Army's <a href="Northern%20Territory%20Force">Northern Territory Force</a> to protect the town from a feared invasion. These air units also attacked Japanese positions in the NEI and the Japanese responded by staging dozens of <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Australia%2C%201942%E2%80%9343">air raids on Darwin and nearby airfields</a> during 1942 and 1943, few of which caused significant damage. These raids were opposed by US, Australian and British fighters and suffered increasingly heavy casualties as Darwin's defences were improved. The Japanese also conducted a number of small and ineffective raids on towns and airfields in northern Queensland and Western Australia during 1942 and 1943.

While the Japanese raids on northern Australia ceased in late 1943, the Allied air offensive continued until the end of the war. During late 1942 Allied aircraft conducted attacks on Timor in support of the Australian guerrillas operating there. From early 1943 United States <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> squadrons operated against Japanese targets in the eastern NEI from bases near Darwin. The Allied air offensive against the NEI intensified from June 1943 in order to divert Japanese forces away from New Guinea and the Solomons and involved Australian, Dutch and United States bomber units. These attacks continued until the end of the war, with the US heavy bombers being replaced by Australian <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a>-equipped squadrons in late 1944. From 1944 several RAAF <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a> squadrons were also based at Darwin and conducted highly effective mine-laying sorties across South East Asia.

The Australian military's role in the South-West Pacific decreased during 1944. In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided, with MacArthur's agreement, that the size of the military would be reduced to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and the US forces in the Pacific. Australia's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food, materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan. As a result of this policy, the Army units available for offensive operations were set at six infantry divisions (the three AIF divisions and three CMF divisions) and two armoured brigades. The size of the RAAF was set at 53 squadrons and the RAN was limited to the ships which were in service or planned to be built at the time. In early 1944 all but two of the Army's divisions were withdrawn to the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> in north Queensland for training and rehabilitation. Several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the <a href="Royal%20Pacific%20Islands%20Regiment">Pacific Islands Regiment</a>, however, and largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year. These troops had seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign.
After the liberation of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea%20campaign">Western New Guinea campaign</a>, which had the goal of securing bases to be used to mount the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%931945%29">liberation of the Philippines</a>. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">No. 10 Operational Group RAAF</a> participated in the capture of <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Hollandia</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Biak</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Morotai">Morotai</a>. After western New Guinea was secured No. 10 Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the '<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>' in April 1945.

Elements of the RAN and RAAF also took part in the liberation of the Philippines. Four Australian warships and the assault transports , and "Westralia"—along with a number of smaller warships and support ships—took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">US landing at Leyte</a> on 20 October 1944. Australian sources state that "Australia" became the first Allied ship to be struck by a <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> when she was attacked during this operation on 21 October, though this claim was disputed by US historian <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a>. Australian ships also participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, with "Shropshire" and "Arunta" engaging Japanese ships during the Battle of Surigao Strait on 25 October. The Australian naval force took part in the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Lingayen%20Gulf">Invasion of Lingayen Gulf</a> in January 1945; during this operation "Australia" was struck by a further five Kamikazes which killed 44 of her crew and forced her to withdraw for major repairs. RAN ships also escorted US supply convoys bound for the Philippines. The RAAF's <a href="No.%203%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Airfield Construction Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%201%20Wireless%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Wireless Unit</a> also landed in the Philippines and supported US operations there, and 1TAF raided targets in the southern Philippines from bases in the NEI and New Guinea.

While the Australian Government offered MacArthur I Corps for service in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in the liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations. This was politically embarrassing for the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be employed.

In late 1944, the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and the Aitape-Wewak area in New Guinea. While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions, their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas. The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day. The Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political reasons. It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia's influence in its region. Critics of these campaigns argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective.
The <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a> replaced the <a href="40th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 40th Infantry Division</a> on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the <a href="New%20Britain%20Campaign">New Britain Campaign</a> with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul. In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the <a href="Allied%20Intelligence%20Bureau">Allied Intelligence Bureau</a>. The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the <a href="Gazelle%20Peninsula">Gazelle Peninsula</a> in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas. By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force's aggressive patrolling. The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign. After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong, which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain.
The <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> continued the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a> after it replaced the <a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">US Army's XIV Corps</a> between October and December 1944. The corps consisted of the 3rd Division, 11th Brigade and <a href="Fiji%20Infantry%20Regiment">Fiji Infantry Regiment</a> on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF, <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">RNZAF</a> and USMC air units. While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture, the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville. As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought geographically separated campaigns in the north, centre and southern portions of the island. The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south, and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945. While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war, large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island.

The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for <a href="Aitape-Wewak%20campaign">completing the destruction</a> of the <a href="Japanese%20Eighteenth%20Army">Japanese Eighteenth Army</a>, which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea. The division was reinforced by CMF and armoured units and began arriving at <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a> in October 1944. The 6th Division was also supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships. In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>. The 17th Brigade advanced through the inland <a href="Torricelli%20Mountains">Torricelli Mountains</a> while the remainder of the division moved along the coast. Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease, it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties. The 6th Division's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather. The Australians secured the coastal area by early May, with Wewak being captured on 10 May after a small force was landed to the east of the town. By the end of the war the Eighteenth Army had been forced into what it had designated its 'last stand' area which was under attack from the 6th Division. The Aitape-Wewak campaign cost Australia 442 lives while about 9,000 Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner.

The <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo Campaign of 1945</a> was the last major Allied campaign in the SWPA. In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July, the Australian I Corps, under Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a>, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centred on the <a href="US%207th%20Fleet">US 7th Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="Thomas%20Kinkaid">Thomas Kinkaid</a>, 1TAF and the US <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a> also played important roles in the campaign. The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo's oilfields and <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a> to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led <a href="Operation%20Zipper">liberation of Malaya</a> which were planned to take place later in 1945. The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945, however, and its decision to not release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead.

The campaign opened on 1 May 1945 when the <a href="26th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">26th Brigade Group</a> landed on the small island of <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan</a> off the east coast of Borneo. The goal of this operation was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a> and <a href="Balikpapan">Balikpapan</a>. While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">intensive fighting on the island</a> lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.
The second phase of the Borneo Campaign began on 10 June when the 9th Division <a href="Operation%20Oboe%20Six">conducted simultaneous assaults</a> on the north-west on the island of <a href="Labuan">Labuan</a> and the coast of Brunei. While Brunei was quickly secured, the Japanese garrison on Labuan <a href="Battle%20of%20Labuan">held out for over a week</a>. After the <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a> region was secured the <a href="24th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">24th Brigade</a> was <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">landed in North Borneo</a> and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei. Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance, and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war. During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces.

The third and final stage of the Borneo Campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of the island. This operation had been opposed by General Blamey, who believed that it was unnecessary, but went ahead on the orders of Macarthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July. Balikpapan and its surrounds <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">were secured after some heavy fighting</a> on 21 July but mopping up continued until the end of the war. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War II. Although the Borneo Campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of the lives of soldiers, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.

Australia's leadership changed again during the Borneo Campaign. Prime Minister Curtin suffered a heart attack in November 1944 and <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a> acted in his place until 22 January 1945. Curtin was hospitalised with another bout of illness in April 1945 and <a href="Treasurer%20of%20Australia">Treasurer</a> <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a> became acting Prime Minister as Forde was attending the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Conference">San Francisco Conference</a>. Curtin died on 5 July 1945 and Forde was sworn in as Prime Minister. Forde did not have the support of his party, however, and was replaced by Chifley after a leadership ballot was held on 13 July.

Australia developed large <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20intelligence%20agencies">intelligence services</a> during the war. Prior the outbreak of war the Australian military possessed almost no intelligence gathering facilities and was reliant on information passed on by the British intelligence services. Several small <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> units were established in 1939 and 1940, which had some success intercepting and deciphering Japanese transmissions before the outbreak of the Pacific War.

MacArthur began organising large scale intelligence services shortly after his arrival in Australia. On 15 April 1942, the joint Australian-US <a href="Central%20Bureau">Central Bureau</a> <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> organisation was established at Melbourne. Central Bureau's headquarters moved to Brisbane in July 1942 and <a href="Manila">Manila</a> in May 1945. Australians made up half the strength of Central Bureau, which was expanded to over 4,000 personnel by 1945. The Australian Army and RAAF also provided most of the Allied radio interception capability in the SWPA, and the number of Australian radio interception units was greatly expanded between 1942 and 1945. Central Bureau broke a number of Japanese codes and the intelligence gained from these decryptions and radio <a href="direction%20finding">direction finding</a> greatly assisted Allied forces in the SWPA.
Australian <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> played a significant role in the Pacific War. Following the outbreak of war <a href="Australian%20commandos">commando companies</a> were deployed to Timor, the Solomon and Bismarck islands and New Caledonia. Although the <a href="1st%20Independent%20Company%20%28Australia%29">1st Independent Company</a> was swiftly overwhelmed when the Japanese invaded the Solomon Islands in early 1942, the <a href="2/2nd%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd</a> and <a href="2/4th%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/4th Independent Companies</a> waged a successful guerrilla campaign on Timor which lasted from February 1942 to February 1943 when the Australian force was evacuated. Other commando units also played an important role in the New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and Borneo campaigns throughout the war where they were used to collect intelligence, spearhead offensives and secure the flanks of operations conducted by conventional infantry.

Australia also formed small-scale raiding and reconnaissance forces, most of which were grouped together as the <a href="Allied%20Intelligence%20Bureau">Allied Intelligence Bureau</a>. <a href="Z%20Special%20Unit">Z Special Unit</a> conducted raids far behind the front line, including a successful <a href="Operation%20Jaywick">raid on Singapore in September 1943</a>. <a href="M%20Special%20Unit">M Special Unit</a>, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often used to support Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate tasks such as tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially equipped unit (<a href="No.%20200%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 200 Flight</a>) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.

Australia played a minor role in the <a href="Japan%20campaign">Japan campaign</a> in the last months of the war and was preparing to participate in the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">invasion of Japan</a> at the time the war ended. Several Australian warships operated with the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF) during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a> and Australian destroyers later escorted British aircraft carriers and battleships during attacks on targets in the <a href="Japanese%20archipelago">Japanese home islands</a>. Despite its distance from Japan, Australia was the BPF's main base and a large number of facilities were built to support the fleet.

Australia's participation in the planned invasion of Japan would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces. It was planned to form a new <a href="10th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">10th Division</a> from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Corps">Commonwealth Corps</a> with British, Canadian and New Zealand units. The corps' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps, and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> which was scheduled for March 1946. Australian ships would have operated with the BPF and US Pacific Fleet and two RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and a transport squadron were scheduled to be redeployed from Britain to Okinawa to join the <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Japan">strategic bombardment of Japan</a> as part of <a href="Tiger%20Force%20%28air%29">Tiger Force</a>. Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August 1945 when <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan surrendered</a> following the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>.

General Blamey signed the <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Japanese Instrument of Surrender</a> on behalf of Australia during the ceremony held on board on 2 September 1945. Several RAN warships were <a href="List%20of%20Allied%20ships%20at%20the%20Japanese%20surrender">among the Allied ships</a> anchored in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> during the proceedings. Following the main ceremony on board "Missouri", Japanese field commanders surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre. Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai, several locations in Borneo, Timor, Wewak, Rabaul, Bougainville and Nauru.

In addition to the major deployments, Australian military units and service men and women served in other theatres of the war, typically as part of British-led Commonwealth forces. About 14,000 Australians also served in the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> and crewed ships in many areas of the world.
Australia played a minor role in the British-led campaigns against <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> colonial possessions in Africa. In late September 1940, the heavy cruiser took part in the unsuccessful British and Free French <a href="Battle%20of%20Dakar">attempt to capture Dakar</a> in which she sank a Vichy French destroyer. The Australian Government was not informed of the cruiser's involvement in this operation prior to the battle and complained to the British Government. Three Australian destroyers also took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Madagascar">invasion of Madagascar</a> in September 1942. Closer to home, played a significant role in ensuring that <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> came under <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French</a> control in September 1940 by escorting a pro-Free French Governor to <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a> and taking station off the city during the popular protests which resulted in the Governor replacing the pro-Vichy authorities.

Australian warships served in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> and <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> through much of the war. From June to October 1940 HMAS "Hobart" took part in the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">East African Campaign</a>, and played an important role in the <a href="Italian%20conquest%20of%20British%20Somaliland">successful evacuation</a> of <a href="Berbera">Berbera</a>. In May 1941, "Yarra" supported an operation in which <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a> troops were landed near <a href="Basra">Basra</a> during the <a href="Anglo-Iraqi%20War">Anglo-Iraqi War</a>. In August 1941 "Yarra" and "Kanimbla" took part in the <a href="Anglo-Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Iran">Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran</a>, with "Yarra" sinking the Iranian sloop "Babr" near Kohorramshahr and "Kanimbla" landing troops at Bandar Shapur. A dozen <a href="Bathurst%20class%20corvette">"Bathurst" class corvettes</a> also escorted Allied shipping in the Persian Gulf during 1942.

While most Australian units in the Pacific Theatre fought in the SWPA, hundreds of Australians were posted to British units in Burma and India. These included 45 men from the 8th Division who volunteered to train Chinese guerrillas with the British Mission 204 in southern China and served there from February to September 1942. Hundreds of Australians also served with RAF units in India and Burma, though no RAAF units were deployed to this theatre. In May 1943, some 330 Australians were serving in forty-one squadrons in India, of which only nine had more than ten Australians. In addition, many of the RAN's corvettes and destroyers served with the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> where they were normally used to <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20in%20World%20War%20II">protect convoys in the Indian Ocean</a> from attacks by Japanese and German submarines.

Just under 29,000 Australians were taken <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner</a> by the Axis during the war. Only 14,000 of the 21,467 Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity. The majority of the deaths in captivity were due to malnutrition and disease.

The 8,000 Australians captured by Germany and Italy were generally treated in accordance with the <a href="Geneva%20Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a>. The majority of these men were taken during the fighting in Greece and Crete in 1941, with the next largest group being 1,400 airmen shot down over Europe. Like other western Allied POWs, the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany. As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies. These movements were often made through <a href="The%20March%20%281945%29">forced marches in harsh weather</a> and resulted in many deaths. Four Australians were also executed following a mass escape from <a href="Stalag%20Luft%20III">Stalag Luft III</a> in March 1944. While the Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment.
Like the other Allied personnel captured by the Japanese, most of the thousands of Australians captured in the first months of 1942 during the conquest of Malaya and Singapore, the NEI and New Britain <a href="Japanese%20war%20crimes">were held in harsh conditions</a>. Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in <a href="Hell%20ship">grossly overcrowded ships</a>. While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> and disease, hundreds were deliberately killed by their guards. The <a href="Burma%20Railway">Burma-Thai Railway</a> was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences, as 13,000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese; nearly 2,650 Australians died there. Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they <a href="Aso%20Mining%20forced%20labor%20controversy">worked in factories and mines</a> in generally harsh conditions. The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates; 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived; almost all were killed by overwork and a <a href="Sandakan%20Death%20Marches">series of death marches</a> in 1945.

The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war. Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country's zone of responsibility after the war, and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered <a href="war%20crimes%20trials">war crimes trials</a>.

Thousands of Axis POWs were held in Australia during the war. A total of 25,720 POWs were held in Australia: 18,432 Italians, 5,637 Japanese and 1,651 Germans. These prisoners were housed in <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20prisoner-of-war%20camps%20in%20Australia">purpose-built camps</a> and were treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. A total of 16,798 civilians were also interned. These included 8,921 Australian-resident "<a href="enemy%20alien">enemy alien</a>s", while the remainder were civilians sent to Australia for internment by other Allied countries. On the morning of 5 August 1944, approximately half of the 1,104 Japanese held at a camp near <a href="Cowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cowra, New South Wales</a> <a href="Cowra%20breakout">attempted to escape</a>. The prisoners overwhelmed their guards and over 400 broke through the wire fences; however, every escapee was either recaptured or killed within 10 days.

During the war the Australian Government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both men and women were ordered into essential industries. <a href="Rationing">Rationing</a> was first introduced in 1940 and was greatly expanded during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged <a href="austerity">austerity</a> and <a href="war%20bond">war bond</a>s as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.

Government policies to develop war-related industries were successful in increasing the sophistication of Australia's industrial sector and self-sufficiency in most categories of weapons. In the decades leading up to the war successive Australian governments had provided subsidies, tariffs and other incentives encourage the development of military-related manufacturing sectors such as the production of aircraft, automobiles, electronics and chemicals. These secondary industries were integrated into a <a href="war%20economy">war economy</a> during 1940 and 1941 and were able to meet most of the Army's needs by 1942. Government-led efforts to develop and manufacture advanced technology enjoyed some notable successes, including the development of lightweight <a href="radar">radar</a> sets, optical devices for artillery and equipment adapted for use in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>. Australian industry also developed new weapons which were mass-produced for the military, including the <a href="Owen%20submachine%20gun">Owen submachine gun</a> and a <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025-pounder%20Short">shortened version</a> of the <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025%20pounder">Ordnance QF 25 pounder</a>. In addition, Australian scientists and pharmaceutical companies made important advances in the treatment of <a href="tropical%20disease">tropical disease</a>s. Not all development projects were successful though: efforts to develop an Australian tank (the <a href="Sentinel%20tank">Sentinel</a>) did not cease until after it had been rendered obsolete and unnecessary, and the development of Australian-designed advanced bomber and fighter aircraft (the <a href="CAC%20Woomera">CAC Woomera</a> and <a href="CAC%20CA-15">CAC CA-15</a> respectively) were abandoned as the engines these aircraft required were not available and adequate US and British designs were produced under licence instead.
The massive expansion of the military led to a critical shortage of male workers and increased female participation in the labour force. The number of Australian women in paid employment increased from 644,000 in 1939 to 855,000 in 1944. While this was only a 5 percentage point increase in the proportion of all Australian women who were working, large numbers of women moved from traditionally "female" roles such as domestic servants into "male" roles in industry. <a href="Women%20in%20the%20Australian%20military">Female branches of the armed forces</a> were established in 1941, and by 1944 almost 50,000 women were serving in the <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20Service">Women's Royal Australian Naval Service</a>, <a href="Australian%20Women%27s%20Army%20Service">Australian Women's Army Service</a> and <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a>. Thousands more served with the civilian <a href="Australian%20Women%27s%20Land%20Army">Australian Women's Land Army</a> or undertook voluntary war work. Manpower shortages became an increasingly significant economic issue towards the end of the war, and the Australian military was reduced in size from 1944 to free up personnel for war industries and the civilian economy.

Industrial conscription and the drive to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of <a href="industrial%20unrest">industrial unrest</a> over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and were not able to change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, <a href="Strike%20action">strikes</a> and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.

World War II marked the beginning of a long period of Australian <a href="economic%20growth">economic growth</a>. The war greatly increased the size and importance of the Australian manufacturing sector and stimulated the development of more technologically advanced industries. As part of this trend many workers acquired relatively high skill levels and female labour force participation rates greatly increased. Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.

World War II <a href="Australian%20casualties%20of%20World%20War%20II">cost thousands of Australian lives</a> and consumed a large portion of the national income. During the war, 27,073 members of the Australian military were either killed, died of wounds or died while prisoners of war. Of these, 9,572 were killed in the war against Germany and Italy and 17,501 in the war against Japan. Prisoners of war held by the Japanese made up nearly half of Australia's deaths in the Pacific. At least 386 Australian civilian seamen were killed during the war. Total Australian war expenditure was <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>2,949,380,000 and at its peak in 1942–43, military costs accounted for 40.1 percent of national income.

In the months after the war, Australian authorities were responsible for administering all of Borneo and the NEI east of <a href="Lombok">Lombok</a> until the British and Dutch colonial governments were re-established. While British and Indian forces in the west of the NEI became caught up in the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>, the Australians were able to avoid clashes with local nationalists. Australian forces were also responsible for guarding the 344,000 remaining Japanese in the NEI and Australian territories and administering war crimes trials in these areas. A volunteer force was formed as Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF) in Japan, and Australia provided the BCOF's headquarters and a high proportion of its personnel. This force later formed the nucleus of the post-war Australian Army, which included permanent combat units for the first time.

The Australian military was <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20Australian%20military%20after%20World%20War%20II">rapidly demobilised</a> after the Japanese surrender. At the end of the war the military had a strength of nearly 600,000 personnel, of whom 224,000 were serving in the Pacific and 20,000 in Britain and other places. Demobilisation planning had begun at the end of 1942 with the final scheme being approved by the Government in March 1945. General demobilisation started on 1 October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The process generally ran smoothly, though there were protests over delays at Morotai and Bougainville. Personnel were provided with training while they waited to be demobilised and the government provided post-demobilisation assistance with employment, loans, education and other benefits. Service women were given similar assistance to their male counterparts, but were placed under pressure to return to 'traditional' family roles.

World War II led to significant changes to Australian society. Economically, the war accelerated the development of Australia's manufacturing industry and led to a large fall in unemployment. The impact of World War II changed Australian society, and contributed to the development of a more cosmopolitan society in which women were able to play a larger role. The war also resulted in a greater maturity in Australia's approach to international affairs, as demonstrated by the development of a more independent foreign policy and the encouragement of <a href="Post-war%20immigration%20to%20Australia">mass immigration</a> after the war.

No. 450 Squadron RAAF

No. 450 Squadron was a unit of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) that operated during World War II. Established at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, in February 1941, it was the first Australian <a href="Article%20XV%20squadron">Article XV squadron</a> formed under the <a href="Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>.

The squadron embarked for the Middle East in April 1941; its personnel initially consisted solely of ground crew, who joined the pilots of <a href="No.%20260%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 260 Squadron RAF</a> to form No. 260/450 Squadron, which briefly operated <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters in <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria</a>. It was not until February 1942 that No. 450 Squadron, now with its own pilots and equipped with <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters, commenced operations in earnest. Over the next 15 months, it fought in the <a href="North%20Africa%20Campaign">North African</a> and <a href="Tunisian%20Campaign">Tunisian Campaign</a>s in both <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> and <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a> roles, claiming 49 German and Italian aircraft destroyed in the air and earning the nickname "The Desert Harassers".

Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron took part in the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> and the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italian campaign</a>, primarily in the <a href="Close%20air%20support">close support</a> role. Its aircraft attacked targets in <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a> fighters in May 1945, but never saw action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. Today, by agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> unit, <a href="450%20Tactical%20Helicopter%20Squadron">450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron</a>.

No. 450 Squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a>, near <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle, New South Wales</a>, on 7 February 1941. Raised a week before <a href="No.%20451%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 451 Squadron</a>, it was the first Australian squadron established for service with the British military under the <a href="Article%20XV%20squadron">Article XV</a> of the <a href="Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS). No. 450 Squadron was intended to be an "infiltration" squadron, which would consist initially only of ground crew and would receive a nucleus of experienced pilots after arriving in its designated theatre of operations.

Inaugurated at <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, Canada, in October 1939, EATS was a plan to expand the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s (RAF) capacity to train aircrews by creating a pool of personnel from various Commonwealth countries—Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand—through the establishment of a common training system consisting of a series of initial, elementary, and advanced training schools. At the conclusion of advanced training, personnel were posted as required to RAF-controlled squadrons in Britain or the Middle East. These squadrons were designated as either RAF, RAAF, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> or <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> squadrons, but were paid for and administered by the British government, and personnel could be drawn from any Commonwealth nation. Seventeen RAAF squadrons were formed during the war under Article XV of the agreement.

Under the temporary command of <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> Bruce Shepherd, No. 450 Squadron left Australia on 11 April 1941, embarking on the troopship <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth">"Queen Elizabeth"</a> at Sydney, and arriving in Egypt on 3 May. At <a href="Abu%20Suwayr%20Air%20Base">RAF Abu Sueir</a>, Squadron Leader <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a> took command of the squadron before it was combined with the pilots and <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s of <a href="No.%20260%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 260 Squadron RAF</a>, which had been established without ground crew, to form an operational squadron. The combined unit, known as No. 260/450 (Hurricane) Squadron, then relocated to <a href="Amman">Amman</a> in Transjordan. Its first operation was on 29 June 1941, when the Hurricanes attacked <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> airfields and infrastructure during the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">invasion of Syria</a>. No. 260/450 Squadron operated for ten days only and flew 61 sorties against airfields, 20 on offensive patrols and six on bomber-escort duties during the Syrian campaign.

In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron personnel were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to <a href="Rayak%20Air%20Base">Rayak airfield</a>, Lebanon, where it was allocated Hurricanes and <a href="Miles%20Magister">Miles Magister</a> trainers. A batch of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to <a href="Borg%20El%20Arab%20Airport">Burg El Arab</a>, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, taking part in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>.
By December 1941, the squadron was receiving pilots and it began taking delivery of <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters. On 19 December, RAF Middle East Command issued an administrative instruction declaring that although manned primarily by Australians, Nos. 450 and 451 Squadrons were "paid by and loaned to the Royal Air Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme and for all practical purposes they should be regarded as R.A.F. squadrons in every way". Confusion reigned for a time, but after intervention by the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>, a further communique on 23 January 1942 announced that "450 and 451 E.A.T.S. Squadrons are to be regarded as R.A.A.F. squadrons". Training began the same month, and No. 450 Squadron commenced operations from <a href="RAF%20Gambut">RAF Gambut</a> on 19 February 1942, with an uneventful patrol near <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. Three days later Sergeant Raymond Shaw became the first pilot from the squadron to claim an aerial victory, after he intercepted a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> near <a href="Gazala">Gazala</a>.

The squadron became part of the <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Desert Air Force</a>'s newly formed No. 239 Wing on 1 March 1942, serving alongside one Australian squadron, <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3</a>, and two RAF squadrons, <a href="No.%20112%20Squadron%20RAF">Nos. 112</a> and <a href="No.%20250%20Squadron%20RAF">250 Squadrons</a>. No. 450 Squadron's main roles—escorting daylight raids by <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas Boston</a> bombers, and ground-attack missions in support of the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a>—were hazardous and resulted in relatively heavy losses. From 26 May, as <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a> launched an <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">assault on the Gazala–Bir Hacheim line</a>, all Kittyhawk units began to focus on the <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a> role rather than air-to-air combat, to support retreating Commonwealth forces. On 29 May, No. 450 Squadron claimed two <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a>s and a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>, for the loss of three pilots killed, including Shaw. Flight Sergeant <a href="Don%20McBurnie">Don McBurnie</a>, the squadron's highest-scoring pilot with five solo victories and one shared, claimed his final "kill" on 4 July 1942 when he shot a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> into the sea following a bombing mission on airfields west of <a href="RAF%20El%20Daba">Daba</a>.
No. 450 Squadron took part in the decisive <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>, during October and November 1942, attacking enemy airfields and claiming three German and Italian fighters destroyed in the air. It suffered several losses during this time, including one of its leading scorers, Squadron Leader <a href="John%20Edwin%20Ashley%20Williams">John Williams</a>, who was shot down and taken prisoner on 31 October 1942, three days after he had been appointed commanding officer. The squadron was frequently on the move as the Allies advanced following Second El Alamein, changing locations six times during November. It often found itself using captured or hastily constructed airfields; one Kittyhawk was destroyed and several ground personnel killed or wounded by <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>s at <a href="Marble%20Arch%20%28Libya%29">Marble Arch</a>, Libya, in December 1942.

From late 1942, No. 450 Squadron was engaged in the <a href="Tunisian%20Campaign">Tunisian Campaign</a>. By March 1943, as the Allied forces advanced, the squadron was operating from Medinne along the <a href="Mareth%20Line">Mareth Line</a>. That month it flew over 300 sorties. Further moves occurred, and by mid-April it was based at Karouan. Throughout April and early May, 350 sorties were flown, including attacks on Axis shipping in <a href="Cape%20Bon">Cape Bon</a> and in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tunis">Gulf of Tunis</a>. The campaign came to an end in mid-May, but the squadron continued defensive patrols into June. Between February 1942 and May 1943, it claimed 49 German and Italian aircraft destroyed in aerial combat, for the loss of 31 pilots, four to accidents. As a result of its involvement in the North African fighting, the squadron received the nickname, "The Desert Harassers", and adopted the motto, "Harass", both of which were derived from a comment by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> propaganda broadcaster "<a href="Lord%20Haw%20Haw">Lord Haw Haw</a>", who described the unit as "Australian <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> whose harassing tactics were easily beaten off by the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>"."

Following the conclusion of the fighting in the desert, No. 450 Squadron was allocated a ground-attack role during the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. Moving to Malta on 13 July 1943, the squadron staged out of <a href="RAF%20Luqa">RAF Luqa</a>, and undertook its first attack in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> against Carlentini. Four days later, on 17 July, No. 450 Squadron relocated to Pachino, Sicily, from where it continued ground-attack missions. A further move came on 1 August, when Nos. 450 and 3 Squadrons relocated to Agnone, near <a href="Catania">Catania</a>, where they commenced <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> operations on 11 August, working closely with Allied ground units around <a href="Mount%20Etna">Mount Etna</a>. On the night of 11 August, the airfield was attacked by Ju 88 bombers, which dropped <a href="Incendiary%20ammunition">incendiary</a>, anti-personnel and high-explosive bombs for more than an hour. No. 450 Squadron's personnel had been located some distance from the airfield and only one Australian was wounded, although casualties among other units amounted to twelve killed and 60 wounded. Eighteen RAAF Kittyhawks were destroyed, including eleven belonging to No. 450 Squadron. Despite this, the two RAAF squadrons flew 22 sorties the following day.

During the early stages of the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Allied campaign on the Italian mainland</a>, which commenced in early September 1943, the squadron undertook bomber escort missions in support of the Eighth Army's landings. In the middle of September, it reverted to the close air support role, operating from <a href="Taranto-Grottaglie%20Airport">Grottaglie</a>, although it also undertook anti-shipping operations, including an attack on <a href="Manfredonia">Manfredonia</a> on 21 September, during which its aircraft sunk two vessels. The following month, No. 450 Squadron was transferred to <a href="Foggia">Foggia</a>, and then to Mileni, where it was briefly withdrawn from operations to convert to newer model Kittyhawk IVs before rejoining the campaign in late November. In December, the squadron moved to <a href="Cutella">Cutella</a>, near <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a>, on the central <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast of Italy. There it encountered problems with severe winter weather restricting operations. Cutella airfield was located close to the beach; heavy rains caused a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> on 1 January 1944 and flooded the airfield, damaging some aircraft.
Meanwhile, Williams and another <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> from No. 450 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant Reginald Kierath, were incarcerated with other Allied POWs at "<a href="Stalag%20Luft%20III">Stalag Luft III</a>", in eastern Germany. In March 1944, both took part in "<a href="Stalag%20Luft%20III%23The%20.22Great%20Escape.22The%20Great%20Escape">The Great Escape</a>" and were among 50 POWs murdered by the "<a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>", after being recaptured. Williams, who was 27 years old and from Sydney, was officially an RAF officer, as he had joined the British service under a <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29%23Commissioned%20officers">short service commission</a> in 1938. Kierath, who was 29 and from <a href="Narromine%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Narromine, New South Wales</a>, was an RAAF officer.

Throughout January 1944, No. 450 Squadron undertook anti-shipping operations as well as ground support tasks. It flew missions against targets off <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> and in the harbour at <a href="Sibenik">Sibenik</a>, as well as around the ports of <a href="Velaluka">Velaluka</a> and Zera. In March, the squadron's attention returned to Italy, launching strikes against rolling stock; the following month saw it heavily tasked, flying a total of 430 sorties. On 29 April 1944, a USAAF <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">Republic P-47 Thunderbolt</a> pilot strafed Cutella by mistake. No. 450 Squadron suffered no fatalities or aircraft destroyed but the pilot of a <a href="seaplane">float plane</a> belonging to an <a href="Search%20and%20rescue">air-sea rescue</a> unit was killed, some ground personnel were wounded, a Kittyhawk of No. 3 Squadron was destroyed and several others were damaged. The following month, No. 450 Squadron moved to San Angelo, mounting a series of attacks against a 200-vehicle convoy near <a href="Subiaco%2C%20Lazio">Subiaco</a> in concert with other Kittyhawk squadrons that claimed 123 vehicles destroyed or damaged. No. 450 Squadron later operated from several airfields in central and northern Italy, under the "<a href="Taxicab%20stand">cab rank</a>" system, whereby patrolling fighter-bombers would attack as requested by army <a href="Forward%20air%20control">air liaison officer</a>s. It flew over 1,100 sorties in June and July. The Australian Kittyhawk units were regularly lauded for the accuracy of their assaults; following a mission by No. 450 Squadron on 12 July, the Eighth Army wired No. 239 Wing headquarters: "Excellent bombing. Good show and thank you. No further attacks required."
No. 450 Squadron took part in the major <a href="Gothic%20Line">offensive against the Gothic Line</a> in August–September 1944. Its first attack in early August was a strike on an artillery battery, during which three Kittyhawks were shot down; subsequent attacks throughout the following months were made against various targets including rolling stock, armour, and troop concentrations. From November, after it had moved to Fano on the Italian north-east coast, the squadron also began attacking German forces in <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Its average complement of pilots during the second half of 1944 was 25 from the RAAF, seven from the RAF and five from the <a href="South%20African%20Air%20Force">South African Air Force</a>. No. 450 Squadron commenced operations from <a href="Cervia">Cervia</a> in February 1945; that month, it lost three pilots to prematurely detonating bombs. On 21 March, it took part in <a href="Operation%20Bowler">Operation Bowler</a>, a major air raid on <a href="Venice">Venice</a> harbour. The attack resulted in the sinking of a <a href="merchant%20ship">merchant ship</a>, a torpedo boat, and a coastal steamer, as well as the destruction of five warehouses and other harbour infrastructure.

In May 1945, following the end of the war in Europe, No. 450 Squadron transferred to <a href="Lavariano">Lavariano</a>, a few miles south of <a href="Udine">Udine</a> in north-eastern Italy. It also began replacing its Kittyhawks with <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s. The squadron was disbanded at Lavariano on 20 August 1945. During the war, it had lost 63 personnel killed in action, of whom 49 were Australian.

The squadron was not re-raised by the RAAF after the war, although the numerical designation of "450" was assumed by a Canadian helicopter unit, <a href="450%20Tactical%20Helicopter%20Squadron">450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron</a>, in March 1968. The use of the "450" designation was the result of an administrative error, as the Canadian 400 series squadrons formed during World War II had been numbered between 400 and 449. An agreement was subsequently reached between the RCAF and RAAF and the squadron kept the designation. It is based at <a href="Petawawa">Petawawa</a>, in Ontario, and operates <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook">Boeing CH-47 Chinook</a> helicopters.

Gordon Steege, No. 450 Squadron RAAF's first commanding officer, became patron of the squadron association in April 2008; he died in September 2013, aged 95.

No. 450 Squadron operated the following aircraft:

200 (Stargate SG-1)

"200" is the sixth episode of the science fiction television series "<a href="Stargate%20SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a>"s <a href="Stargate%20SG-1%20%28season%2010%29">tenth season</a>, and the 200th episode of the series overall. Unlike the more serious nature of the season's story arc, "200" is a light-hearted <a href="parody">parody</a> of both "Stargate SG-1" and other <a href="science%20fiction">sci-fi</a> shows, as well as popular culture like "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>".

"200" won the 2007 Constellation Award for "Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script", and was nominated for the 2007 <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation%2C%20Short%20Form">Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form</a>. The episode also marks the first time original SG-1 member <a href="Jack%20O%27Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> (<a href="Richard%20Dean%20Anderson">Richard Dean Anderson</a>) is seen since the beginning of Season 9.

The episode received a 1.9 average household <a href="Ratings%20%28broadcast%29%23Terminology">rating</a>, one of the few episodes of the season that surpassed the average rating of "Stargate SG-1"s <a href="Stargate%20SG-1%20%28season%209%29">previous season</a>. "200" also received near-universal praise for its humor and writing. Despite the strong performance of the episode, the <a href="Syfy">Sci-Fi Channel</a> announced soon after the episode's airing it would not be renewing the series for another season.

Martin Lloyd (<a href="Willie%20Garson">Willie Garson</a>), an <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial</a> turned Hollywood writer, returns to <a href="Stargate%20Command">Stargate Command</a> looking for assistance from <a href="SG-1">SG-1</a> with his script for the movie adaptation of the television show "Wormhole X-Treme", first featured earlier in the series in the episode "<a href="Wormhole%20X-Treme%21%20%28Stargate%20SG-1%29">Wormhole X-Treme!</a>". The team, especially <a href="Cameron%20Mitchell%20%28Stargate%29">Lt. Colonel Mitchell</a> (<a href="Ben%20Browder">Ben Browder</a>), is reluctant to help. Mitchell is excited about his next off-world mission because it marks his 200th trip through the <a href="Stargate%20%28device%29">Stargate</a>. However, when technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission, they are stuck in the briefing room under the orders of <a href="Hank%20Landry%20%28Stargate%29">General Landry</a> (<a href="Beau%20Bridges">Beau Bridges</a>), because the Pentagon believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel will serve as a <a href="disinformation">good cover story</a> to keep the real Stargate program a secret.

The notes session quickly devolves into the team members pitching their own versions of a successful sci-fi film, including a <a href="zombie">zombie</a> invasion (from Mitchell), a previously unseen mission where O'Neill became invisible (from <a href="Samantha%20Carter">Carter</a>), "tributes" to "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wizard of Oz</a>" and "<a href="Farscape">Farscape</a>" (from <a href="Vala%20Mal%20Doran">Vala</a>), and <a href="Teal%27c">Teal'c</a> as a private investigator (from Teal'c himself). Also featured are a vignette of the team's mental image of a "younger and edgier" SG-1 (sparked by the studio's suggestion to replace the original "Wormhole X-Treme" cast), a suggested scene by Martin that turns out to be both scientifically inaccurate and highly derivative of "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", a re-imagined version of the <a href="Children%20of%20the%20Gods">SG-1 pilot episode</a> where all the characters are marionettes in the style of the television series "<a href="Thunderbirds%20%28TV%20series%29">Thunderbirds</a>", and an imagined wedding that features the return of <a href="Jack%20O%27Neill">General O'Neill</a> (<a href="Richard%20Dean%20Anderson">Richard Dean Anderson</a>).

Ultimately, the planning session is all for naught, as the studio decides to cancel the movie in favor of renewing the series. At the end of the episode, the focus shifts ten years into the future, where the "Wormhole X-Treme" cast and crew are celebrating their 200th episode, as well as renewed plans for a movie.

Executive producer <a href="Robert%20C.%20Cooper">Robert C. Cooper</a> originally proposed they write a normal script for the 200th episode. However it soon became clear that deciding who would have the privilege of writing the 200th episode would be problematic. This led to the idea to create a <a href="Sketch%20comedy">sketch</a> episode in the manner of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>", with each writer creating a <a href="vignette%20%28literature%29">vignette</a>. The episode took shape when the writers thought to bring back "Wormhole X-Treme" and the character of Martin, and frame the whole episode as a notes session. By the end of the writing process the episode had turned into "an homage to the cast, crew, and die-hard fans."

"Stargate" producers were not sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was "in" the episode but not actually shown. However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special "Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th" Cooper said, "it was a big deal for us to have [him] back for the 200th episode. We obviously didn't think we could do it without him."

Despite the markedly different content of the episode, "200" took no longer to shoot than a normal episode, mainly because much of the filming took place on the briefing room set. On the other hand, the episode was much more expensive than a typical one, due to the unusual sequences. For example, the <a href="marionette">marionette</a>s used in an elaborate spoof of the series were created by the <a href="The%20Chiodo%20Brothers">Chiodo brothers</a>, who also made the puppets for ""; each puppet cost about US$25,000, and the wires pulling each puppet had to be readded by <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> in post production because they didn't show up well enough. Several existing sets were used as stand-ins; for example, the bridge of the "<a href="Daedalus%20class%20battlecruiser">Odyssey</a>" was used for a "" spoof, while a set from the sister production "" was used as the chamber of <a href="Wizard%20%28Oz%29">the Wizard of Oz</a>.

In an interview about the tenth season of "Stargate", Cooper and series co-creator Brad Wright stated that there was a fine line between the humor of regular episodes turning into <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a>. While jokes for the joke's sake are usually limited in normal episodes, the line between humor and camp is deliberately crossed frequently in "200". The producers even talked about recreating a part of "<a href="Blazing%20Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a>" that breaks the <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a>, but they could not afford the horses.

The producers made sure that the episode was well-publicized, dropping hints that Anderson's character O'Neill would return for the episode. Joe Mallozzi, executive producer for the series, also hinted that series fans would finally meet the <a href="Furling%20%28Stargate%29">Furlings</a>, an enigmatic race referenced in the second-season episode "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Race%20%28Stargate%20SG-1%29">The Fifth Race</a>" but never seen. Despite the outlandish scenes filmed for the episode, many of the writers' favorite moments did not make it to production due to time constraints. For example, Cooper noted that a "<a href="Gilligan%27s%20Island">Gilligan's Island</a>" skit was cut from the script.

Most of the episode is devoted to references and allusions to other works, as well as the show itself. The title sequence is deliberately shorter than most other episodes, poking fun at shows like "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>" as well as the <a href="Syfy">Sci-Fi Channel</a> itself, which had shortened SG-1's Season 9 opening but changed it back after fans demanded it. When Martin learns that his main actor has backed out of the movie, the SG-1 team offers various suggestions for how to replace him or work around his non-availability—a reference to <a href="Michael%20Shanks">Michael Shanks</a>'s absence from the sixth season of "Stargate SG-1". Anderson himself also pokes fun at the ending of the eighth-season episode "<a href="Moebius%20%28Stargate%20SG-1%29">Moebius</a>", which was intended to be the series finale before the ninth season was announced. The final scene of "200", which features interviews with the "Wormhole X-Treme" cast, was added as an afterthought, and contains comments from the real cast which were used out of context as an inside joke.

The episode also riffs on other science fiction shows. Early in the episode, Dr. Jackson asks why anyone would make a movie version of a TV series that lasted only three episodes—Teal'c responds that it had strong DVD sales. This is a reference to the series "<a href="Firefly%20%28TV%20series%29">Firefly</a>", which Fox executives decided to cancel after airing only three episodes (although 14 episodes had been filmed, and 11 of them were actually aired—8 more after the cancellation announcement had been made). The high number of DVDs of these episodes that sold afterwards justified making a feature film based on the series, "<a href="Serenity%20%282005%20film%29">Serenity</a>". ("Firefly" is again referenced when Lloyd refuses to use footage from the "Wormhole X-Treme" series for the movie, saying that "it's a movie, not a clip show." This is an allusion to <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s insistence that the movie "Serenity" would not use footage from the original series because it is "not a <a href="clip%20show">clip show</a>".) In addition, one of the sequences is a parody of the original "Star Trek" series, with SG-1 standing in for the crew of the "<a href="Enterprise%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Enterprise</a>". <a href="Brad%20Wright">Brad Wright</a>, the co-creator of the series, fills in as the engineer <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a>. The episode also pokes good-humored fun at the series "<a href="Farscape">Farscape</a>", including its habit of inventing <a href="profanity">swear words</a>. The "Farscape" sequence itself is an in-joke, since the Stargate: SG-1 actors <a href="Ben%20Browder">Ben Browder</a> and <a href="Claudia%20Black">Claudia Black</a> had both starred in the earlier series (and indeed Black reprises her original role of <a href="List%20of%20Farscape%20characters%23Aeryn%20Sun">Aeryn Sun</a>, though Browder plays a different character, <a href="List%20of%20Farscape%20characters%23Stark">Stark</a>, while Michael Shanks portrays Browder's Farscape character, <a href="List%20of%20Farscape%20characters%23John%20Crichton">John Crichton</a>). Several other shows and movies are parodied, including "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>" (the story is re-told with the members of the SG-1 team as the adventurers in Oz. The writers based the parody on a fan painting they had hanging in their office). The episode also makes fun of "<a href="24%20%28TV%20series%29">24</a>"'s "ticking clock of jeopardy", and an entire sequence is enacted with all the characters played by <a href="marionette">marionette</a>s, in the style of "<a href="Thunderbirds%20%28TV%20series%29">Thunderbirds</a>" and "".

The episode won the 2007 Constellation Award for "Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script", and was nominated for the 2007 <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation%2C%20Short%20Form">Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form</a>. <a href="Richard%20Dean%20Anderson">Richard Dean Anderson</a> also won a <a href="SyFy%20Genre%20Awards">SyFy Genre Award</a> for his guest appearance in the episode.

The episode was generally well received. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> declared the episode "one of the smartest and funniest hours of television to grace the small screen yet this season." They went on to applaud the decision not only to parody other works but the show itself. Maureen Ryan of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" agreed, but also noted that "you don't need to be a longtime fan of the long-running program to enjoy its jibes at sci-fi clichés or expedient writing." "Eclipse Magazine" noted that although the episode was "not a work of comic genius", "200" was the best comedy episode of the series.

The highly publicized debut of the episode garnered a 1.9 average household rating, a 36% jump from the previous episode, and the first episode of the tenth season to reach or exceed the previous season's rating of 1.8; "Stargate SG-1" at that point was averaging about 3.3 million viewers per regular episode in the United States.

Shortly after this episode was aired, <a href="Gateworld">Gateworld</a> announced that the <a href="Syfy">Sci-Fi Channel</a> had decided not renew "Stargate SG-1" for the coming year. The Channel later confirmed this decision, at the same time announcing that "<a href="Stargate%20Atlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a>" had been picked up for another season. Many fans denounced Gateworld's cancellation announcement, both the timing of it (apparently it had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing)—and the decision itself, on the ground that, while ratings were not as high as they had been in previous seasons, the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size. (For example, it had a season average of 2 million viewers in Australia, half of them in the 18–49 demographic.) Sci Fi responded that the cancellation decision had not been based on ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course. Some of the main characters in "SG-1" re-appear later in episodes of "Atlantis" and "Universe" and in the direct-to-DVD sequel films, "" and "".

Dromaeosauroides

Dromaeosauroides is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="dromaeosaurid">dromaeosaurid</a> <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> from the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> of what is now <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. It was discovered in the <a href="Jydegaard%20Formation">Jydegaard Formation</a> in the Robbedale valley, on the island of <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. This is the only likely place for dinosaur remains to be discovered on Danish territory, since the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> deposits exposed in the rest of the country are marine. "Dromaeosauroides" is the first known dinosaur from this location, and the only one which has been scientifically named. It is one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs in the world, and the first known uncontested dromaeosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Europe.

It is known from two teeth, the first of which was found in 2000 and the second in 2008. Based on the first tooth (the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>), the genus and species Dromaeosauroides bornholmensis was named in 2003. The genus name means ""<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus</a>"-like", due to the similarity to the teeth of that genus, and the species name means "from Bornholm". After this discovery, remains and tracks of more dinosaurs were found in several formations on Bornholm. Some teeth from the United Kingdom that have been referred to the genus "<a href="Nuthetes">Nuthetes</a>" may also belong to this animal. <a href="Coprolites">Coprolites</a> containing fish remains found in the Jydegaard Formation may belong to "Dromaeosauroides".

The holotype tooth is long, and the second tooth is . They are curved and finely serrated. In life, "Dromaeosauroides" would have been in length, and weighed about . As a dromaeosaur it would have been feathered, and had a large sickle claw on its feet like its relatives "Dromaeosaurus" and "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>". It lived in a coastal lagoon environment with <a href="sauropods">sauropods</a>, as evidenced by a possible <a href="titanosaur">titanosaur</a> tooth.

Few <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> remains have been found in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. The mainland of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> <a href="chalk">chalk</a>. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including <a href="mosasaurs">mosasaurs</a> and <a href="plesiosaurs">plesiosaurs</a>, have been found in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.

During the 1990s, the Fossil Project (disbanded in 2005) was formed by a group of unemployed people who received funding from Denmark and the <a href="EEC">EEC</a> to maintain geological sites on Bornholm. One of these, "Carl Nielsen's sandpit" in the Robbedale valley (not to be confused with the <a href="Robbedale%20Formation">Robbedale Formation</a>, where no vertebrate remains have been found), is part of the <a href="Jydegaard%20Formation">Jydegaard Formation</a>. This formation is 140 million years old, dating to the <a href="Late%20Berriasian">Late Berriasian</a> (or Ryazanian) stage of the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> period. The Fossil Project sifted sand at these sites in cooperation with the <a href="NaturBornholm">NaturBornholm</a> <a href="interpretation%20centre">interpretation centre</a>, which exhibited the fossils discovered. In September 2000, Danish <a href="palaeontologists">palaeontologists</a> <a href="Per%20Christiansen">Per Christiansen</a> and <a href="Niels%20Bonde">Niels Bonde</a> taught a field course at the site, "The Hunt for Danish Dinosaurs". During the course, geology student Eliza Jarl Estrup found a <a href="theropod">theropod</a> tooth, the first dinosaur discovered on Danish territory, and the find was recorded by a local television station.

The tooth was presented at the 45th annual meeting of the <a href="Palaeontological%20Association">Palaeontological Association</a> in 2001, and identified as a <a href="dromaeosaur">dromaeosaur</a>. In 2003 the tooth (MGUH 27218/DK 315) was made the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of "Dromaeosauroides bornholmensis"—named and described by Christiansen and Bonde. The <a href="genus">genus</a> name combines "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus</a>" with the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ("in the form of"), referring to the resemblance between the teeth of the two genera. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to Bornholm. The name "Dromaeosaurus" itself has been translated as "swift" or "running reptile". Bonde and Christiansen had expected the first Danish dinosaur remains to be teeth of herbivorous dinosaurs such as <a href="hypsilophodonts">hypsilophodonts</a> or "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>", and were surprised to find a dromaeosaur tooth instead, since these are rare in Early Cretaceous formations; herbivores would have been more abundant than carnivores. Because the dromaeosaur seems to have been large, they expected that resilient bones, such as claws, might be found in the future. The palaeontologists did not expect bones of larger dinosaurs to be discovered in the formation (since these would most likely have been found when the sand was commercially exploited), but hoped the remains of a Mesozoic mammal would be found. The holotype tooth has been illustrated in several books and research articles. It was certified ""<a href="Danekr%C3%A6">Danekræ</a>"" ("Danish creature", according to a 1990 Danish museum law securing important fossils) when its scientific importance was evaluated by the <a href="Geological%20Museum%20in%20Copenhagen">Geological Museum in Copenhagen</a>.

In late summer 2008, ranger Jens Kofoed found a second dromaeosaurid tooth. This specimen (DK 559) was found in the same location, and later assigned to "D. bornholmensis" as well. Kofoed explained that the finds were surprising because people had been unsuccessfully searching for dinosaur remains in Denmark for years, and it was like finding a "needle in a haystack". In a press release, the second dromaeosaur tooth was also certified "Danekræ" by the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Denmark">Natural History Museum of Denmark</a>, which compared the animal to the raptors in "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>", noting that the animals, unlike the film's raptors, would have been feathered.

Since the discovery of "Dromaeosauroides", evidence of more dinosaurs has been found on Bornholm. In 2002, a tooth thought to belong to a juvenile <a href="titanosaurian">titanosaurian</a> <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> was found in the Jydegaard Formation. Footprints of a sauropod and a <a href="thyreophoran">thyreophoran</a> were reported from the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> <a href="Bag%C3%A5%20Formation">Bagå Formation</a> in 2005. Small dromaeosaur and indeterminate <a href="maniraptoran">maniraptoran</a> teeth from the Early Cretaceous <a href="Rabekke%20Formation">Rabekke Formation</a> were reported in 2008, and sauropod tracks were also reported from the formation that year. In 2011, footprints of a sauropod, a thyreophoran and a theropod were reported from the Bagå Formation. Lower Jurassic tracks reported form the Rønne Formation on Bornholm in 2014 are the earliest evidence of dinosaur activity in Denmark. A tooth from the <a href="multituberculate">multituberculate</a> "<a href="Sunnyodon">Sunnyodon</a>" was found in the Rabekke Formation in 2004, making it the first known Danish and Scandinavian Mesozoic mammal.

In 2012, Jesper Milàn and colleagues described two <a href="coprolite">coprolite</a>s (fossilised faeces) containing fish scales and bones. They were found in the Jydegaard Formation, the first such fossils found in Danish continental Mesozoic deposits. Although the producer of these faeces cannot be identified with certainty, marine turtles and dromaeosaurids such as "Dromaeosauroides" are the most likely candidates.

Fossil theropod teeth are typically identified according to features including size, proportion, curvature of the crown and the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and number of <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> (serrations). The holotype of "D. bornholmensis" is a <a href="tooth%20crown">tooth crown</a> long, from front to back and wide at the base. The front part of the tooth was worn, indicating that it was shed when the animal was alive. It was further affected by <a href="taphonomic">taphonomic</a> wear; the base of the tooth is irregular, so it may have been slightly longer in life. The curvature and length of the holotype tooth and the length of its hindmost cutting edge (carina) indicates it was in the front of the jaw.

The tooth is recurved with a backward bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its front and back cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04 in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (upper jawbone) and <a href="mandible">mandible</a> of the species "Dromaeosaurus albertensis" from <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to "Dromaeosaurus", and differing from members of the <a href="Velociraptorinae">Velociraptorinae</a> subfamily. "Dromaeosauroides" differs from "Dromaeosaurus" in that the cutting edge at the front side is further from the middle of the tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of "Dromaeosaurus", which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of "Dromaeosauroides"' 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.

The holotype tooth is roughly 25 percent larger than equivalent "Dromaeosaurus" teeth, from which a body length of or more was estimated for "Dromaeosauroides"; it may have been as long as . In an interview, Christiansen estimated its skull to be long and the animal's weight ; a <a href="Bengal%20tiger">Bengal tiger</a> of the same length would weigh by comparison. As a dromaeosaur, "Dromaeosauroides" would have had a large sickle claw on its highly mobile second toe, like its relatives "Dromaeosaurus", "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>" and "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>". That group is closely related to <a href="birds">birds</a>, and the NaturBornholm interpretive centre houses a roughly life-sized sculpture of "Dromaeosauroides" covered in feathers. Later Chinese finds of well-preserved feathered dromaeosaurs indicate that the sculpture should have more and longer feathers to be accurate. Although some smaller dromaeosaurs may have been able to fly, flight was unlikely for an animal the size of "Dromaeosauroides".

Several features of the tooth are only known from members of the family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs. "Dromaeosauroides" was classified as a member of the <a href="Dromaeosaurinae">Dromaeosaurinae</a> <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its similarity to "Dromaeosaurus". Despite the resemblance, "Dromaeosauroides" is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60 million years; "Dromaeosauroides" lived during the Early Cretaceous, and "Dromaeosaurus" during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.

According to Bonde, "Dromaeosauroides" is one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs in the world; older remains, for the most part, have only tentatively been referred to Dromaeosauridae. "Dromaeosauroides" was the first definite dromaeosaurid known from the Early Cretaceous of Europe, depending on the identity of "<a href="Nuthetes">Nuthetes</a>" from the <a href="Middle%20Purbeck">Middle Purbeck</a> formation of the United Kingdom (which may slightly predate the Jydegaard Formation). It is uncertain whether the juvenile holotype specimen of "Nuthetes" has dromaeosaurid characteristics. Large specimens referred to "Nuthetes" appear to belong to true dromaeosaurs, and may belong to "Dromaeosauroides" rather than "Nuthetes". These specimens measure . 

"Dromaeosauroides" has been considered an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth differ from those of other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including "Dromaeosaurus"), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa. The German palaeontologist Oliver W. M. Rauhut and colleagues cautioned in 2010 that theropod teeth from the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous similar to those of dromaeosaurids may instead have belonged to the small <a href="tyrannosauroid">tyrannosauroid</a> "<a href="Proceratosaurus">Proceratosaurus</a>" or related taxa.

Only a corner of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today; the remainder is overgrown. Jydegaard is part of the <a href="Nyker%20Group">Nyker Group</a>, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the <a href="Valanginian">Valanginian</a> ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> facing a coastal strip. In addition to "Dromaeosauroides" and a possible titanosaur, remains of <a href="hybodont%20sharks">hybodont sharks</a>, fish such as "<a href="Lepidotes">Lepidotes</a>" and "<a href="Pleuropholis">Pleuropholis</a>", turtles, lizards, the <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a> "<a href="Pholidosaurus">Pholidosaurus</a>" and thin bone fragments from birds or <a href="pterosaurs">pterosaurs</a> have been found in the deposit. The bivalve "<a href="Neomiodon">Neomiodon</a>" is found in abundance in the sediments below (the "Neomiodon" Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a> toxins.

The fish and bivalves were found in clay which was probably a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay that may have been shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy barrier between lagoon and sea, in a setting perhaps similar to the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a> or the southwestern coast of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.

Based on possible dromaeosaur coprolites from the Jydegaard Formation, which contained scales of the fish "Lepidotes", Milàn and colleagues speculated that some dromaeosaurids were able to catch fish with the enlarged sickle claw on the second digit of the foot, similar to the "spear fishing" that has been proposed for the theropod "<a href="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a>" and its enlarged thumb claw. The larger of the two coprolites has evidence of <a href="coprophagous">coprophagous</a> organisms.

Royal Gloucestershire Hussars

The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was a <a href="British%20Volunteer%20Corps">volunteer</a> <a href="yeomanry">yeomanry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> which, in the 20th century, became part of the British <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Army Reserve</a>. It traced its origins to the First or <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> Troop of Gloucestershire Gentleman and Yeomanry raised in 1795, although a break in the lineage means that its formation is dated to the <a href="Marshfield%2C%20Gloucestershire">Marshfield</a> and <a href="Dodington%2C%20Gloucestershire">Dodington</a> Troop raised in 1830. Six further <a href="troop">troop</a>s – officered by <a href="nobility">nobility</a> and <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, and recruited largely from among <a href="Land%20tenure">landholders</a> and <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s – were subsequently raised in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, and in 1834 they came together to form the Gloucestershire Yeomanry Cavalry. In 1847, the regiment adopted a <a href="hussar">hussar</a> uniform and the name Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. Originally intended to counter insurrection and a <a href="Napoleon%27s%20planned%20invasion%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">French invasion</a> that never materialised, the yeomanry's first deployments were ceremonial and as mounted police during times of civil unrest. Three Gloucestershire troops were deployed to Bristol on two separate occasions in the 1830s in support of the civil authorities.

From the mid-19th century, the yeomanry's policing role diminished with the establishment of a <a href="History%20of%20law%20enforcement%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">civilian police force</a>, and renewed fears of invasion turned its focus to national defence. The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars' first <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a> was won in South Africa during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, when a contingent of Gloucestershire yeomanry served as mounted infantry in the <a href="Imperial%20Yeomanry">Imperial Yeomanry</a>. Before the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, all volunteer forces, including the yeomanry, were brought into the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>. On the outbreak of the war the regiment raised a second-line unit, which remained in the UK and became a cyclist unit in 1916, and a third-line unit, which served as a reserve. The first-line unit saw action as infantry at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> and as cavalry in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>; in the latter it fought both mounted and dismounted from the Suez Canal to Aleppo in modern day Syria. Following the war, the regiment was downsized and converted to the 21st (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Armoured Car Company.

When the United Kingdom began mobilising again in the late 1930s, the company converted to an armoured regiment and was restored to its former name. On the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars once again raised second- and third-line units. The first-line regiment remained in the UK as a training unit, seeing service overseas only after the war as part of the army of occupation in Austria, and the third-line regiment was actually a troop-sized unit acting mainly as a deception designed to disguise British armour strength and disposition. The 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars fought in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a>, initially attached to the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured Division</a> (the "Desert Rats"). The regiment suffered heavy losses during <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a> and the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>, twice being taken out of the line for refit, and was variously equipped with <a href="Crusader%20tank">Crusader</a>, <a href="M3%20Stuart">M3 Stuart</a> and <a href="M3%20Lee">M3 Grant</a> tanks. When it lost two commanders killed in action in quick succession, the regiment's individual squadrons were used to reinforce other units, and the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was disbanded in 1943. Reduced back to a single regiment after the war, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was equipped with armoured cars and given a reconnaissance role. Repeated reorganisation of the Territorial Army in the 1960s reduced the regiment to a squadron assigned to an infantry role. In the 1990s, the squadron returned to an armour role in the <a href="Royal%20Wessex%20Yeomanry">Royal Wessex Yeomanry</a>, tasked with training replacement crews for the regular army's <a href="Challenger%202">Challenger 2</a> tanks.

In 1794, fearing insurrection and faced with the threat of invasion during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, British Prime Minister <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a> made the first ever recorded mention of yeoman cavalry when he called for an augmentation of the cavalry for internal defence. The government subsequently proposed a plan to all <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant">Lord-Lieutenants</a> – the monarch's personal representative in each <a href="county">county</a> – to increase the forces at the nation's disposal. This included the raising of volunteer <a href="troop">troop</a>s of cavalry consisting of <a href="Gentleman">gentlemen</a> and <a href="yeomanry">yeomanry</a>. Each troop comprised 50 to 80 men, commanded by the person raising it. Commanders received a temporary rank ranging from Captain to Colonel, depending on the number of troops raised. Officers were generally appointed from among the <a href="nobility">nobility</a> and <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, and troops were largely recruited from <a href="Land%20tenure">landholders</a> and <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s. Members provided their own horses and were not paid except when called out. Uniforms were provided by the commanders, and weapons by the government. The yeomanry could only be called out by the Lord-Lieutenant or royal warrant to suppress civil unrest in home or neighbouring counties, or by royal warrant in the event of foreign invasion. The individual troops of the Corps of Gentlemen and Yeomanry, as the force was first called, were initially independent, and only later would they combine to form regiments. Each troop was required to conduct exercises, or 'permanent duty', initially for twelve days each year, reduced to six in 1816.

The first yeomanry troop raised in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> was the 60-strong First or <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> Troop of Gloucestershire Gentlemen and Yeomanry, formed in 1795 by Powell Snell, a gentleman of means and good position. In total, eight troops had been raised by 1798. Following the 1802 <a href="Peace%20of%20Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a>, all except the Cheltenham Troop were disbanded, but the following year <a href="Napoleon%27s%20planned%20invasion%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom</a> prompted the re-establishment of several old troops and the formation of new troops; by the end of 1803 there were thirteen troops in Gloucestershire, and in 1813 the county's yeomanry had a strength of 582 men. As well as permanent duty, the yeomanry assembled as required for ceremonial and peace-keeping purposes; the Gloucester Troop provided an escort during the visit of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> to the city in 1807, and in 1810 it was called out to an affray between Irish militia and citizens in a local pub. A general reduction in volunteer forces followed the defeat of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, and by 1815 all yeomanry troops in Gloucestershire except one were disbanded. Only the Gloucester Troop was retained, as a mounted police force, until it too was disbanded in 1827.

New troops of yeomanry were raised in the 1830s in response to the <a href="Swing%20Riots">Swing Riots</a>. The first such troop established in Gloucestershire was the <a href="Marshfield%2C%20Gloucestershire">Marshfield</a> and <a href="Dodington%2C%20Gloucestershire">Dodington</a> Troop, raised in 1830 by <a href="Christopher%20William%20Codrington">William Codrington</a>, from which the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars dated its formation. The troop comprised three officers, a <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>, four <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s, a trumpeter and fifty troopers, and was recruited from the tenants of Codrington's estate and those of his neighbours, including that of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a>. In 1831, six more troops were raised by members of the Gloucestershire gentry in <a href="Fairford">Fairford</a> and <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a>, Stroudwater, <a href="Tetbury">Tetbury</a>, <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Winterbourne%2C%20Gloucestershire">Winterbourne</a> and <a href="Stapleton%2C%20Bristol">Stapleton</a>, and <a href="Alveston">Alveston</a>. That same year, the Dodington and Tetbury Troops were sent to Bristol in response to <a href="Bristol%20riots">civil unrest</a> following the defeat of the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Second Reform Bill</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

In 1834, all of the Gloucestershire yeomanry captains met in the hamlet of <a href="Petty%20France%2C%20Gloucestershire">Petty France</a> in south Gloucestershire and agreed to combine their troops into a single regiment, to be named the Gloucestershire Yeomanry Cavalry. Its first commanding officer was the Marquis of Worcester, who became the <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">7th Duke of Beaufort</a> in 1835, thus beginning the regiment's long association with the Beaufort family. The new regiment was ranked 24th in the <a href="yeomanry%20order%20of%20precedence">yeomanry order of precedence</a> and comprised seven troops with a total strength of 26 officers and 382 other ranks. Adopting the uniform of light <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s, each man was armed with sword and pistol, and twelve <a href="skirmisher">skirmisher</a>s in each troop were armed with <a href="Muzzleloader">muzzle-loading</a> <a href="carbine">carbine</a>s. The regiment's first deployment came in 1838, when the Dodington and Winterbourne Troops helped police a <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> rally in Bristol. The 'Royal' prefix was granted in 1841, and in 1847 the regiment adopted a blue <a href="hussar">hussar</a> uniform and the name Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. The authority of the Duke of Beaufort is evident in his order, in 1846, that all members should grow moustaches "in the form of a carving knife", an instruction that was derided in the pages of <a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a> magazine at the time, and his insistence the next year that the regiment wear the second jacket over the back, Hungarian style, instead of the usual English-style over the shoulder.

The influence of the social order on the composition of the regiment at this time can be observed from an incident in 1847. It involved a disagreement between <a href="William%20Berkeley%2C%201st%20Earl%20FitzHardinge">Lord FitzHardinge</a>, Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and his brother, <a href="Grantley%20Berkeley">Grantley Berkeley</a>, a <a href="member%20of%20parliament">member of parliament</a> and captain of the Berkeley Troop, which had joined the regiment in 1840. In pursuing his grievance against his brother, FitzHardinge pressured his tenants into resigning from the troop and threatened some with the loss of their farms if they did not. Further insight into the regiment's strong ties to the farming community can be found in the records of the annual exercises. In 1865, the permanent duty was deferred until the autumn due to an early harvest, and participation in a major 14-day exercise in 1871 was cancelled due to a late harvest. Attendance at the annual assemblies dropped below 300 men in the late 1870s and early 1880s, compared to 445 in 1875, due to a succession of bad harvests. In 1890, the regiment boasted four Masters of Hounds and a large number of <a href="Fox%20hunting">fox hunters</a> in its membership, both officers and other ranks, and that year it adopted an old hunting song, "D'ye ken John Peel", as its regimental march.

The establishment of a civilian <a href="History%20of%20law%20enforcement%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">police force</a> and renewed fears of invasion in the mid-19th century turned the yeomanry's focus to national defence. In 1871, <a href="Westley%20Richards">Westley Richards</a> <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading</a> carbines replaced the muzzle-loading carbines and were issued to all troopers rather than just the skirmishers, and three years later responsibility for the yeomanry was transferred from the Lord-Lieutenants to district military commanders of the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>. In 1867, the regiment's annual inspection had involved drill, but from 1875 the regiment was practising outpost duties, reconnaissance, and rear-guard exercises in the local hills. As the years passed, old troops were disbanded, renamed or amalgamated and new troops raised, and in 1893 the troops then existing were formally organised by order of the army into squadrons:
The order also allocated the yeomanry regiments to brigades and required them to train at brigade level every three years. Accordingly, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars joined the <a href="Royal%20Wiltshire%20Yeomanry">Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry</a> in the 3rd Yeomanry Brigade, and the two regiments conducted their first joint permanent duty in 1895.
In 1899, the British government created the <a href="Imperial%20Yeomanry">Imperial Yeomanry</a> to reinforce the regular army during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, and the existing Yeomanry Cavalry regiments were asked to provide volunteers. The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars contributed a contingent of 125 men, around half of whom were existing members, the remainder being recruited into the regiment when they enlisted for service in South Africa. They were folded into the Imperial Yeomanry as C Company, 1st Battalion, which arrived in South Africa in 1900 and saw its first action on 5 May at <a href="Thaba%20%27Nchu">Thaba 'Nchu</a>. It served for 18 months, as mounted rifles rather than cavalry, and came under fire 65 times, though more men were lost to sickness than enemy action. On their return to the UK in July 1901, the men of the 1st Battalion were absorbed back into their parent regiments, and the veterans of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars endowed the regiment with its first <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>, "South Africa 1900–01".

In April 1901, the domestic Yeomanry Cavalry was renamed to the Imperial Yeomanry. The reorganisation set an established regimental strength of 593 (later reduced to 476) all ranks – organised as before into four squadrons, but with the addition of a machine-gun section – replaced carbines and swords with <a href="Lee%E2%80%93Enfield">Lee–Enfield</a> <a href="rifle">rifle</a>s and <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s, and introduced a standard khaki uniform. The Imperial Yeomanry's mounted rifles role in South Africa and the reorganisation, along with the new uniforms and equipment, led to fears that the yeomanry was being relegated from cavalry to infantry. The regiment petitioned the King for permission to retain the sword on parade, and by 1913 the weapon had been re-introduced in place of the bayonet for general use. The Imperial Yeomanry as an organisation lasted only until 1908, when the <a href="Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907">Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907</a> came into effect and brought all volunteer forces, including the yeomanry, together into the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>. The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars conducted its first annual training under the new scheme between 19 May and 2 June 1909, when the <a href="13th%20Cavalry%20Brigade%20%28British%20Indian%20Army%29">1st South Midland Mounted Brigade</a>, of which the regiment was now part, assembled with the <a href="1st%20South%20Western%20Mounted%20Brigade">1st South Western Mounted Brigade</a> for exercises on <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>.

Following the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the regiment mobilised on 4 August 1914 and joined the rest of the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade at Warwick eight days later. By the end of the month, the brigade had assembled on the <a href="Berkshire%20Downs">Berkshire Downs</a> with the rest of the <a href="2nd%20Mounted%20Division">2nd Mounted Division</a>, which was subsequently stationed on home defence duties on the east coast of England. As a territorial regiment, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was not obliged to serve overseas but could volunteer to do so, and when it did, a second-line regiment was formed in September 1914 to take its place on home defence duties. A third regiment was raised in 1915 as a reserve and to provide replacements for the first two. The regiments were numbered the 1/1st, 2/1st and 3/1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars.

The second-line regiment spent most of the war stationed at various locations in England, initially as part of the 2/1st South Midland Mounted Brigade (subsequently renamed the 10th Mounted Brigade) in the 2/2nd Mounted Division (subsequently renamed the <a href="3rd%20Mounted%20Division">3rd Mounted Division</a>). In July 1916, the regiment swapped horses for bicycles and joined the <a href="8th%20Cyclist%20Brigade">8th Cyclist Brigade</a> in the <a href="4th%20Mounted%20Division">2nd Cyclist Division</a>. In November, the regiment was merged with the <a href="2/1st%20Queen%27s%20Own%20Worcestershire%20Hussars">2/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars</a> to form the 12th (Gloucestershire and Worcestershire) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in the 4th Cyclist Brigade, but resumed its original identity as the 2/1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars in March 1917. Around April 1918, the regiment moved to Ireland and was stationed at Dublin, where it remained, still in the 4th Cyclist Brigade, until the end of the war. The third-line regiment became part of the <a href="Cavalry%20Reserve%20Regiments%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Cavalry Reserve</a> at Tidworth, initially affiliated to the <a href="4th%20Reserve%20Cavalry%20Regiment">4th Reserve Cavalry Regiment</a> and subsequently to the <a href="5th%20Reserve%20Cavalry%20Regiment">5th Reserve Cavalry Regiment</a>.

In April 1915, the 2nd Mounted Division sailed to Egypt, and the 1/1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, less C Squadron, disembarked at Alexandria on 24 April. On 14 August, the regiment embarked without its horses for <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> and arrived at <a href="Landing%20at%20Suvla%20Bay">Suvla Bay</a> three days later. It fought as infantry at Chocolate Hill on 21 August, supporting the attack of the <a href="29th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Division</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Scimitar%20Hill">Battle of Scimitar Hill</a>, during which the regiment suffered 61 casualties. It remained in the area until the end of October, serving periods of duty in reserve and in the support and front-line trenches. During this time it continued to lose men to sickness and enemy shelling, and of the original contingent of 361 all ranks that had landed over two months previously, only some 100 men were still fit for duty when the regiment departed Gallipoli on 31 October.

After a short spell on <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, the regiment arrived back in Egypt in November 1915. It returned to the cavalry role and was brought back up to strength, numbering 370 all ranks in January 1916. The same month, the 2nd Mounted Division was disbanded, and the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade – renamed the 5th Mounted Brigade in April – became corps troops for the <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XV Corps</a>, stationed in the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> area. In late March, the regiment was patrolling the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>, and at the end of the month it assembled at Romani (modern day Rommana), some east of the canal.

Early on 23 April, A Squadron was stationed at Qatia (or Katia), some south-east of Romani. At 09:15 it came under attack by a Turkish force of between 1,000 and 1,500 infantry, supported by cavalry and a battery of <a href="mountain%20gun">mountain gun</a>s, which had already overwhelmed two squadrons of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Worcestershire%20Hussars">Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars</a> and a party of <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> further east at Oghratina. The squadron was reinforced by a squadron of Worcesters, and the regiment's own B and D Squadrons moved out of Romani in support. The defenders at Qatia held out until mid-afternoon before being overwhelmed, and B and D Squadrons, which had been heavily engaged in the attempt to reach Qatia, retired back to Romani. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Katia">Battle of Katia</a> cost the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars 98 casualties, most of them being taken prisoner, and only nine men of A Squadron evaded death or captivity. The squadron was criticised for advancing too far, and an Australian soldier who visited Qatia labelled the yeomen "country bumpkins led by privileged toffs". When he unveiled the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars war memorial in 1922, Lieutenant-General Sir <a href="Philip%20Chetwode%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chetwode">Philip Chetwode</a> countered the "very wrong criticism", saying that "there was nothing to be ashamed of, but everything to make them proud of their regiment".

While A Squadron was being rebuilt, B and D Squadrons joined a squadron from the Worcestershire Hussars to form a composite regiment within the 5th Mounted Brigade. On 4 August, D Squadron, detached to the <a href="42nd%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Infantry%20Division">42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division</a>, played a conspicuous role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Battle of Romani</a> when it plugged and held for three hours a dangerous gap on the initiative of its commander, <a href="Major">Major</a> Charles Turner, for which he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO). The squadron rejoined the composite regiment after the 5th Mounted Brigade arrived in support, and when the Anzac and British mounted brigades counter-attacked in the afternoon, the regiment took a ridge at the gallop and subsequently captured 500 prisoners, a battery of four guns and two machine guns. For the rest of the battle, the 5th Mounted Brigade came under command of the <a href="ANZAC%20Mounted%20Division">ANZAC Mounted Division</a> and took part in the capture of Qatia and the pursuit of the enemy to Bir el Abd. British Empire forces continued to advance across the Sinai, and the regiment was next in action on 9 January 1917, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rafa">Battle of Rafa</a>, during which it fought dismounted, suffering 46 casualties.

Following the Battle of Rafa, the 5th Mounted Brigade transferred from corps troops to the Imperial Mounted Division (renamed in June to the <a href="Australian%20Mounted%20Division">Australian Mounted Division</a>) in the <a href="Desert%20Column">Desert Column</a> (reorganised in August as the <a href="Desert%20Mounted%20Corps">Desert Mounted Corps</a>). On 26 March, the mounted divisions, less the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, invested Gaza from the east and north in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a>. The regiment, attached to the <a href="53rd%20%28Welsh%29%20Infantry%20Division">53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division</a>, was deployed along the coast, covering the division's left flank as it attacked Gaza from the south. The attempt to capture Gaza suffered from delays caused by fog, and the attack was called off in the late afternoon. The <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Second Battle of Gaza</a> in April, during which the regiment fought with the rest of the cavalry as mounted infantry on the right flank of the main infantry attack, fared no better, and the opposing sides settled into a period of inaction.

In June, General <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a> was appointed commander of the <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a>, and at the end of October he resumed the British Empire <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">offensive in southern Palestine</a>. The regiment was in corps reserve during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a>, but saw action on 4 November in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tel%20el%20Khuweilfe">Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe</a>, during which it suffered 14 casualties. The regiment supported, but did not participate in, the <a href="Charge%20at%20Huj">Charge at Huj</a>, and fought a defensive action on 12 November, immediately before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mughar%20Ridge">Battle of Mughar Ridge</a>, when a Turkish counter-attack pushed the 5th Mounted Brigade back from Balin at a cost to the regiment of 21 casualties. In the early hours of 1 December, the regiment helped defeat a Turkish counter-attack against the high ground north and north-east of <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>, and for the rest of the month it was employed in guard duties, reconnaissance, fortification works and as divisional reserve.

The regiment remained in reserve while Allenby secured his right flank with the <a href="British%20occupation%20of%20the%20Jordan%20Valley">occupation of the Jordan valley</a> in early 1918, and when not on duty the men entertained themselves with fox hunts, a <a href="Steeplechase%20%28horse%20racing%29">steeplechase</a>, and periods of leave in Jaffa and <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. At the end of April, the regiment travelled a biblical route through Jerusalem, <a href="Calvary">Calvary</a>, the <a href="Mount%20of%20Olives">Mount of Olives</a>, <a href="Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>, <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a>, <a href="Mount%20Nebo">Mount Nebo</a>, the alleged site of the inn of the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan">Good Samaritan</a> and across the Jordan valley. It fought dismounted in the <a href="Second%20Transjordan%20attack%20on%20Shunet%20Nimrin%20and%20Es%20Salt">Second Action of Es Salt</a> at the beginning of May, and when that operation ended in defeat, it retired with the British Empire forces back into the valley. The regiment remained until August in the "valley of death", where temperatures peaked above and malaria was a constant problem, with only brief periods of relief. It suffered more from sickness in the inhospitable environment than from enemy action; in May alone the regiment suffered 16 casualties in battle, while 116 men were hospitalised due to illness.

In August, the 5th Mounted Brigade became the 13th Cavalry Brigade and was transferred to the <a href="5th%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28India%29">5th Cavalry Division</a>, which moved to the coastal sector in preparation for the next phase of the offensive. On 19 September, the division led the exploitation of a breach made in the enemy lines by the infantry in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sharon">Battle of Sharon</a>, and after an advance of over the regiment, acting in the traditional cavalry role, entered <a href="Battle%20of%20Nazareth">Nazareth</a> with swords drawn early the next day. Although it was ordered to withdraw later that morning, it returned and completed the capture of the town on 21 September. By the end of September the regiment had reached <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, and on 27 October, shortly before the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Mudros">Armistice of Mudros</a> ended hostilities, it entered <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. During the march, the regiment recovered the sword of Captain Lloyd-Baker, commander of A Squadron, over two years after it was taken by the Turks following his death at Qatia, and on 21 November the regiment entertained nine of its own recently released prisoners of war who had been captured at Qatia.

The regiment remained in Palestine immediately after the war and was demobilised in stages. The first party returned to the UK in January 1919, only two squadrons remained by March, and those not yet eligible for demobilisation were transferred to the <a href="Sherwood%20Rangers%20Yeomanry">Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry</a> in June. The remaining cadre of 28 men began their journey home at the end of June and arrived in Gloucester on 15 August. The names of the 28 officers and 200 other ranks of the regiment killed in the war are recorded on the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a>, unveiled on 29 April 1922 in the grounds of <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a>.

The Territorial Force was reconstituted in 1920 and renamed the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (TA) shortly afterwards, and the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars began to recruit new members. On 21 October, its strength was 10 officers and 37 other ranks, rising to 16 officers and 208 other ranks by August 1921. The same year, the War Office ruled that only the fourteen most senior yeomanry regiments would be retained as cavalry, and offered the remainder the choice of converting to units of the <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a> or reducing in size and converting to <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> companies. On 25 November, the regiment chose the latter to become the 21st (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Armoured Car Company (TA) in the Royal Tank Corps (renamed in 1939 to the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>). The company comprised a headquarters (HQ) and four sections, each section equipped with four <a href="Peerless%20Armoured%20Car">Peerless Armoured Car</a>s, replaced in 1928–1929 by <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Armoured%20Car">Rolls-Royce Armoured Car</a>s.

As war loomed again in Europe, the UK expanded its armed forces. The 21st (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Armoured Car Company was converted to a full armoured regiment and, on 30 April 1939, regained its original title as the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. The TA was doubled in size, with each regiment creating a duplicate, and in the summer of 1939 the 1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was recruiting in Gloucester, Cirencester and Bristol, while the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was recruiting in Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and Tetbury. Attendance at the annual camp in July 1939 was about 1,000 yeomen, compared to some 300 the previous year.

On the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the 1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was equipped with Vickers <a href="Light%20tanks%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Mk. IV</a> and <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mk%20VI">Mk. VI</a> light tanks and initially served in home defence. It was later re-equipped with <a href="Valentine%20tank">Valentine tank</a>s and earmarked for service in North Africa as part of the <a href="6th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Armoured Division</a>, but a last minute change resulted in the unit remaining in the UK as a training regiment which, by the war's end, had trained over 5,000 officers and men. As the war was nearing its conclusion the regiment was equipped with <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill tank</a>s and prepared for service in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, but following <a href="VJ%20Day">VJ Day</a> it was re-equipped with <a href="M4%20Sherman">Sherman tanks</a> and <a href="M8%20Greyhound">Greyhound armoured cars</a> and sent instead to Austria as part of the army of occupation in December 1945. The 3rd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was actually a troop of one officer and 30 men. It served variously as a training regiment, trials unit and decoy, constructing <a href="dummy%20tank">dummy tank</a>s to deceive the enemy about the disposition and strength of British armour.

After completing its training in the UK, the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars deployed to Egypt in October 1941. By the middle of November it had assembled south-west of Mersa Matruh, close to the Libyan border, as part of the <a href="22nd%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">22nd Armoured Brigade</a> attached to the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured Division</a>, the "Desert Rats". At this stage the regiment comprised 43 officers and 585 other ranks organised into three tank squadrons – F, G and H – with a regimental HQ and a rear echelon component responsible for supply. It was equipped with 52 <a href="Crusader%20tank">Crusader tank</a>s, 10 scout vehicles and 112 wheeled vehicles.

In <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a>, the 7th Armoured Division was tasked with locating and destroying the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> armour, and the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was the lead element of the 22nd Armoured Brigade's advance. On 19 November, the brigade encountered the Italian <a href="132nd%20Armoured%20Division%20Ariete">Ariete Division</a>, and in the ensuing <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bir%20el%20Gubi">First Battle of Bir el Gubi</a> it lost 40 tanks. Of the brigade's three regiments, the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars fared the worst. The regiment overran some Italian anti-tank positions, but without infantry support it could not take their surrender. The Italians subsequently returned to their guns and caught the regiment's tanks in a crossfire. The Crusader's armour could be defeated at ranges of while its gun was ineffective at ranges greater than , and at one stage the regiment was outnumbered five or six to one. The day's fighting cost the regiment 30 tanks and some 50 casualties. Among the wounded was the regiment's commanding officer, <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> Charles Birley, who, after suffering a broken arm when his tank was disabled, sat exposed on another and directed the regiment until it withdrew at the end of the day, for which action he was awarded the DSO.

The regiment, down to a single composite squadron of 19 tanks, was in action again on 22 and 23 November at Sidi Rezegh. The 7th Armoured Division was badly mauled by the German <a href="15th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">15th</a> and <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st</a> Panzer Divisions before the German armour broke contact and pushed on towards the Egyptian border. In the respite, the regiment, which at one stage had been reduced to just four Crusaders, was reinforced with five <a href="M3%20Stuart">M3 Stuart</a>s – named "Honey" by the British – five Crusaders, and a squadron of <a href="Cruiser%20Mk%20IV">Cruiser Mk IV</a>s from the <a href="2nd%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">2nd Royal Tank Regiment</a>. The regiment fought next in the Sidi Rezegh area on 27 and 28 November, finding itself once again outgunned by enemy armour returning from its raid on the Egyptian border. After the battle, the regiment was withdrawn and re-equipped with 52 Honies which had already seen battle with the <a href="8th%20King%27s%20Royal%20Irish%20Hussars">8th King's Royal Irish Hussars</a>. As well as materiel losses, the fighting to date had cost the regiment 16 officers and 70 other ranks. Major W. A. B. Trevor, who had assumed command of the regiment after Birley was wounded, was awarded the DSO for his handling of the regiment.
In December, the regiment fought at various times under command of the 7th Armoured Division's <a href="7th%20Support%20Group%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Support Group</a> and the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20and%20Headquarters%20North%20East">4th Armoured Brigade</a>. It rejoined the 22nd Armoured Brigade in the last week of December and completed a long march across the desert as the British and Commonwealth forces pushed the Axis forces out of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>. As Operation Crusader drew to a close, the regiment saw action around Chor es Sufan on 28 and 30 December, after which the 7th Armoured Division was relieved by the <a href="1st%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%20Division">1st Armoured Division</a>. In total, the regiment had suffered 169 casualties.

Birley, his arm in a sling, resumed command of the regiment on 13 January 1942, and when a <a href="Afrika%20Korps">German Africa Corps</a> counter-attack pushed the British and Commonwealth forces back to Gazala later that month, he commanded Birley Force, a composite regiment to which the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars contributed the HQ and a squadron of tanks. The regiment was re-equipped in the first week of February; F Squadron with the new <a href="M3%20Lee">M3 Grant</a> tanks, and G and H Squadrons with Crusaders, and in May its strength was 36 officers, 563 other ranks and 48 tanks. At the end of May, with the 22nd Armoured Brigade now returned to its parent unit, the 1st Armoured Division, the regiment saw action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>. It fought in the areas of Bir el Harmat and 'Knightsbridge', a defensive box held by the <a href="22nd%20Guards%20Brigade">201st Guards Motor Brigade</a> some south-west of Tobruk. At the start of the battle, F Squadron lost all but one of its Grants, and the regiment was quickly reduced to 16 Crusaders and two Honies. These were formed into a composite squadron under command of the 3rd <a href="County%20of%20London%20Yeomanry">County of London Yeomanry</a>. On 1 June the regiment handed over its remaining Crusaders to the 4th County of London Yeomanry and was taken out of the line for a refit the next day.

The regiment returned to the line on 4 June with Honies and Grants taken over from the <a href="4th%20Queen%27s%20Own%20Hussars">4th Queen's Own Hussars</a>; 14 tanks each in G and H Squadrons, 4 in the regimental HQ and 12 Grants in F Squadron. The next day it participated in a failed attack at Bir el Aslagh in the 'Cauldron', a German salient behind the original British and Commonwealth lines. It then retired east to Knightsbridge where, on 6 June, the command tank was hit, killing Birley and the regiment's <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>. The regiment was by this stage down to a strength of 17 Honies and two Grants, and for the next two days, with Trevor once again in command, it acted as a patrol squadron for 22nd Armoured Brigade. On 10 June, H Squadron was attached to the 7th Motor Brigade (the former Support Group) fighting around <a href="Battle%20of%20Bir%20Hakeim">Bir Hacheim</a>. It remained with that brigade until the end of the month, while the remainder of the regiment was withdrawn from the line. In addition to the losses in materiel, the Battle of Gazala had cost the regiment 82 casualties, and on 12 June another was added to the list when Trevor was killed in an airstrike. Over the next few days the remaining senior officers appealed to brigade, division and corps commanders to prevent the regiment from being split up and used as replacements.

Following defeat in the Battle of Gazala, the British and Commonwealth forces halted the Axis advance in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>, in which G Squadron fought while attached at various times to the 1st Armoured Division Tank Delivery Regiment, the 4th County of London Yeomanry and the <a href="9th%20Queen%27s%20Royal%20Lancers">9th Queen's Royal Lancers</a>. Meanwhile, F and H Squadrons became infantry in the <a href="10th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">10th Armoured Division</a> and, armed with Italian anti-tank rifles, grenades and <a href="molotov%20cocktail">molotov cocktail</a>s, manned defences in the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Delta</a>. At the end of July, H Squadron took over the Crusaders of A Squadron, 5th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), and relieved them in the El Alamein line, and F Squadron similarly replaced 5RTR's C Squadron on 17 August. The same month, G Squadron was given Crusaders and allocated to Army reserve at El Amiriya, serving at various times under the command of the 8th Hussars, an Indian brigade, the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Australian Division</a> and finally the <a href="10th%20Royal%20Hussars">10th Royal Hussars</a>. The regiment's rear echelon and some of its HQ troops guarded bridges over the Nile in the Delta.

During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a>, the regiment's F and H Squadrons fought as units of the 5th Royal Tank Regiment, and G Squadron was part of an abortive 9th Australian Division attack along the coast. The three squadrons were reunited in Alexandria on 20 September, but any hopes that the regiment would fight again under its own command were dashed when F, G and H Squadrons were transferred to the 4th Hussars, the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and the 8th Hussars respectively. HQ Squadron was divided between the 5th Royal Tank Regiment and the <a href="3rd%20The%20King%27s%20Own%20Hussars">3rd The King's Own Hussars</a>, and the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was disbanded on 15 January 1943. During its brief career the regiment had lost 72 men killed, 100 wounded and 85 taken prisoner of war, and was awarded two DSOs, seven <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>es, a <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a> and fourteen <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>s.

The regiment was reconstituted in the reconnaissance role in 1947, equipped initially with <a href="Daimler%20Armoured%20Car">Daimler Armoured Car</a>s which were later replaced by <a href="Ferret%20armoured%20car">Ferret scout vehicles</a>. On 27 May 1962, a new <a href="Guidon%20%28Commonwealth%29">Guidon</a> was presented on behalf of the <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen</a> by Colonel <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%2010th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">the Duke of Beaufort</a> at <a href="Badminton%20House">Badminton House</a>, and in 1963 the regiment was granted the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of Gloucester</a>. In 1967, following a reorganisation of the TA, the regiment was reduced to a squadron and combined with elements of the <a href="North%20Somerset%20Yeomanry">North Somerset and Bristol Yeomanry</a>, the 5th Battalion <a href="Gloucestershire%20Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> and the <a href="Gloucestershire%20Volunteer%20Artillery">Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery</a> to form the Wessex Volunteers. A further reorganisation in 1969 reduced the squadron to a cadre of eight men, but it was expanded two years later to provide the regimental HQ and two squadrons in the infantry-roled Wessex Yeomanry, which in 1979 became the <a href="Royal%20Wessex%20Yeomanry">Royal Wessex Yeomanry</a>. In 1983, the new yeomanry regiment was equipped with stripped-down <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>s and took on the reconnaissance role. It was further reorganised and re-purposed as an armoured reserve regiment in the 1990s, tasked with the provision of replacement crews for the regular army's <a href="Challenger%202">Challenger 2</a> tanks. The Gloucestershire yeomanry lineage is maintained in the Royal Wessex Yeomanry by C (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Squadron.

The battle honours earned by the regiment were:

Bog turtle

The bog turtle ("Glyptemys muhlenbergii") is a critically endangered <a href="species">species</a> of semiaquatic <a href="turtle">turtle</a> <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="eastern%20United%20States">eastern United States</a>. It was first scientifically described in 1801 after an 18th-century survey of Pennsylvania. The smallest North American turtle, its <a href="carapace">carapace</a> measures about long when fully grown. Although the bog turtle is similar in appearance to the <a href="painted%20turtle">painted</a> or <a href="spotted%20turtle">spotted turtle</a>s, its closest relative is actually the somewhat larger <a href="wood%20turtle">wood turtle</a>. The bog turtle can be found from Vermont in the north, south to Georgia, and west to Ohio. <a href="Diurnality">Diurnal</a> and secretive, it spends most of its time buried in mud and – during the winter months – in hibernation. The bog turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on small <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a>. The bog turtle is the state reptile of New Jersey.

Adult bog turtles weigh on average. Their skins and shells are typically dark brown, with a distinctive orange spot on each side of the neck. Considered <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> at the federal level, the bog turtle is protected under the United States' <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. Invasive plants and urban development have eradicated much of the bog turtle's habitat, substantially reducing its numbers. Demand for the bog turtle is high in the <a href="black%20market">black market</a> pet trade, partly because of its small size and unique characteristics. Various private projects have been undertaken in an attempt to reverse the decline in the turtle's population.

The turtle has a low reproduction rate; females lay one <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> per year, with an average of three <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> each. The young tend to grow rapidly, reaching sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 10 years old. Bog turtles live for an average of 20 to 30 years in the wild. Since 1973, the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a> has successfully bred bog turtles in captivity.

The bog turtle was noted in the 18th century by <a href="Gotthilf%20Heinrich%20Ernst%20Muhlenberg">Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg</a>, a self-taught <a href="botanist">botanist</a> and <a href="clergyman">clergyman</a>. Muhlenberg, who named more than 150 North American plant species, was conducting a survey of the <a href="flora">flora</a> of <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster County, Pennsylvania</a>, when he discovered the small turtle. In 1801, <a href="Johann%20David%20Schoepf">Johann David Schoepf</a>f named Muhlenberg's discovery as "Testudo muhlenbergii" in Muhlenberg's honor.

In 1829, <a href="Richard%20Harlan">Richard Harlan</a> renamed the turtle "Emys muhlenbergii". The species was subsequently renamed to "Calemys muhlenbergii" by <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> in 1857, and to "Clemmys muhlenbergii" by <a href="Henry%20Watson%20Fowler">Henry Watson Fowler</a> in 1906. <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">Synonyms</a> include "Emys biguttata", named in 1824 by <a href="Thomas%20Say">Thomas Say</a> on the basis of a turtle from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and "Clemmys nuchalis", described by Dunn in 1917 from near <a href="Linville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Linville, North Carolina</a>. Today, there are various names for the bog turtle, including mud turtle, marsh turtle, yellowhead, and snapper.

The genus name was changed to "Glyptemys" in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, "Glyptemys insculpta", had until then been included in the genus "<a href="Clemmys">Clemmys</a>", which also included spotted turtles ("C. guttata") and <a href="western%20pond%20turtle">western pond turtle</a>s ("C. marmorata"). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus "Glyptemys".

The bog turtle is the smallest species of turtle in North America. The adults weigh approximately when fully grown. It does not have a prominent snout. Its head is dark brown to black; however, it has a bright yellow, orange, or red spot on each side of its neck. The spot is often forked, facing <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Anterior%20and%20posterior">posteriorly</a>. The bog turtle has a dark skin color with an orange-red wash on the inside of the legs of some individuals. The carapace is domed and rectangular in shape, and it tends to be narrower toward the head and wider toward the tail. The carapace often has easily identifiable rings on the rough scales or <a href="scutes">scutes</a>. The scutes may also have a radiating arrangement of lines. In some older individuals, and those that burrow frequently in coarse <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a>, the shell may be smooth. Although generally black, a <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> sunburst pattern in each scute is sometimes present on the carapace. The belly of the shell, the <a href="plastron">plastron</a>, is also a dark brown to black color with light marks present.

The spotted turtle and painted turtle are similar in appearance to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference between it and the spotted turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.

Mature male bog turtles have an average length of while the average female length is (straight carapace measurement). The males have a larger average body size than females, likely to facilitate males during male–male interactions during mate selection. The female has a wider and higher shell than the male, but the male's head is squared and larger than a female's of the same age. The plastron of the male looks slightly concave while the female's is flat. The male's tail is longer and thicker than the female's. The <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a> is further towards the end of the tail of the male bog turtle, while the female's cloaca is positioned inside the plastron. Juveniles are very difficult to sex.

The bog turtle is native only to the eastern United States, congregating in <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a> that often consist of fewer than 20 individuals. They prefer calcareous wetlands (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, marshes, and spring <a href="seep%20%28hydrology%29">seeps</a>, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often on the edge of woods. Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.

The bog turtles' preferred habitat, sometimes called a <a href="fen">fen</a>, is slightly acidic with a high water table year-round. The constant saturation leads to the depletion of oxygen, subsequently resulting in <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">anaerobic conditions</a>. The bog turtle uses soft, deep mud to shelter from predators and the weather. Spring seeps and groundwater springs provide optimum locations for hibernation during winter. Home range size is gender dependent, averaging about for males and for females. However, research has shown that densities can range from 5 to 125 individuals per . The range of the bog turtle extensively overlaps that of its relative, the wood turtle.

<a href="Juncaceae">Rushes</a>, <a href="Carex%20stricta">tussock sedge</a>, <a href="Typha">cattails</a>, <a href="Impatiens">jewelweed</a>, <a href="sphagnum">sphagnum</a>, and various native <a href="Poaceae">true grasses</a> are found in the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as <a href="willow">willow</a>s, <a href="Acer%20rubrum">red maples</a>, and <a href="alder">alder</a>s. It is important for their habitat to have an open <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early <a href="succession%20%28ecology%29">successional</a>. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.

The northern and southern bog turtle populations are separated by a gap over much of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, which lacks bog turtle colonies. In both areas, the bog turtle colonies tend to occupy widely scattered ranges.

The northern population is the larger of the two. These individuals make their home in states as far north as Connecticut and Massachusetts, and as far south as Maryland. These turtles are known to have fewer than 200 habitable sites left, a number that is decreasing.

The southern population is much smaller in number (only about 96 colonies have been located), living in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. This area in particular has seen about 90 percent of its mountainous wetlands dry up. The turtles in this population are even more scattered than in the northern population and live at higher elevations, up to .

There have been only two recorded discoveries of bog turtle fossils. The late J. Alan Holman, a paleontologist and herpetologist, first identified bog turtle plastral remains in Cumberland Cave, Maryland (near <a href="Corriganville%2C%20Maryland">Corriganville</a>), which are of <a href="Irvingtonian">Irvingtonian</a> age (from to 300,000 years ago). The second discovery was of <a href="Rancholabrean">Rancholabrean</a> (between 300,000 and 11,000 years ago) shell pieces in the Giant Cement Quarry in South Carolina (near <a href="Harleyville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Harleyville</a>), by Bentely and Knight in 1998.

The bog turtle's <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> is composed of 50 <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a>.
Studies of variations in <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> indicate low levels of <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic divergence</a> among bog turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as the bog turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies). These conditions limit <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a>, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the bog turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a <a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a> – as colonies were forced south in the face of <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent <a href="Pleistocene">post-Pleistocene</a> expansion, as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present <a href="genetic%20isolate">genetically isolated</a>, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

The bog turtle is primarily <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>, active during the day and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends a great deal of the day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either <a href="estivate">estivate</a>, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.

Late September to March or April is usually spent in <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>, either alone or in small groups in spring seeps. These groups can contain up to 12 individuals, and sometimes can include other species of turtles. Bog turtles try to find an area of dense soil, such as a strong root system, for protection during the dormant period. However, they may hibernate in other places such as the bottom of a tree, animal burrows, or empty spaces in mud. The bog turtle emerges from hibernation when the air temperature is between .

The male bog turtle is territorial and will attack other males if they venture within of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches his foe, he tilts his carapace by withdrawing his head and raising his hind limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just a few minutes, with the larger and older male usually winning. The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of , from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).
Bog turtles are <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and eat aquatic plants (such as <a href="duckweed">duckweed</a>), seeds, berries, earthworms, <a href="snails">snails</a>, <a href="slugs">slugs</a>, insects, other invertebrates, <a href="frogs">frogs</a>, and other small vertebrates. They also occasionally eat <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.

A host of different animals, including <a href="snapping%20turtles">snapping turtles</a>, snake species such as "<a href="Nerodia%20sipedon">Nerodia sipedon</a>" and "<a href="Thamnophis%20sirtalis">Thamnophis sirtalis</a>", <a href="muskrats">muskrats</a>, striped skunks, <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="dog">dog</a>s, and <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches ("<a href="Placobdella%20multilineata">Placobdella multilineata</a>" and "<a href="P.%20parasitica">P. parasitica</a>") and parasitic flies ("<a href="Cistudinomyia%20cistudinis">Cistudinomyia cistudinis</a>") plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.

Bog turtles may suffer from bacterial infections. "<a href="Aeromonas">Aeromonas</a>" and "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" are two genera of bacteria that cause pneumonia in individuals. Bacterial aggregates (sometimes known as <a href="biofilm">biofilm</a>s) have also been found in the lungs of two deceased specimens discovered in 1982 and 1995 from colonies in the southern population.

Day-to-day, the bog turtle moves very little, typically basking in the sun and waiting for prey. Though it is not especially lively on sunny days, the bog turtle is usually active after rainfall. Various studies have found different rates of daily movement in bog turtles, varying from in males and in females. Both sexes are capable of homing when released at distances up to from their site of capture. The bog turtle will travel long distances to find a new habitat if its home becomes unsuitable. The species is most active during the spring, and males generally exhibit greater migration distance and seasonal activity than females as they defend their territory. Home-range migration distances have been recorded at for males and for females. Home-range sizes in Maryland vary from to with considerable amounts of variation between sites and years.

The bog turtle is <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> and can move both on land and in the water. The distance and frequency of movements on land help <a href="herpetology">herpetologists</a> understand the behavior, <a href="ecology">ecology</a>, gene flow, and the level of success of different bog turtle colonies. The vast majority of bog turtle movements are less than , and only 2 percent are of distances over ; large, expansive trips (i.e., between neighboring wetlands), are rare.

The movement of bog turtles between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement were to be prevented, or limited in any significant way, the species would have a higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity would fall. Some aspects of a bog turtle's movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate bog turtles to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual can be expected to travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.

Bog turtles are sexually mature when they reach between 8 and 11 years of age (both sexes). They mate in the spring after emerging from hibernation, in a copulation session that usually lasts for 5–20 minutes, typically during the afternoon, and may occur on land or in the water. It begins with the male recognizing the female's sex. During the courtship ritual, the male gently bites and nudges the female's head. Younger males tend to be more aggressive during copulation, and females sometimes try to avoid an over-aggressive male. However, as the female ages, she is more likely to accept the aggressiveness of a male, and may even take the role of initiator. If the female yields, she may withdraw her front limbs and head. After the entire process is over, which usually takes about 35 minutes, male and female go separate ways. In a single season, females may mate once, twice, or not at all, and males try to mate as many times as possible. It has been suggested that it is possible for the bog turtle to hybridize with "Clemmys guttata" during the mating season. However, it has not been genetically verified in wild populations.

<a href="nesting%20instinct">Nesting</a> takes place between April and July. The female digs a cavity in a dry, sunny area of a bog, and lays her eggs in a grass tussock or on sphagnum moss. The nest is typically deep and around. Like most species of turtle, the bog turtle constructs its nest using its hind feet and claws. Most bog turtle eggs are laid in June. <a href="Pregnant">Pregnant</a> females lay one to six eggs per <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> (mean of 3), and produce one clutch per year. A healthy female bog turtle can lay between 30 and 45 eggs in her lifetime, but many of the offspring do not survive to reach sexual maturity. Typically, older females lay more eggs than younger ones. The eggs are white, elliptical, and on average long and wide. After the eggs are laid, they are left to undergo an incubation period that lasts for 42 to 80 days. In colder climates, the eggs are incubated through the winter and hatch in the spring. The eggs are vulnerable during the incubation period, and often fall prey to mammals and birds. In addition, eggs may be jeopardized by flooding, frost, or various developmental problems. It is unknown how gender is determined in bog turtles.

Baby bog turtles are about long when they emerge from their eggs, usually in late August or September. Females are slightly smaller at birth, and tend to grow more slowly than males. Both genders grow rapidly until they reach maturity. Juveniles almost double in size in their first four years, but do not become fully grown until five or six years old.

The bog turtle spends its life almost exclusively in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35 years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35 years. The age of a bog turtle is determined by counting the number of rings in a <a href="scute">scute</a>, minus the first one (which develops before birth).

Protected under the United States Federal Endangered Species Act, the bog turtle is considered <a href="threatened">threatened</a> in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of November 4, 1997. Due to a "similarity of appearance" to the northern population, the bog turtle is also threatened in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia (considered to be the southern population). In addition to the federal listing of threatened, states in the southern range list the bog turtle as either endangered or threatened. Changes to the bog turtle's habitat have resulted in the disappearance of 80 percent of the colonies that existed 30 years ago. Because of the turtle's rarity, it is also in danger of illegal collection, often for the worldwide <a href="pet%20trade">pet trade</a>. Despite regulations prohibiting their collection, <a href="barter">barter</a>, or export, bog turtles are commonly taken by <a href="poachers">poachers</a>. Road traffic has also led to declines. The <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> has a plan for the recovery of the northern population. The bog turtle was listed as "critically endangered" in the 2011 IUCN Red List.

The <a href="Invasive%20species">invasion of non-native plants</a> into its habitat is a large threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are <a href="purple%20loosestrife">purple loosestrife</a>, <a href="reed%20canary%20grass">reed canary grass</a>, and <a href="Phragmites">reeds</a>, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder the movement of the turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.

The development of new neighborhoods and roadways obstructs the bog turtle's movement between wetlands, thus inhibiting the establishment of new bog turtle colonies. <a href="Pesticide">Pesticide</a>s, <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a>, and <a href="industrial%20waste">industrial discharge</a> are all harmful to the bog turtles' habitat and food supply. The bog turtle has been designated as a threatened species to "conserve the northern population of the bog turtle, which has seriously declined in the northeast United States."

Today, the rebounding of bog turtle colonies depends on private intervention. Population monitoring involves meticulous land surveys over vast countrysides. In addition to surveying land visually, <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> has been used to biologically classify a wetland as either suitable or unsuitable for a bog turtle colony. This allows for comparisons to be made between known areas of bog turtle success and potential areas of future habitation.
To help the existing colonies rebound, several private projects have been initiated in an attempt to limit the encroachment of overshadowing trees and bushes, the construction of new highways and neighborhoods, and other natural and man-made threats.

Methods used to recreate the bog turtle's habitat include: <a href="controlled%20burns">controlled burns</a> to limit the growth of overshadowing trees and underbrush (thus bringing the habitat back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows and goats in the desired habitat area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.

<a href="Captive%20breeding">Captive breeding</a> is another method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub were the first to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the <a href="Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a>, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.

The study of bog turtles in the wild is a significant aid to the development of a conservation strategy. <a href="Radio%20telemetry">Radio telemetry</a> has been used to track the turtles' movements in their natural habitat. Blood samples, fecal samples, and <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>l swabs are also commonly collected from wild populations and tested for signs of disease.

Ike Altgens

James William "Ike" Altgens (; April 28, 1919December 12, 1995) was an American <a href="photojournalism">photojournalist</a>, <a href="picture%20editor">photo editor</a>, and <a href="journalist">field reporter</a> for the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> (AP) based in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, who became known for his photographic work during the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of President John F. Kennedy</a> (JFK). Altgens was 19 when he began his AP career, which was interrupted by military service during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. When his service time ended, Altgens returned to Dallas and got married. He soon went back to work for the local AP bureau and eventually earned a position as a senior editor.

Altgens was on assignment for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second, showing <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a> <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy</a> toward the rear of the <a href="SS-100-X">presidential limousine</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="Clint%20Hill%20%28Secret%20Service%29">Clint Hill</a> on its bumper, was reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> was visible in the main doorway of the <a href="Texas%20School%20Book%20Depository">Texas School Book Depository</a> as the gunshots were fired at JFK.

Altgens appeared briefly as a film actor and model during his 40-year career with the AP, which ended in 1979. He spent his later years working in display advertising, and answering letters and other requests made by assassination researchers. Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 at about the same time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">poisoning</a> by a malfunctioning furnace also may have contributed to their deaths.

Ike Altgens was born James William Altgens on April 28, 1919, in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, to Willie May ( Pitchford), a housewife, and J. H. Altgens, a machinist. He had a younger sister, Mary. Altgens was orphaned as a child and raised by a widowed aunt. He was hired by the Associated Press in 1938 when he was 19, shortly after his graduation from <a href="North%20Dallas%20High%20School">North Dallas High School</a>. Altgens began his career handling various assignments and writing some sports articles. He showed a talent for photography and was assigned in 1940 to work in the wirephoto office.

Altgens' career was interrupted by service in the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; he moonlighted as a radio <a href="broadcasting">broadcaster</a> during this time. Following his return to Dallas from military service, he married Clara Halliburton in July 1944. Altgens went back to work for the AP in 1945 and was assigned to its news bureau. He also attended night classes at <a href="Southern%20Methodist%20University">Southern Methodist University</a>, earning a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in speech with a minor in journalism.

Starting in 1959, Altgens made occasional appearances as an actor and model in motion pictures, television and print advertising. Credited as James Altgens, he played Secretary Lloyd Patterson in the low-budget <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a> "<a href="Beyond%20the%20Time%20Barrier">Beyond the Time Barrier</a>" (1960); his role included the film's final line of dialogue. Altgens' acting career also included a role as a witness in "<a href="Free%2C%20White%20and%2021">Free, White and 21</a>" (1963), and as a witness (not as himself) in "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald%20%281964%20film%29">The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald</a>" (1964).

Altgens photographed President Kennedy for the AP in 1961 at Perrin Air Force Base. Kennedy and his predecessor <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> were traveling to <a href="Bonham%2C%20Texas">Bonham, Texas</a>, in November to attend the funeral of <a href="Sam%20Rayburn">Sam Rayburn</a>, three-time <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the United States House of Representatives</a>. Earlier that day, Altgens was the only photojournalist to climb to the 29th floor of the <a href="Mercantile%20National%20Bank%20Building">Mercantile National Bank Building</a> in Dallas to cover the rescue of a young girl from an elevator fire.

On November 22, 1963, Altgens was scheduled to work in the AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the "triple overpass" (the railroad bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of <a href="Dealey%20Plaza">Dealey Plaza</a>) to photograph the <a href="motorcade">motorcade</a> that was to take President Kennedy from <a href="Dallas%20Love%20Field">Love Field</a> to his scheduled appearance at the <a href="Dallas%20Market%20Center">Dallas Trade Mart</a>. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal <a href="single-lens%20reflex%20camera">single-lens reflex camera</a> rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.

Altgens tried to find a good <a href="camera%20angle">camera angle</a> on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private property and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the <a href="SS-100-X">presidential limousine</a> as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>. Altgens heard a loud noise at about the same time as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to <a href="Zapruder%20film">Zapruder film</a> frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.

As Altgens set up for a second photograph along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he recognized as gunfire, and saw that the President had been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance in my direction, I virtually became paralyzed. ... Yet, many news people say I should have taken the picture anyway ... I should have made the picture that I was set up to make. And I didn't do it."

Altgens recovered, and his next photograph showed the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a> with her hand on the vehicle's trunk lid and <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="Clint%20Hill%20%28Secret%20Service%29">Clint Hill</a> standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent on the back of the limousine.

After the gunshots ended, Altgens saw several armed men running up the grassy slope between Elm Street and the railroad tracks; he crossed the street toward the activity to see if he could get a picture of anyone being arrested. When they came back without a suspect, Altgens hurried back to the AP wirephoto office in the "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">Dallas Morning News</a>" building on Houston Street to file his report and have the film developed. He telephoned the news office, leading to one of the first news bulletins of the shooting:

Once his pictures had been distributed via the wirephoto network, Altgens was sent to <a href="Parkland%20Memorial%20Hospital">Parkland Memorial Hospital</a> along with a second photographer. Both stayed at Parkland until Kennedy's body was taken to <a href="Air%20Force%20One">Air Force One</a>, still at Love Field.

Altgens returned to Dealey Plaza to photograph the assassination site for diagramming purposes, then was sent to <a href="Dallas%20Municipal%20Building">Dallas City Hall</a> to retrieve the work of another AP photographer who had pictures of accused assassin <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> in custody. This was the only time he saw the suspect, and Altgens thought Oswald showed signs of having been thoroughly <a href="interrogation">interrogated</a>.

Ten days after Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas reported that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had captured the attention of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he would not have been able to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who said the man in the image was not Oswald but a different employee, Billy Nolan Lovelady. The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.

On May 24, 1964, six months after the shooting, the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" reported that Altgens—the man responsible for "probably the most controversial photograph of the decade", and one of the few people standing near the motorcade when Kennedy was shot—had not been questioned either by the FBI or by the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a>. A newspaper column printed in "<a href="Chicago%27s%20American">Chicago's American</a>" the following day made the same observation. FBI investigators interviewed Altgens eight days later, on June 2, 1964; he testified before the Warren Commission on July 22. By this time, Altgens was aware of the individual who resembled Oswald; Lovelady had been interviewed for the "Herald Tribune" article, and Altgens testified that he too had been contacted. He said there was nothing to share because he had not taken part in any assignments involving depository employees.

Commission representatives interviewed several depository workers in an effort to determine the identity of the man in Altgens' photograph; hearings included testimony from five people who said Lovelady was there, and from three others (including Lovelady) who directly identified him in the picture. Ultimately, the commission decided Oswald was not in the doorway.

In 1978, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Assassinations">House Select Committee on Assassinations</a> studied several still and motion images, including an enhanced version of the Altgens photograph, in the scope of its investigation. The committee also concluded that Lovelady was the man pictured in the depository doorway.

The official conclusions were still being debated by academics and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination%20conspiracy%20theories">conspiracy theorists</a> more than 50 years after the assassination. One such theorist, Texas author <a href="Jim%20Marrs">Jim Marrs</a>, wrote that most researchers were ready to accept Lovelady as the man in Altgens' photograph. He later wrote that others were resisting any such acceptance.

Altgens was featured in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote that he did not know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came from the other side of Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.

In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and was asked about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he believed them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.

When CBS television interviewed him in 1967, Altgens said it was obvious to him that the head shot came from behind Kennedy's limousine "because it caused him to bolt forward, dislodging him from this depression in the seat cushion". He added that the commotion across the street after the shooting struck him as odd, since he believed the assassin would have needed to move very quickly to get there.

<a href="district%20attorney">District Attorney</a> <a href="Jim%20Garrison">Jim Garrison</a> subpoenaed Altgens to appear in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Louisiana for the 1969 <a href="Clay%20Shaw%23Arrest%20and%20trial">trial of businessman Clay Shaw</a> on charges of conspiring to kill Kennedy. A check for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>300 was sent to cover the airfare, but Altgens did not want to go; he thought Garrison was acting in his own self-interest.

Altgens and former Texas Governor <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a> met by chance in Houston a short time later. Connally told Altgens that he also had been called to testify and received airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens later learned that they were not required to attend.

In 1979, after 40 years with the AP, Altgens retired rather than accept a transfer to a different bureau. He stayed in Dallas and took a job with the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> working on displays and exhibits. Altgens also spent time answering requests by assassination researchers, and his reminiscences were included in several publications and discussions:

Pictures of the Pain" and "That Day In Dallas

Starting in 1984, Altgens shared personal details and recollections in letters and telephone conversations for the book "<a href="Pictures%20of%20the%20Pain">Pictures of the Pain: Photography and the Assassination of President Kennedy</a>" (1994). His story would be expanded and highlighted for the 1998 follow-up "That Day In Dallas". In his correspondence, Altgens said he expected that some controversy over the details of the assassination would always exist, but those researchers who tried to sway him from the Warren Commission's conclusion (that Oswald, acting alone, killed Kennedy) had failed to do so.

Reporters Remember 11-22-63

In November 1993, Altgens took part in "Reporters Remember 11-22-63", a panel discussion at Southern Methodist University in Dallas including journalists who shared their experiences from 30 years before. Moderator <a href="Hugh%20Aynesworth">Hugh Aynesworth</a> introduced Altgens and reminded attendees of the controversy over the man in his picture who resembled Oswald.

Altgens described what he saw following the fatal shot to JFK. "There was no blood on the right-hand side of his face; there was no blood on the front of his face. But there was a tremendous amount of blood on the left-hand side and at the back of the head." This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should have seen some evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was trying to get away.

No More Silence

Altgens shared a story about Billy Lovelady for "No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy" (1998). Lovelady had contacted Altgens and asked him to deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.

Altgens also said he had told FBI agents that he might have had better pictures for investigators if he had been allowed to stay on the overpass. "By being up there, I would have been able to show the sniper."

On December 12, 1995, Ike and Clara Altgens were found dead in separate rooms in their home in Dallas. A "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" article quoted a nephew, Dallas attorney Ron Grant, as saying his aunt Clara had been very ill with heart trouble and other health problems, and both of them had long suffered from the <a href="influenza">flu</a>. <a href="Carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">Carbon monoxide poisoning</a> from a faulty <a href="furnace">furnace</a> may also have played a role in their deaths. Altgens was survived by three nephews, and his wife by two sisters.

Borodino-class battlecruiser

The Borodino"-class battlecruisers () were a group of four <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s ordered by the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Also referred to as the Izmail" class, they were <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> in late 1912 at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> for service with the <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>. Construction of the ships was delayed by a lack of capacity among domestic factories and the need to order some components from abroad. The start of World War I slowed their construction still further, as the imported components were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into areas more immediately useful for the war effort.

Three of the four ships were <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> in 1915 and the fourth in 1916. Work on the <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s lagged, and it became evident that Russian industry would not be able to complete the ships during the war. The <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> halted all work on the ships, which was never resumed. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> proposed to convert "Izmail", the ship closest to completion, to an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> in 1925, but the plan was cancelled after political manoeuvring by the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> led to funding not being available.

After the end of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1905, the <a href="Russian%20Naval%20General%20Staff">Russian Naval General Staff</a> decided that it needed a squadron of fast <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>s that could use their speed to engage the leader of an enemy's <a href="battle%20line">battle line</a>, as <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Admiral Tōgō</a> had done against the Russian fleet during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>. The Naval General Staff initially called for a ship with high speed (), guns, and limited protection (a <a href="Belt%20armor">waterline belt</a> of ). The <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>, head of the Russian government, approved construction of four such ships on 5 May 1911, but the <a href="State%20Duma%20%28Russian%20Empire%29">State Duma</a> session ended before the proposal could be voted on. Preliminary bids for the ships were solicited from private builders, but the bids proved to be very high, leading to a reconsideration of the requirements. The Naval General Staff issued a new specification on 1 July 1911 for a ship with a speed of only and with armour increased to . The armament was increased to nine guns in three non-<a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> triple-gun turrets, based on a false rumour that the Germans were increasing the calibre of the guns in their <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s. The Imperial Russian Navy believed that widely separating the main gun turrets and their <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazine">magazines</a> reduced the chance of a catastrophic ammunition explosion, reduced the <a href="silhouette">silhouette</a> of the ship and improved <a href="Ship%20stability">stability</a> without superfiring turrets and their tall <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28Russia%29">Naval Ministry</a> solicited new bids on 8 September from 23 shipbuilders, domestic and foreign, but only 7 responded, even after the deadline was extended by a month. Several designs were rejected for not meeting the revised criteria. In the meantime, the Artillery Section of the Main Administration of Shipbuilding had decided that it preferred a four-turret design, and new bids were solicited in May 1912 from the leading contenders from the first round of bidding. The eventual winner was a design by the <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyard">Admiralty Shipyard</a> in Saint Petersburg which had the extra turret added to a new hull section inserted into the original three-turret design.

The Duma approved construction in May 1912, before the design was finalised, and allocated 45.5 million <a href="ruble">ruble</a>s for each ship. The additional gun turret and consequent increase in the size of the ships led to the ships being overbudget by about 7 million rubles each, and some money was diverted from the budget for the to cover the discrepancy. Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the Admiralty Shipyard and the <a href="Baltic%20Shipyard">Baltic Works</a>, also of Saint Petersburg. The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916, and the second pair on 14 September 1916.

Full-scale armour <a href="Evaluation">trials</a> in 1913 revealed serious weaknesses in the "Borodino"s' proposed protection scheme. The obsolete <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a> was modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s, then under construction. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> and turret-roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was not strong enough to withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells. The design of the "Borodino"s' armour was similar in construction to that of the "Gangut"s and therefore needed to be modified, which slowed construction. The "Borodino"s' deck armour was reinforced with extra plates and the thickness of the turret roofs was increased. To compensate for this additional weight, a planned rear <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was removed entirely and the thickness of the main belt was slightly reduced. <a href="Mortise%20and%20tenon">Mortise and tenon</a> joints were introduced between the armour plates along their vertical edges to better distribute the shock of a shell impact and to lessen the stress on the supporting hull structure. The launching of the first pair of ships was postponed by six months because of these changes, plus delays imposed by the many ship orders already in hand.

The "Borodino"-class ships were long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. The ships <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> normally and at full load. <a href="High-tensile%20steel">High-tensile steel</a> was used throughout the hull with <a href="Carbon%20steel%23Mild%20and%20low%20carbon%20steel">mild steel</a> used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength. The hull was subdivided by 25 transverse watertight <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s and the engine room was divided by a longitudinal bulkhead. The <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> had a height of , and the vitals of the ship were protected by a triple bottom that added an extra of depth. The design called for a <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> of forward, amidships and aft. The ships were fitted with three Frahm <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23A">anti-rolling tanks</a> on each side.

The "Borodino"s were powered by four sets of <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving one <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>, using steam provided by 25 triangular <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s with a working pressure of . The turbines developed a total of and were designed to be overloaded to . The forward boilers were grouped into three compartments with three oil-fired boilers in each compartment. The rear boilers were in four compartments with each containing four coal-fired boilers fitted with oil sprayers to increase the burn rate. Maximum speed was estimated at 26.5 knots, although forcing the machinery would increase it to . The ships carried of <a href="coal">coal</a> and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave an estimated range of at full speed.

Sources disagree on the origin of the ships' propulsion machinery. Russian sources say that two sets of steam turbines were ordered on 22 April 1913 from the <a href="Franco-Russian%20Works">Franco-Russian Works</a> in Saint Petersburg for the Admiralty Shipyard-built ships, and that the Baltic Works built the turbines for its ships, using some components ordered from abroad. Western sources, however, state that Russia ordered entire turbines for "Navarin" from <a href="AG%20Vulcan%20Stettin">AG Vulcan</a>, and that they were seized after the start of the war for use in the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s. Given that the same Russian companies had built similar, albeit less powerful, turbines for the "Gangut" class, naval historian Stephen McLaughlin writes that it seems reasonable to assume that the Russian sources are correct—i.e. that turbine components ordered from Germany were incorporated into the German ships.

The "Borodino" class had six <a href="turbo%20generator">turbo generator</a>s and two <a href="diesel%20generator">diesel generator</a>s, each rated at . These were in four compartments on the platform deck, two each fore and aft of the boiler and <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>s. The generators powered a complex electrical system that combined <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> for most equipment with <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> for heavy-load machinery such as the turret motors.

The ships' primary armament consisted of a dozen 52-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> Model 1913 guns mounted in four electrically powered turrets. The turrets were designed to elevate and traverse at a rate of 3° per second. The guns had an <a href="elevation%20%28ballistics%29">elevation</a> range from −5° to +25°. They could be loaded at any angle between −5° and +15°; the expected rate of fire was three rounds per minute. A maximum of 80 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per gun could be carried. The guns fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of , with a maximum range of .

The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of twenty-four 55-calibre <a href="130%20mm/55%20B7%20Pattern%201913">Pattern 1913 guns</a> mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the <a href="hull%20%28ship%29">hull</a>, twelve per side. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of .

The <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> armament was intended to be four 38-calibre <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s fitted on the upper deck with 220 rounds carried for each gun. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Four guns were to be mounted in pairs on the main turret roofs for <a href="sub-calibre%20training">sub-calibre training</a> with the main guns. Six underwater <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were fitted, three on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>; they were provided with a total of eighteen torpedoes.

The fore and aft main gun turrets were given a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>, and there was another unit on top of the conning tower. These would provide data for the Geisler <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">central artillery post</a> <a href="analog%20computer">analog computer</a>, which would then transmit commands to the gun crew. The mechanical fire-control computer would have been either a <a href="Arthur%20Pollen">Pollen Argo</a> <a href="Vickers%20range%20clock">range clock</a>, which had been bought in 1913, or a domestically designed Erikson system.

The <a href="%23armor%20trials">trials with "Chesma"</a> greatly affected the armour protection design of the "Borodino"-class ships. The <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented-armour</a> plates were resized to match the frames and provide support for their joints; they were also locked together with mortise-and-tenon joints to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact. The <a href="Belt%20armour">waterline belt</a> covered the middle of the ship. It had a total height of , of which was above the design <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and below. The remaining portion of the waterline was protected by plates. The upper belt was thick and had a height of . It thinned to 75 millimetres forward of the casemates and extended all the way to the <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>. The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upward extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates. Those casemates were protected by 100-millimetre transverse bulkheads. Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was thick between the middle and lower decks and decreased to between the middle and upper decks. The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75 millimetres divided between a 50-millimetre plate of <a href="Krupp%20armour">Krupp non-cemented armour</a> (KNC) layered above a 25-millimetre <a href="nickel-steel">nickel-steel</a> plate. The forward end of the <a href="armoured%20citadel">armoured citadel</a> was protected separately and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75 millimetres thick. The rear bulkhead had no other protection and was thick between the middle and lower decks, decreasing to 75 millimetres at the level of the armour belt.

The main gun turrets were designed with 300-millimetre sides and 150-millimetre roofs. The <a href="gun%20port">gun port</a>s would have been protected by 50-millimetre plates with 25-millimetre bulkheads separating each gun inside the turrets. The barbettes were thick and decreased to when behind other armour. They were shaped like truncated cones which matched the trajectories of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value. The conning tower was thick and reduced to 300 millimetres below the upper deck. The <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> uptakes were protected by 50 millimetres of armour. The upper deck was thick and the middle deck consisted of plates of KNC on 25 millimetres of nickel-steel over the armoured citadel. Underwater protection was minimal: there was only a watertight bulkhead behind the upward extension of the double bottom, and this became thinner as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.

All four ships were officially laid down on 19 December 1912, and work began in March–April 1913. After a progress review on 4 June 1914, <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launching</a> of the first pair of ships was delayed until October. When World War I began in August, the hull of "Izmail" was judged as being 43 percent complete, the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused further delays as some components had been ordered from foreign manufacturers. For example, the gun turrets were intended to rest on <a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">roller bearings</a> made in Germany, but attempts to order replacements from the United Kingdom and Sweden proved futile, as no company was willing and able to make the bearings. The war caused other delays, including competition for scarce resources needed by other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, but it was clear that Russian industry would not be able to complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed by non-delivery of foreign-built components and a shortage of steel. They were reclassified as second rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916 and construction virtually stopped.

Various plans were made by the Naval General Staff and the Main Administration of Shipbuilding for the post-war completion of the ships, including modifying the turrets to load at a fixed angle of +4° to reduce the weight and complexity of the loading equipment. Another intended change was to lengthen the funnels by to minimise smoke interference with the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>, which had been a problem on the "Gangut"-class <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s. There were suggestions to improve the machinery with geared turbines, <a href="Turbo-electric%20transmission">turbo-electric drive</a>, or <a href="Hermann%20F%C3%B6ttinger">Föttinger's</a> hydraulic transmission, but these were more theoretical than practical.

After the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a>, the condition of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The ship that was furthest along was still "Izmail": her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65 percent complete, and her armour was 36 percent complete. Her turrets were not expected to be completed until 1919. The <a href="Congress%20of%20Shipyard%20Workers">Congress of Shipyard Workers</a> decided to continue work on the "Izmail" in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> halted all work on "Borodino", "Kinburn", and "Navarin" on 24 October 1917, and the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s ordered work on "Izmail" halted on 14 December 1917.

After the end of the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> was in sight by October 1921, the victorious Bolsheviks considered finishing "Izmail", and possibly "Borodino", to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of "Izmail"s turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by <a href="Vickers%20Limited">Vickers</a> before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects for more guns were not promising, given the poor state of Soviet heavy industry in the wake of the civil war. Another problem was their complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.

The Soviets also considered finishing "Kinburn" and "Navarin" to a modified design that featured guns; a two-gun turret weighed slightly less than a triple 354 mm gun turret. The proposal was rejected because the prospects of actually acquiring such guns were minimal. Domestic industry was incapable of building such large guns and the Soviets were not able to purchase the guns from any foreign company. Other ideas were examined for the three less complete ships. These included converting the hulls to <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a>s, <a href="passenger%20liner">passenger liner</a>s, or oil <a href="barge">barge</a>s, but the hulls were thought to be too large and unwieldy for the proposed uses. None of the proposals was accepted, and all three of the less complete ships were sold to a German company for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> on 21 August 1923 to raise much-needed cash for the government.

In May 1925, the Operational Administration of the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> contemplated converting "Izmail" into an aircraft carrier with a top speed of and a capacity of 50 aircraft. She would have been armed with eight guns and her armour reduced to a maximum of . This proposal was approved by <a href="Alexey%20Rykov">Alexey Rykov</a>, Chairman of the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Commissars">Council of the People's Commissars</a> on 6 July 1925, but the Red Army was strongly opposed to spending more money on naval projects. They managed to block the project by gaining control of a commission appointed to review the needs of the Navy in December, which cancelled the project on 16 March 1926. "Izmail" was scrapped beginning in 1931 in Leningrad.

The ships were named after battles fought by the Russian Empire:

Theodore Komnenos Doukas

Theodore Komnenos Doukas (, "Theodōros Komnēnos Doukas", <a href="latinisation%20of%20names">Latinized</a> as Theodore Comnenus Ducas, died 1253) was ruler of <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a> and <a href="Thessaly%23Late%20Medieval%20and%20Ottoman%20Thessaly">Thessaly</a> from 1215 to 1230 and of <a href="Empire%20of%20Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> and most of <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29%23Medieval%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Western%20Thrace%23History">western Thrace</a> from 1224 to 1230. He was also the power behind the rule of his sons <a href="John%20Komnenos%20Doukas">John</a> and <a href="Demetrios%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Demetrios</a> over Thessalonica in 1237–1246.

Theodore was the <a href="Lineal%20descendant">scion</a> of a distinguished <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> aristocratic family related to the imperial <a href="Komnenos">Komnenos</a>, <a href="Doukas">Doukas</a>, and <a href="Angelos">Angelos</a> dynasties. Nevertheless, nothing is known about Theodore's life before the <a href="Sack%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">conquest</a> of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> in 1204. Following the fall of Constantinople, he served <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore I Laskaris</a>, founder of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Empire of Nicaea</a>, for a few years before being called to Epirus, where his bastard half-brother <a href="Michael%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael I Komnenos Doukas</a> had founded an independent principality. When Michael died in 1215, Theodore sidelined his brother's underage and illegitimate son <a href="Michael%20II%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael II</a> and assumed the governance of the Epirote state. Theodore continued his brother's policy of territorial expansion. Allied with <a href="Medieval%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, he expanded into Macedonia, threatening the Latin <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Thessalonica">Kingdom of Thessalonica</a>. The capture of the <a href="Latin%20Emperor">Latin Emperor</a> <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Courtenay">Peter II of Courtenay</a> in 1217 opened the way to the gradual envelopment of Thessalonica, culminating in the city's fall in 1224.

As ruler of Thessalonica, Theodore quickly declared himself emperor, challenging the Nicaean emperor <a href="John%20III%20Doukas%20Vatatzes">John III Doukas Vatatzes</a>'s claims to the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Byzantine imperial throne</a>. In 1225, he advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople, but his final attack against the seat of the much-reduced Latin Empire was delayed until 1230. In that year, Theodore amassed an army to besiege Constantinople, but then diverted it against <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgaria</a>, an ambivalent ally which threatened his northern flank. Theodore was defeated and captured at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Klokotnitsa">Battle of Klokotnitsa</a>, and spent the next seven years in captivity. In the meantime, he was succeeded by his brother <a href="Manuel%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Manuel</a>. Manuel quickly lost <a href="Thrace%23Medieval%20history">Thrace</a>, most of Macedonia, and <a href="Medieval%20Albania">Albania</a> to the Bulgarian Tsar <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20II%20of%20Bulgaria">John II Asen</a>. Thessalonica itself became a Bulgarian <a href="vassal%20state">vassal</a>, while in Epirus proper power was seized by Michael II, returning from exile.

Theodore was released in 1237 when his daughter <a href="Irene%20Komnene%20Doukaina">Irene</a> married John Asen, and quickly managed to regain control of Thessalonica, ousting Manuel. Having been <a href="political%20mutilation%20in%20Byzantine%20culture">blinded</a> during his captivity and thus disqualified from occupying the throne again, he installed his eldest son John as emperor, but remained the "de facto" regent of the state. Manuel tried to regain Thessalonica with Nicaean support, but a negotiated settlement was reached which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes invited Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was welcomed and treated with great honour, but was effectively detained there until the spring of next year, when Vatatzes marched on Thessalonica with Theodore in tow. Theodore was sent in to negotiate with his son and convince him to accept demotion to the rank of <a href="Despot%20%28court%20title%29">Despot</a> and to recognize the <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> of Nicaea. John died in 1244 and was succeeded by Theodore's younger son Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes overthrew the unpopular Demetrios and annexed Thessalonica. Theodore influenced his nephew Michael II to launch an attack on Thessalonica in 1251, but in 1252, Vatatzes campaigned against them and forced Michael to come to terms. Theodore was taken prisoner and sent into exile in Nicaea, where he died around 1253.

Born between 1180 and 1185, Theodore was a son of the "<a href="sebastokrator">sebastokrator</a>" <a href="John%20Doukas%20%28sebastokrator%29">John Doukas</a> and of Zoe Doukaina. His paternal grandparents were <a href="Constantine%20Angelos">Constantine Angelos</a> and Theodora, a daughter of the Byzantine emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> (). Theodore's uncle, Andronikos, was the father of the emperors <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac II Angelos</a> () and <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios III Angelos</a> (), who were Theodore's first cousins. As with most members of his family, he preferred to use the surname of "Doukas" or "Komnenos Doukas" (Κομνηνὸς ὁ Δούκας); contemporaries variously called him "Doukas", "Komnenos", or even "Grand Komnenos" (μέγας Κομνηνός), an appellation more usually found among the ruling family of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a>. Theodore evidently preferred to be associated with the more successful dynasties of the <a href="Doukai">Doukai</a> and the <a href="Komnenoi">Komnenoi</a>, rather than the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire%20under%20the%20Angelos%20dynasty">disastrous reign</a> of the <a href="Angeloi">Angeloi</a>; indeed the only medieval writers to call him "Angelos" were the later, hostile pro-<a href="Palaiologos">Palaiologos</a> historians <a href="Nikephoros%20Gregoras">Nikephoros Gregoras</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Skoutariotes">Theodore Skoutariotes</a>, while <a href="George%20Akropolites">George Akropolites</a> refers to him as "Komnenos" until his defeat at Klokotnitsa in 1230 and as "Angelos" after.

Theodore's early life is obscure. After the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> <a href="Sack%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">captured</a> <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1204, he followed <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore Laskaris</a> to <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, where Laskaris founded the <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Empire of Nicaea</a>. Theodore's service under Laskaris is relatively unknown except for a brief reference in a letter written by the <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Corfu">Metropolitan of Corfu</a>, <a href="George%20Bardanes">George Bardanes</a>, one of Theodore's <a href="apologist">apologist</a>s. Bardanes writes that Theodore "took many dangers for his sake and wrested many fortresses from the enemies and subdued them to Laskaris' rule", distinguishing himself through his valour and receiving many rewards from the Nicaean ruler. Some modern scholars, such as <a href="Karl%20Hopf">Karl Hopf</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Bon">Antoine Bon</a>, have identified a certain Theodore, who appears as "lord of <a href="Argos">Argos</a>" and was the successor of <a href="Leo%20Sgouros">Leo Sgouros</a> in leading the resistance against the Crusaders in the northwestern <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> after Sgouros' death in 1208, with Theodore Komnenos Doukas. This view has been questioned by <a href="Raymond-Joseph%20Loenertz">Raymond-Joseph Loenertz</a>, who argues that there is no evidence for such an assumption, and that conversely it is well established that Theodore was in Nicaean service at the time.

Around 1210, Theodore was invited by his half-brother <a href="Michael%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael I Komnenos Doukas</a> to Epirus, where Michael had founded an <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">independent Greek principality</a>. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future <a href="Michael%20II%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael II Komnenos Doukas</a>, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers were considered to lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married <a href="Maria%20Petraliphaina">Maria Petraliphaina</a>, with whom he had four children.

From 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas was engaged in territorial expansion, chiefly at the expense of the Latin <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Thessalonica">Kingdom of Thessalonica</a> to his east; after initial reverses, much of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> was conquered. By 1214, <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a> and <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a>, but historian <a href="Philip%20Van%20Tricht">Philip Van Tricht</a> argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire <a href="%23Expansion%20against%20the%20Latin%20states%20of%20Greece">until 1217</a>. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. <a href="Theodora%20of%20Arta">Theodora of Arta</a>, the boy and his mother spent the duration of Theodore's reign exiled in the Peloponnese.

Theodore was capable and extremely ambitious. Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris, he aspired not only to expand his state at the expense of Thessalonica, but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> with himself as its ruler. To secure his northern flank, Theodore allied himself with <a href="Medieval%20Serbia">Serbia</a> and the <a href="Medieval%20Albania">Albanian clans</a>. The <a href="Principality%20of%20Arbanon">Principality of Arbanon</a> had already come in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I, and closer ties developed when its ruler, <a href="Dimitri%20Progoni">Demetrios</a>, died in 1215, leaving his principality to his widow, who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek <a href="magnate">magnate</a>, <a href="Gregory%20Kamonas">Gregory Kamonas</a>. Against the Serbs, Theodore abandoned Michael I's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into <a href="Zeta%20%28crown%20land%29">Zeta</a>, and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince <a href="Stefan%20II%20Nemanji%C4%87%20of%20Serbia">Stefan II Nemanjić</a> () that was directed towards keeping the <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarians</a> in check. The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore's brother <a href="Manuel%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Manuel Komnenos Doukas</a> to one of Stefan II's sisters . Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons—in all likelihood his eldest son and heir, <a href="Stefan%20Radoslav%20of%20Serbia">Stefan Radoslav</a>—to Michael I's second daughter Theodora. The <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Ohrid">Archbishop of Ohrid</a>, <a href="Demetrios%20Chomatianos">Demetrios Chomatianos</a>, refused to sanction the marriage due to <a href="Prohibited%20degree%20of%20kinship">consanguinity</a>—Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav's mother, <a href="Eudokia%20Angelina">Eudokia Angelina</a>, a daughter of Alexios III Angelos. In 1217, Stefan II tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as the groom to Theodora's half-sister Maria, but Chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds. Finally, Stefan Radoslav married Theodore's firstborn daughter <a href="Anna%20Angelina%20Komnene%20Doukaina">Anna</a> in winter 1219/20.

With his position thus strengthened, Theodore expanded his territory into northern <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, although it is possible that at least part of this region had already been captured by Michael I after the death of the local Bulgarian ruler <a href="Strez">Strez</a> in 1214. It is unclear to what extent Theodore's expansion involved direct conflict with the Bulgarian Tsar <a href="Boril%20of%20Bulgaria">Boril</a> (), but by 1217 he held <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, <a href="Prilep">Prilep</a>, and most of the plain of <a href="Pelagonia">Pelagonia</a>, at least up to Strez's old capital at <a href="Prosek">Prosek</a>, and likely beyond, approaching the <a href="Strymon%20River">Strymon River</a>. As the Greek historian Konstantinos Varzos has noted, the capture of Ohrid, seat of the eponymous archbishopric, was particularly important for the standing of the Epirote state and Theodore's aspirations. Theodore sponsored the election of the distinguished <a href="canonist">canonist</a> Chomatianos to the archiepiscopal throne in 1217, and Chomatianos would repay that support with his steadfast championing of Epirote claims to the Byzantine imperial inheritance vis-à-vis the rival claims of Nicaea.
Following the Fourth Crusade, the Orthodox clergy in the two main Greek states, Epirus and Nicaea, had effectively become separated. In 1208, the Nicaeans had convened a synod and elected <a href="Michael%20IV%20of%20Constantinople">Michael Autoreianos</a> as successor to the vacant see of the <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a>. The election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy. This in turn meant that Laskaris' imperial title was also open to challenge, as he had been crowned by the same Michael Autoreianos. Already under Michael I, two local synods of bishops had emerged in the Epirote domains to carry on administration of the Church, largely independent of the Patriarch, one at <a href="Naupaktos">Naupaktos</a> under <a href="John%20Apokaukos">John Apokaukos</a>, and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos. The more ambitious Chomatianos soon became the pre-eminent "western" bishop, and sought to strengthen the "de facto" Epirote autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs, including the appointment of bishops for the local sees without the Patriarch's interference. This policy, which dovetailed with Theodore's own ambitions of independence from and rivalry towards Nicaea, brought the two branches of the Greek Church to an open quarrel, as the Nicaea-based patriarch <a href="Manuel%20I%20Sarantenos">Manuel I Sarantenos</a> began appointing bishops of his own to Epirote sees, whom the Epirotes refused to accept. Despite his close ties to Epirus, Stefan II Nemanjić exploited the Epirote–Nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure <a href="autocephaly">autocephaly</a> for the <a href="Serbian%20Church">Serbian Church</a>, which traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ohrid. Brushing aside Chomatianos' vehement objections, Stefan managed to have his brother <a href="Saint%20Sava">Rastko, renamed Sava</a>, consecrated by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of Serbia in 1219. Theodore took care not to let the quarrels of the churchmen affect his cordial relations with the Serbian ruler.

Theodore's drive into Macedonia disquieted another local strongman, <a href="Alexius%20Slav">Alexius Slav</a>, ruler of <a href="Melnik%2C%20Bulgaria">Melnik</a>. A sworn enemy of Boril, Alexius had been abandoned by his erstwhile ally, the <a href="Latin%20Emperor">Latin Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20of%20Flanders">Henry of Flanders</a> (), who in 1213 allied himself with Bulgaria. Facing a possible attack by Theodore as well, Alexius now preferred to make common cause with him, and married a niece of Theodore's wife.

The Epirote successes in Macedonia worried the Latins, as they opened the way to another attack on Thessalonica. The Kingdom of Thessalonica had been much weakened after the death of its founder, <a href="Boniface%20of%20Montferrat">Boniface of Montferrat</a>, in 1207, since which it had been ruled by a regency for his underage son <a href="Demetrius%20of%20Montferrat">Demetrius</a> (). Interrupting a campaign against the Nicaeans in Asia Minor, Henry of Flanders hastened to Thessalonica. He took up contact with Boril and was preparing to march against Theodore when he suddenly died on 11 June 1216, probably of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, although poisoning by his second wife <a href="Maria%20of%20Bulgaria">Maria of Bulgaria</a> has also been suggested. The death of the warlike Henry, followed by that of <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>, the instigator of the Fourth Crusade, a month later, was a major stroke of good fortune for Theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents.
The barons of the Latin Empire then elected <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Courtenay">Peter II of Courtenay</a>, a cousin of King <a href="Philip%20II%20Augustus">Philip II Augustus</a> of France, as the new Latin Emperor. Receiving news of his election, Peter assembled a small army of 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, he set sail from <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a> in April 1217. Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which he had promised to conquer and return to Venice, while his wife <a href="Yolanda%20of%20Flanders">Yolanda of Flanders</a> sailed on to Constantinople. As in the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> invasion of <a href="William%20II%20of%20Sicily">William II of Sicily</a> () in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient <a href="Via%20Egnatia">Via Egnatia</a> to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote control in the process.

The commonly accepted version of events is that Dyrrhachium resisted with success, and as his casualties mounted Peter was forced to raise the siege and start his march towards Thessalonica. The march proved difficult, due to both the harsh terrain and the open hostility of the local population—the Western sources (the "<a href="Annales%20Ceccanenses">Annales Ceccanenses</a>", <a href="Richard%20of%20San%20Germano">Richard of San Germano</a>, <a href="Philippe%20Mouskes">Philippe Mouskes</a>, and the continuator of <a href="Robert%20of%20Auxerre">Robert of Auxerre</a>) also stress the loyalty of the local Albanian population to Theodore. After a few days, Theodore with his army confronted Peter. Theodore requested talks with the papal legate, <a href="Giovanni%20Colonna%20%28died%201245%29">Giovanni Colonna</a>, whom he assured of his goodwill and support. Western sources claim that Theodore offered to recognize the primacy of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and the suzerainty of the Latin Empire—as well as to support Peter in his planned participation in the <a href="Fifth%20Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a>—and offered the Latins food and guides through the mountains. Peter was glad to receive this unexpected help, and an agreement between the two was concluded. As soon as the Latins let their guard down, Theodore fell upon them. Peter of Courtenay, Colonna, the <a href="Latin%20Bishopric%20of%20Salona">Latin Bishop of Salona</a>, Count <a href="William%20I%20of%20Sancerre">William I of Sancerre</a>, and many Latin nobles were taken captive, while Peter's army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive. Akropolites, the chronicler <a href="Ephraim%20the%20Chronicler">Ephraim</a>, and some Western sources on the other hand claim that Dyrrhachium was captured, and are followed by some modern scholars, including the Greek <a href="I.%20D.%20Romanos">I. D. Romanos</a> and the French <a href="Alain%20Ducellier">Alain Ducellier</a>. According to this view, Theodore offered to acknowledge Peter's suzerainty after the city's fall, only to treacherously ambush and defeat him. As the historian <a href="John%20Van%20Antwerp%20Fine">John Van Antwerp Fine</a> remarks, "it is not important which version is correct"; the outcome was the same, and if lost, Dyrrhachium was quickly retaken after Peter's capture.

According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's actions were motivated by several factors, which led him to regard Peter as a threat to himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother <a href="William%20VI%20of%20Montferrat">William VI of Montferrat</a> over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin <a href="Principality%20of%20Achaea">Principality of Achaea</a>. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially in the aftermath of the mission of <a href="Pelagio%20Galvani">Cardinal Pelagius</a>, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.

Whatever the true course of events, Theodore's unexpected victory echoed throughout the Greek world, and greatly enhanced his standing; even the usually hostile Akropolites was forced to admit in his history that this feat was "of great help to the <a href="Rhomaioi">Romans</a>". Conversely it dismayed Pope Honorius, who sent letters to the Latin princes of Greece as well as the <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge of Venice</a> and Peter of Courtenay's son-in-law King <a href="Andrew%20II%20of%20Hungary">Andrew II of Hungary</a> (), urging them to engage themselves to secure the release of Peter and Colonna. He even wrote to Andrew and the French bishops to call for a crusade against Theodore, with which he also threatened Theodore in a letter. With the first contingents for the crusade assembling at <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> in late 1217, and the Venetians eager to profit from the crusade to recover Dyrrhachium, the pressure bore fruit: in March 1218, Colonna was released, with Theodore offering his apologies and assurances of loyalty to the Pope. Honorius then changed his policy to the point of forbidding the Doge of Venice to harm Theodore in the slightest, hoping thereby to secure the release of more prisoners. Although some of the lesser barons were freed, Peter and many of the most senior lords remained in captivity until their death. It is unknown when Peter of Courtenay died, but this was probably before September 1219.

The capture of Peter of Courtenay left both major Latin states in northern Greece, Thessalonica and Constantinople, in the hands of female regents. Before arriving in Constantinople, where she gave birth to Peter's posthumous son, <a href="Baldwin%20II%20of%20Constantinople">Baldwin II</a> (), Yolanda had stopped at the Peloponnese. There she quickly came to appreciate the wealth and strength of the Principality of Achaea, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Agnes to the principality's heir, <a href="Geoffrey%20II%20of%20Villehardouin">Geoffrey II of Villehardouin</a> (). A politically astute ruler, Yolanda also secured her eastern border by offering her daughter <a href="Maria%20of%20Courtenay">Maria of Courtenay</a> in marriage to Theodore Laskaris, who had just been widowed for the second time.

Before launching his final stroke against Thessalonica, Theodore also took care to secure his southern flank, by appointing his brother <a href="Constantine%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Constantine Komnenos Doukas</a> as governor in <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a> and <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>. An energetic governor, Constantine not only effectively shielded the Epirote domains from the threat of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a>, but soon recovered <a href="Neopatras">Neopatras</a> and <a href="Lamia%20%28city%29">Lamia</a> as well. Theodore himself turned his attention to clearing Thessaly of any remaining Latin presence, culminating in the surrender of the great <a href="Platamon%20Castle">Platamon Castle</a> in 1218. Over the next few years, one by one, Theodore captured the fortresses around Thessalonica itself. Platamon controlled the entrance to the <a href="Thermaic%20Gulf">Thermaic Gulf</a>, and with the surrender of <a href="Serres">Serres</a> in late 1221, Theodore cut the land connection between Constantinople and Thessalonica as well. Thessalonica was left thereby, in the words of John Fine, "more or less an island in the midst of Theodore's possessions".

As the fall of Thessalonica appeared imminent, Pope Honorius <a href="excommunicate">excommunicate</a>d Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a> () soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under <a href="Robert%20of%20Courtenay">Robert of Courtenay</a> (), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, <a href="John%20III%20Doukas%20Vatatzes">John III Doukas Vatatzes</a> (). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count <a href="Oberto%20II%20of%20Biandrate">Oberto II of Biandrate</a>, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the "de facto" regent, <a href="Guy%20Pallavicini">Guy Pallavicini</a>. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which had come to a standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore coming to terms with the Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poimanenon">Battle of Poimanenon</a>. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.

This double disaster destroyed the Pope's plans for the crusade, as he had envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army. At the same time, the prospective leader of the crusade, William VI of Montferrat, fell ill. In November, the Pope was forced to postpone the crusade's departure for the next spring. With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of the crusade, the exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224. The crusade to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at <a href="Halmyros">Halmyros</a>. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and the remnants of the army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.

The capture of Thessalonica, traditionally the second city of the Byzantine Empire after Constantinople, was a major stroke against the Latins and greatly boosted Theodore's standing, so much that he now regarded himself as superior to Vatatzes, and openly claimed the Byzantine imperial title by putting on the purple boots reserved to the emperor. Indeed, one of his major supporters, the eminent <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Naupaktos">Metropolitan of Naupaktos</a>, John Apokaukos, in a letter to the Patriarch in 1222 declared that the Epirotes already regarded Theodore as their "God-sent regent and emperor", and later wrote to Theodore's wife expressing the hope that he might be able to assist at their imperial coronation at Thessalonica.

According to Byzantine custom, the coronation of an emperor could only take place in Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now <a href="Germanus%20II%20of%20Constantinople">Germanus II</a>, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Thessalonica">Metropolitan of Thessalonica</a>, <a href="Constantine%20Mesopotamites">Constantine Mesopotamites</a>, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at <a href="Arta%2C%20Greece">Arta</a>, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform the coronation instead.

Although Theodore appears to have assumed, and was addressed by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar <a href="Lucien%20Stiernon">Lucien Stiernon</a> places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek <a href="Apostolos%20D.%20Karpozilos">Apostolos D. Karpozilos</a> rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. <a href="Eleni%20Bees-Seferli">Eleni Bees-Seferli</a> on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while <a href="Alkmini%20Stavridou-Zafraka">Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka</a> has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.

As befitted a Byzantine emperor, Theodore began setting up a court at his new capital, and dispensed the usual court titles to his relatives and followers. Not much is known about the men that staffed Theodore's regime; most of the available information comes from the writings of Chomatianos. Theodore's brothers Manuel and Constantine were raised to the rank of <a href="Despot%20%28court%20title%29">Despot</a>, the long-serving <a href="John%20Plytos">John Plytos</a> became "<a href="panhypersebastos">panhypersebastos</a>" and "<a href="mesazon">mesazon</a>" (chief minister), and a number of scions of old Byzantine aristocratic families, who had sought refuge in Epirus, were appointed as provincial governors alongside members of the local aristocracy. The title of "<a href="dux">doux</a>" was used, but unlike earlier times these were mostly civilian governors with little military authority. Theodore awarded titles with such largesse that formerly exclusive titles such as "<a href="sebastos">sebastos</a>" or "<a href="megalodoxotatos">megalodoxotatos</a>" were devalued and came to be held by city notables. His Nicaean rivals, notably Akropolites, mocked him for the haphazard way in which the titles were used and awarded, ignoring the old customs of Constantinople, as if he were "a Bulgarian or rather a barbarian". To secure his new capital, Theodore instituted a guard of "<a href="Tzakones">Tzakones</a>" under a "<a href="kastrophylax">kastrophylax</a>".
John Vatatzes initially reacted to Theodore's proclamation as emperor by offering to recognize him as a sort of viceroy in his lands, but Theodore rejected this and publicly assumed the full titulature of the Byzantine emperors, as ""<a href="basileus">basileus</a>" and "<a href="autokrator">autokrator</a>" of the Romans". Theodore's coronation deepened the rift between the western Greeks and Nicaea, which once again was expressed in the ecclesiastic sphere. At first, the Nicaeans tried to limit the blame to Chomatianos: though writing respectfully of Theodore himself, Patriarch Germanus II expressed his indignation at the presumption of Chomatianos in usurping the patriarchal privilege of crowning an emperor, while Chomatianos claimed that, as the successor of the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Justiniana%20Prima">ancient see</a> of <a href="Justiniana%20Prima">Justiniana Prima</a>, he was an independent prelate and had the authority to do so.

In 1227, a synod of Epirote bishops in Arta tried to find a compromise, acknowledging the overall authority of the Patriarch at Nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy, i.e. the right for Theodore to appoint bishops in his domains. They gave the Patriarch three months to reply, and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals, they might be forced to recognize the supremacy of the Pope instead. Germanus replied by having the patriarchal synod condemn Theodore's assumption of the imperial title. The conflict escalated when Germanus appointed his own candidate to the vacant see of Dyrrhachium. Theodore expelled the bishop, and the Epirote synod instead elected a friend of Chomatianos, <a href="Constantine%20Kabasilas">Constantine Kabasilas</a>, as the bishop. Germanus now attacked Theodore directly. In response, George Bardanes composed a letter to Germanus, which insisted on Epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged the very legality of Germanus' claims to the patriarchate. The result was a full schism between the Nicaean and Epirote churches that lasted until 1232/3.

Following Theodore's coronation, there were four rulers who claimed the imperial title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious <a href="John%20II%20Asen">John II Asen</a> (r. 1218–41) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself. Already in 1224, or at least in 1225, Theodore captured <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a> with <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a>, and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, seizing <a href="Kavala">Christopolis</a>, <a href="Xanthi">Xanthi</a>, <a href="Gratini">Gratianopolis</a>, <a href="Mosynopolis">Mosynopolis</a> and <a href="Didymoteicho">Didymoteicho</a>. In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the <a href="Evros%20River">Evros River</a> and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the "<a href="protostrator">protostrator</a>" <a href="John%20Ises">John Ises</a> and <a href="John%20Kammytzes">John Kammytzes</a>, was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.

The capture of Adrianople opened the path to Constantinople for Theodore. In order to secure his northern flank, he concluded an alliance with John Asen, sealed by the (second) marriage of his brother Manuel to Maria, an illegitimate daughter of Asen. At the same time, the Latins turned to Nicaea and concluded a peace treaty in exchange for further territorial concessions. This pact too was sealed by a marriage, of Theodore Laskaris' daughter Eudokia to the Latin baron <a href="Anseau%20de%20Cayeux">Anseau de Cayeux</a>. In the same summer of 1225, Theodore led his army to the environs of Constantinople, reaching the towns of <a href="Bizye">Bizye</a> and <a href="Vrysis">Vrysis</a>. Anseau de Cayeux, leading the Latin army, was heavily wounded in the clashes, but Constantinople itself was not attacked. Not only was Theodore unprepared for a siege against the mighty <a href="Theodosian%20Walls">Theodosian Walls</a>, but news of William of Montferrat's landing at Thessaly forced him to break off operations and return west.

For reasons that are unknown, Theodore did not renew his attack on Constantinople in 1226 or the years thereafter. Instead, he seems to have occupied himself with domestic affairs, as well as taking care to improve relations with Frederick II during the latter's stop-over at Corfu and <a href="Cephallonia">Cephallonia</a> to lead the <a href="Sixth%20Crusade">Sixth Crusade</a> in 1228. In 1229, he even sent a company of Greek troops to serve under Frederick in Italy. At the same time, Theodore presided over a rupture in relations with Venice, after his governor in Corfu sequestered the cargo of a shipwrecked Venetian ship. Theodore issued an edict on 19 August 1228 prohibiting Venetian merchants from practising commerce in his realm. In January of the same year, Robert of Courtenay died, leaving the throne of the Latin Empire to his eleven-year-old brother, Baldwin II. With a regency taking over the governance of the state, the Latin Empire stood further enfeebled. At this moment, John Asen offered an alliance. Baldwin II would marry his daughter Helena, while John Asen would take over the regency and lend his assistance at repelling Theodore's attacks. The Latin barons viewed the offer with mistrust, as it would offer John Asen every opportunity to take over Constantinople himself; instead, they strung out negotiations, and eventually chose the 80-year-old but energetic <a href="John%20of%20Brienne">John of Brienne</a> () as regent. Although the Bulgarian offer failed, it served to open a rift between Theodore and his nominal ally. In a move clearly directed against John Asen, in September 1228, Theodore agreed to a one-year truce with the Latin Empire's regent, <a href="Narjot%20de%20Toucy%20%28died%201241%29">Narjot of Toucy</a>, with the border between the two empires running along a line from <a href="Aenus%20%28Thrace%29">Ainos</a> to Vrysis.

Finally, in late 1229, Theodore began assembling his forces at Thessalonica—including a contingent of troops sent by Frederick II—for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed the Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this as a sign of Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely suggestion is that Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople. Although caught by surprise, John Asen reacted rapidly. Allegedly affixing the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Klokotnitsa">Battle of Klokotnitsa</a> was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.

In the aftermath of Klokotnitsa, Bulgaria emerged as the mightiest power in the Balkans. Deprived of its energetic ruler, Theodore's empire collapsed: within a few months Thrace, most of Macedonia, and Albania, fell under Bulgarian rule. As John Asen boasted in an inscription in the <a href="Holy%20Forty%20Martyrs%20Church%2C%20Veliko%20Tarnovo">Holy Forty Martyrs Church</a> at his capital of <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Tarnovo</a>, he "occupied all the land from Adrianople to Dyrrhachium, Greek, Serbian, and Albanian alike", although Dyrrhachium itself apparently remained in Greek hands. The Latin <a href="Duchy%20of%20Philippopolis">Duchy of Philippopolis</a> was also annexed, and Alexius Slav's principality in the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a> was extinguished in the process, with Alexius spending the rest of his life at Asen's court.

Theodore's brother Manuel, who managed to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs of the city and his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania recognized his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to all intents and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently with the support of the local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the "<a href="fait%20accompli">fait accompli</a>" under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.

Theodore himself remained in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially he was treated with honour, but at some point during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and <a href="political%20mutilation%20in%20Byzantine%20culture">blinded</a> as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, <a href="Irene%20Komnene%20Doukaina">Irene</a>. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.

As soon as he was set free, Theodore returned to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son <a href="John%20Komnenos%20Doukas">John Komnenos Doukas</a> () as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.

The deposed Manuel was sent to exile at <a href="Attaleia">Attaleia</a> in Asia Minor, while his wife Maria was allowed to return to her father. Despite Theodore's actions and the overthrow of his daughter and son-in-law, Akropolites reports that John Asen remained favourably disposed towards Theodore due to his passionate love for Irene. Manuel did not remain quiescent in exile; determined to avenge himself, from Attaleia he secured passage through Turkish lands to Nicaea. There John Vatatzes welcomed him and agreed to support him, but not before he secured from Manuel oaths of loyalty to himself. Thus in early 1239 Manuel with six Nicaean ships set sail for Greece, landing near <a href="Demetrias">Demetrias</a> in Thessaly. He received widespread support in the province, perhaps even from the local governor, Michael I's son-in-law <a href="Constantine%20Maliasenos">Constantine Maliasenos</a>, allowing him to raise an army and in a short time occupy <a href="Farsala">Farsala</a>, <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>, and Platamon. Faced with the option of open civil war, Manuel and Theodore eventually came to terms by dividing the territories of Thessalonica among themselves. Manuel renounced his allegiance to Vatatzes and received Thessaly, John and Theodore kept Thessalonica and the remaining parts of Macedonia as far west as <a href="Vodena">Vodena</a> and <a href="Arnissa">Ostrovo</a>, and Constantine was confirmed in his <a href="appanage">appanage</a> of Aetolia and Acarnania. To further secure their position, both Theodore and Michael concluded treaties with the powerful Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey II of Villehardouin.

Michael II in Epirus was not part of the brothers' agreement, and continued to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael moved quickly to occupy Thessaly. In June of the same year, John Asen died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son <a href="Kaliman%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Kaliman</a> (r. 1241–46). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.

Before undertaking any moves against Constantinople, Vatatzes realized the need to settle affairs with Thessalonica, and in particular with Theodore, whose ambition, capability, and machinations he feared. In 1240 or 1241 he therefore issued an invitation, with assurances of safe-conduct, to Theodore to visit Nicaea. Theodore accepted, and was treated with great honours by Vatatzes, who deferred to him as his "uncle" and dined with him at the same table. In reality, Theodore was a prisoner in Nicaea; he was not allowed to leave, and throughout his sojourn in the Nicaean court, preparations were in full swing for a campaign against Thessalonica. In spring 1242, Vatatzes crossed over into Europe at the head of his army, with Theodore accompanying him as an honorary prisoner. Facing no resistance, the Nicaean army and fleet arrived before Thessalonica. The city's garrison and inhabitants resisted with success and the Nicaean army, lacking heavy siege equipment, had to settle for a drawn-out blockade. Soon, however, news arrived of a <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6se%20Da%C4%9F">invasion of Asia Minor</a>, which forced Vatatzes to break off the campaign and return to Nicaea. Nevertheless, the Nicaean emperor kept this news a secret, and sent Theodore to his son to negotiate. John himself reportedly was willing to surrender the city outright, but his father convinced him to hold out for better terms. In the end, after 40 days of negotiations, John was allowed to keep control of Thessalonica, but renounced his imperial title and accepted Nicaean suzerainty and the title of Despot. Theodore was also allowed to remain at Thessalonica at his son's side.

John ruled as Despot in Thessalonica for two years, until his death in 1244. Theodore himself retired to Vodena, from where he supervised the affairs of state. On John's death he raised his younger son <a href="Demetrios%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Demetrios Komnenos Doukas</a> () in his place, and sent an embassy to Nicaea to announce the succession, as befitted the terms of vassalage agreed in 1242. If John was a religious ascetic, Demetrios was a dissolute youngster who enjoyed partying with his favourites and seducing married women. Although Theodore remained in charge of governance, Demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct Nicaean rule with favour.

Things came to a head in autumn 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria died, leaving the country in the hands of a regency for his younger brother <a href="Michael%20Asen%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Asen</a> (). Vatatzes quickly attacked Bulgaria, and within three months captured most of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus also took advantage of the opportunity to expand into Albania and northwestern Macedonia. At the close of this campaign in November, as Vatatzes was encamped at Melnik, he was informed of a conspiracy to depose Demetrios and deliver Thessalonica to him in exchange for a <a href="chrysobull">chrysobull</a> guaranteeing the traditional rights and privileges of the city. Vatatzes readily granted this, and sent envoys to Demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' intentions, refused, and the Nicaeans marched on Thessalonica. After a few days, the conspirators opened one of the gates to the Nicaean army, and the city was quickly captured. Demetrios was captured and exiled to <a href="Lentiana">Lentiana</a> in <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>, while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were placed under the governance of the <a href="Grand%20Domestic">Grand Domestic</a> <a href="Andronikos%20Palaiologos%20%28megas%20domestikos%29">Andronikos Palaiologos</a>. Theodore himself, isolated and without power in his refuge at Vodena, apparently remained uninvolved in these events.

With Thessalonica secured, Vatatzes turned to Epirus, offering Michael II a marriage alliance between Michael's eldest son <a href="Nikephoros%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Nikephoros</a> and his own granddaughter Maria. The offer was enthusiastically accepted by Michael's wife, <a href="Theodora%20Petraliphaina">Theodora Petraliphaina</a> (a niece of Theodore's own wife), and the young couple were engaged at <a href="Pegae">Pegae</a>. Michael, who had not abandoned his family's ambitions, remained ambivalent about the Nicaean alliance, and Theodore used his influence over his nephew to turn him against it. Thus, in spring 1251, Michael launched a sudden attack on Thessalonica. The city resisted successfully, and in spring of the next year Vatatzes once more crossed into Europe to campaign against the Komnenoi Doukai. Theodore with Michael had turned to the north, capturing Prilep and <a href="Veles%20%28city%29">Veles</a>, and when they received news of Vatatzes' arrival, they withdrew to Epirus via <a href="Kastoria">Kastoria</a>. Vatatzes besieged and captured Theodore's stronghold of Vodena, but soon became bogged down in skirmishing in the area of Kastoria. The stalemate was broken when two Epirote generals, <a href="John%20Glabas">John Glabas</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Petraliphas">Theodore Petraliphas</a>, defected to the Nicaeans, followed shortly after by the ruler of <a href="Kruja">Kruja</a>, <a href="Golem%20of%20Kruja">Golem</a>. This forced Michael to come to terms with Vatatzes, ceding the fortresses he had captured as well as his remaining holdings in Macedonia, and reconfirming the marriage alliance with Nicaea. Furthermore, Vatatzes explicitly demanded the handing over of Theodore. The Epirote ambassadors met Vatatzes at Vodena, where they offered Theodore and the young Nikephoros as hostages. The latter was granted the title of Despot and soon allowed to return to Epirus, but Theodore was moved as a prisoner to Asia Minor. He died shortly after, around 1253.

The modern biographer of the Komnenoi, Konstantinos Varzos, described Theodore as an "energetic, resourceful, and exceedingly ambitious statesman, who inherited from his ancestor Alexios I Komnenos his endurance and persistence, but not the latter's intelligence, diplomacy, and ability to adapt". Varzos furthermore points out that despite his great ability, Theodore's ambition to be the one to recover Constantinople and his irreconcilable rivalry with Nicaea actually hampered and delayed the restoration of the Byzantine Empire by several decades.

Theodore's legacy left a lasting mark on the political worldview of the western Greeks: Byzantinist <a href="Donald%20Nicol">Donald Nicol</a> remarks that "the memory of Theodore Doukas's victories and of his title to the Byzantine crown lived on in northern Greece and in the hearts of his descendants for many years to come". Michael II continued his uncle's rivalry with Nicaea, further delaying the recovery of Constantinople, and even after the restoration of the Byzantine Empire by Nicaea in 1261, the rulers of Epirus would continue to challenge the revived empire and uphold their own claim to the Byzantine throne.

By his wife Maria Petraliphaina, Theodore had four children:

Mormon handcart pioneers

The Mormon handcart pioneers were participants in the <a href="human%20migration">migration</a> of members of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church) to <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, who used <a href="Cart">handcarts</a> to transport their belongings. The Mormon handcart movement began in 1856 and continued until 1860.

Motivated to join their fellow church members in Utah, but lacking funds for full teams of <a href="ox">oxen</a> or <a href="horse">horse</a>s, nearly 3,000 <a href="Mormon%20pioneers">Mormon pioneers</a> from <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> made the journey from <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> or <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> to Utah in ten handcart companies. The trek was disastrous for two of the companies, which started their journey dangerously late and were caught by heavy snow and severe temperatures in central <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. Despite a dramatic rescue effort, more than 210 of the 980 pioneers in these two companies died along the way. John Chislett, a survivor, wrote, "Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death."

Although fewer than 10 percent of the 1846–68 <a href="Latter-day%20Saint">Latter-day Saint</a> emigrants made the journey west using handcarts, the handcart pioneers have become an important symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation. They continue to be recognized and honored in events such as <a href="Pioneer%20Day%20%28Utah%29">Pioneer Day</a>, church pageants, and similar commemorations.

The <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saints</a> were first organized in 1830. Early members of the church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs. Their neighbors felt threatened by the church's rapid growth in numbers, its tendency to vote as a <a href="voting%20bloc">bloc</a> and acquire political power, its claims of divine favor, and, later, the practice of <a href="plural%20marriage">polygamy</a>. Violence directed against the church and its members caused the body of the church to move from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> to <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, then to <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Despite the frequent moves, church members were unable to escape opposition, which culminated in the <a href="Missouri%20Executive%20Order%2044">extermination order</a> against all Mormons living in the state by Missouri Governor <a href="Lilburn%20Boggs">Lilburn Boggs</a> in 1838 and the <a href="Death%20of%20Joseph%20Smith">death</a> of their leader <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> in 1844. <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a> said that he had received divine direction to organize the church members and head beyond the western frontier of the United States.

Soon after the first Mormon pioneers reached Utah in 1847, the church began encouraging its converts in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and elsewhere in Europe to <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">emigrate</a> to Utah. From 1849 to 1855, about 16,000 European <a href="Latter-day%20Saints">Latter-day Saints</a> traveled to the United States by ship, through the eastern states by rail, and to Utah by ox and wagon. Although most of these emigrants paid their own expenses, the church established the <a href="Perpetual%20Emigration%20Fund">Perpetual Emigration Fund</a> to provide financial assistance for poor emigrants to trek west, which they would repay as they were able. Contributions to expand the fund were encouraged.

When contributions and loan repayments dropped off in 1855 after a poor harvest in Utah, Young decided to begin using handcarts because the church members who remained in Europe were mostly poor. Young also believed it would speed the journey.

Young proposed the plan in a letter to <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Richards%20%28Mormon%20apostle%29">Franklin D. Richards</a>, <a href="Mission%20president">president</a> of the European <a href="Mission%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Mission</a>, in September 1855. Young's letter was published in the "<a href="Millennial%20Star">Millennial Star</a>", the church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response was overwhelming – in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.

Emigrants departed from an English port (generally <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>) and travelled by ship to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> or <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>, then by railroad to <a href="Iowa%20City%2C%20Iowa">Iowa City, Iowa</a>, the western terminus of the rail line, where they would be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.
Built to Young's design, the handcarts resembled a large <a href="wheelbarrow">wheelbarrow</a>, with two wheels in diameter and a single axle wide, and weighing . Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9 m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9 m by 1.2 m), with walls. The handcarts generally carried up to of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as . Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.

The handcart companies were organized using the handcarts and sleeping tents as the primary units. Five people were assigned per handcart, with each individual limited to of clothing and bedding. Each round tent, supported by a center pole, housed 20 occupants and was supervised by a tent captain. Five tents were supervised by the captain of a hundred (or "sub-captain"). Provisions for each group of one hundred emigrants were carried in an ox wagon, and were distributed by the tent captains.

The first two ships departed England in late March and mid-April and sailed to Boston. The emigrants spent several weeks in Iowa City, where they constructed their handcarts and were outfitted with supplies before beginning their trek of about .
About 815 emigrants from the first two ships were organized into the first three handcart companies, headed by captains <a href="Edmund%20Ellsworth">Edmund Ellsworth</a>, Daniel D. McArthur, and <a href="Edward%20Bunker%20%28Mormon%29">Edward Bunker</a>. The captains were <a href="Mormon%20missionary">missionaries</a> returning to their homes in Utah and were familiar with the route. Most of the sub-captains were also returning missionaries.

Across Iowa they followed an existing road about to <a href="Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa">Council Bluffs</a>, following a route that is close to current <a href="U.S.%20Route%206">U.S. Route 6</a>. After crossing the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>, they paused for a few days at a <a href="Winter%20Quarters%2C%20Nebraska">Mormon outpost</a> in <a href="Florence%2C%20Nebraska">Florence, Nebraska</a> (now part of <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a>), for repairs, before beginning the remaining journey along the <a href="Mormon%20Trail">Mormon Trail</a> to Salt Lake City.

Initial problems with the carts occurred because the wood used to construct them was said to have been "green timber", with many more breakdowns than anticipated. When the first handcart company reached Winter Quarters, Edmund Ellsworth had a member of the company "tin" the wooden axles and also installed "thick hoop iron skeins" which enabled the handcart axles to turn more easily and resist breakage much better. This feature became a standard part of handcarts in following years, including frequent greasing to keep the wheels lubricated. With no method of communicating back up the trail, however, this needed set of fixes did not reach the fourth and fifth companies in time.

The companies made good time, and their trips were largely uneventful. The emigrant companies included many children and elderly individuals, and pushing and pulling handcarts was difficult work. Journals and recollections describe periods of illness and hunger. Like other companies traveling on the <a href="Emigrant%20Trail">Emigrant Trail</a>, deaths occurred along the way. Hafen and Hafen's "Handcarts to Zion" lists 13 deaths from the first company, seven from the second, and fewer than seven from the third. Journal entries reflect the optimism of the handcart pioneers, even amid their hardships:

The first two companies arrived in Salt Lake City on September 26 and the third followed less than a week later. The first three companies were regarded as having demonstrated the feasibility of emigrating using handcarts.

The last two handcart companies of 1856 departed late from England. The ship "Thornton", carrying the emigrants who became the Willie Company, did not leave England until May 4. The leader of the Latter-day Saints on the "Thornton" was <a href="James%20G.%20Willie">James G. Willie</a>. Another eleven days passed before the "Horizon," departed, carrying the emigrants who later formed the Martin Company. The late departures may have been the result of difficulties in procuring ships in response to the unexpected demand, but the results would be tragic.

With slow communications in the era before the transatlantic telegraph, the church's agents in Iowa City were not expecting the additional emigrants and had to make frantic preparations for their arrival. Critical weeks were spent hastily assembling the carts and outfitting the companies. When the companies reached Florence, additional time was lost making repairs to the poorly built carts. Emigrant John Chislett describes the problems with the carts:

Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, <a href="Levi%20Savage%20Jr.">Levi Savage</a>, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church <a href="Elder%20%28Mormonism%29">elders</a> argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by <a href="miracle">divine intervention</a>. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.

Near <a href="Wood%20River%2C%20Nebraska">Wood River</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, a herd of <a href="American%20bison">bison</a> caused the Willie Company's cattle to <a href="stampede">stampede</a>, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional of flour.

In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's <a href="mission%20president">mission president</a>, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants.

In early October the two companies reached <a href="Fort%20Laramie%20National%20Historic%20Site">Fort Laramie</a>, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were pre-stocked for them. The companies cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.
On October 4, the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with Brigham Young and other church leaders. The next morning the church was meeting in a <a href="General%20Conference%20%28LDS%20Church%29">general conference</a>, where Young and the other speakers called on church members to provide wagons, <a href="mule">mule</a>s, supplies, and <a href="teamster">teamster</a>s for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7, the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, and by the end of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.

Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin companies were running out of food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19, a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the <a href="Sweetwater%20River%20%28Wyoming%29">Sweetwater River</a> approaching the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a>. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them a small amount of flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20, Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near <a href="South%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">South Pass</a> that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.

On October 19, the Martin Company was about further east, making its last crossing of the <a href="North%20Platte%20River">North Platte River</a> near present-day <a href="Casper%2C%20Wyoming">Casper, Wyoming</a>. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> or <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a> after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at <a href="Devil%27s%20Gate%20%28Wyoming%29">Devil's Gate</a>, where they had been instructed to wait for the rest of the rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of <a href="Joseph%20Angell%20Young">Joseph Young</a>, Abel Garr, and <a href="Daniel%20Webster%20Jones%20%28Mormon%29">Daniel Webster Jones</a> was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. During this interval, the party was providentially met by <a href="Ephraim%20Hanks">Ephraim Hanks</a>, bringing meat from a recently slaughtered buffalo, likely saving many lives as the nutritive value of the protein and fat in the meat was much higher than that of the exhausted flour supplies, etc. He also performed many blessings and helped in some amputations, etc. to stop the progression of the frostbite and gangrene that would have otherwise killed more members of the company. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.

George D. Grant, who headed the rescue party, reported to Young:

At Devil's Gate the rescue party unloaded the baggage carried in the wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons could be used to transport the weakest emigrants. A small group, led by Daniel Webster Jones, remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days; the company moved into <a href="Martin%27s%20Cove">Martin's Cove</a>, a few miles west of Devil's Gate, as it was much more protected than the open plains just to the east. This is where the famous crossing of the Sweetwater River on November 4 occurred (see more information below). During this season, the River, though shallow – about – was also wide. The stream temperature was frigid and clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across.

The rescue parties escorted the emigrants from both companies to Utah through more snow and severe weather while their members continued to suffer death from disease and exposure. The Willie Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 9; 68 members of the company had lost their lives.

Meanwhile, a backup relief party of 77 teams and wagons was making its way east to provide additional assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger the leaders of the backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18, the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last all the members of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.

After the companies arrived in Utah, the residents generously opened their homes to the arriving emigrants, feeding and caring for them over the winter. The emigrants would eventually go on to Latter-day Saint settlements throughout Utah and the West.

One of the most persistent and popular stories regarding the Mormon pioneers was about three of the rescuers who helped the pioneers cross Sweetwater River. The most popular telling, by Solomon Kimball, states:

This version was quoted by <a href="Gordon%20B.%20Hinckley">Gordon B. Hinckley</a>, <a href="James%20E.%20Faust">James E. Faust</a> and was previously taught in <a href="Sunday%20School%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Sunday School</a> in the LDS Church for both adults and children.

Chad Orton notes it would be physically impossible for three boys to carry five hundred people across the river in two hours. In actuality, the rescue party had several rescuers instead of three, eighteen of which have been positively identified as being at the Sweetwater crossing. The rescuers brought ten rescue wagons in addition to the wagons the Martin Company had with them. Many survivors wrote about riding the wagons across. However, because of time constraints, not everyone could ride the wagons. Some were carried, but other survivors wrote that they crossed the river themselves or with the help of people other than the three boys. The boys mentioned in the story did help some people across, but not "nearly every member" as reported in the mythologized version of the story. While the three boys were among those that helped several across, the ages were wrong. C. Allen Huntington was 24, David P. Kimball was 17, and George W. Grant was 16. There is no medical evidence that they died from effects of the crossing, and most lived active and relatively long lives. Outside of Kimball's account, there is no other account of Brigham Young promising everlasting salvation to the rescuers based on a single act. Orton notes that such a promise is inconsistent with church doctrine. John Thomas notes that Solomon Kimball did not witness the crossing, but relied heavily on other sources, particularly <a href="Orson%20F.%20Whitney">Orson F. Whitney</a>'s 1888 account, who also claimed that all of the boys died from the event, even though Huntington was still alive in 1888.

Another common myth is that none of the survivors of the Willie or Martin handcart companies ever complained and they never apostatized from the church. The most popular source came from William Palmer, who paraphrased a comment Francis Webster had made in a Sunday School class in Cedar City. He writes:

This was later quoted by <a href="David%20O.%20McKay">David O. McKay</a> in 1948, and later by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and was taught to children. However, several people in the Willie or Martin handcart companies did leave the church, including John Chislett, John Ahmanson, Elizabeth Sermon, Henry Augustus Squires, Henry Kemp and Deborah Jane Chapman. Many of the survivors complained.

Palmer gave the quote during a radio series of "Men You Should Know" describing the life of Webster about forty years after Webster died. Palmer said that he was paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given.

American West historian, <a href="Wallace%20Stegner">Wallace Stegner</a>, described the inadequate planning and improvident decisions leading to the tragedy when he wrote,

As early as November 2, 1856, while the Willie and Martin companies were still making their way to safety, Brigham Young responded to criticism of his own leadership by rebuking Franklin Richards and Daniel Spencer for allowing the companies to leave so late. However, many authors argued that Young, as author of the plan, was responsible. <a href="Ann%20Eliza%20Young">Ann Eliza Young</a>, daughter of one of the men in charge of building the carts and a former plural wife of Brigham Young, described her ex-husband's plan as a "cold-blooded, scheming, blasphemous policy". Stegner described Richards as a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a> for Young's fundamental errors in planning, though Howard Christy, professor emeritus and former senior editor of scholarly publications at <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> (BYU), noted that Richards, as the highest-ranking official in Florence, Nebraska area, was, in fact, the official who would have had the authority and capability to have averted the tragedy by halting their late departure. Christy also pointed out that Brigham Young and the other members of the church's <a href="First%20Presidency%20%28LDS%20Church%29">First Presidency</a> had consistently pointed out that departure from what is now Omaha, Nebraska needed to happen by the end of May to safely make the journey.

Many survivors of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody ... I have no doubt that those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that "we should get to Zion in safety."

In May 2006, a panel of researchers at the annual conference of the <a href="Mormon%20History%20Association">Mormon History Association</a> blamed the tragedy on a failure of leadership. Lyndia Carter, a <a href="Mormon%20Trail">trails</a> historian, said Franklin D. Richards "was responsible, in my mind, for the late departure" because "he started the snowball down the slope" that eventually "added up to disaster". Christy agreed that "leadership from the top, from the outset, was seriously short of the mark." Robert Briggs, an attorney, said "It's almost a foregone conclusion ... there is evidence of negligence. With leaders all the way up to Brigham Young, there was mismanagement." On the other hand, Rebecca Bartholomew and <a href="Leonard%20J.%20Arrington">Leonard J. Arrington</a> wrote, "Memories of what was perhaps the worst disaster in the history of western migration have been palliated by what could also be regarded as the most heroic rescue of the Mormon frontier."

A number of lessons had been learned from the 1856 disaster that allowed the church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.

By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; almost all of the handcart emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's <a href="Utah%20War">Utah Expedition</a>, on its way to Utah to enforce federal authority over Young and the Latter-day Saints, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.

With the uncertainty caused by the <a href="Utah%20War">Utah War</a>, the church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to <a href="Saint%20Joseph%2C%20Missouri">Saint Joseph, Missouri</a>, after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough <a href="mountain%20man">mountain men</a> fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another version of the story in which two young women married two mountain men.) The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the <a href="Green%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">Green River</a>. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.

The last two handcart companies made the journey in 1860, again following the route through St. Joseph. Although the journey proved to be difficult for the emigrants, these companies had relatively uneventful trips and experienced little loss of life.

After 1860 handcarts were no longer used. The church implemented a new system of emigration, in which wagon trains travelled east from Salt Lake City in the spring and returned with emigrants in the summer. The <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">transcontinental railroad</a> was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip.

Handcart pioneers and the handcart movement are important parts of <a href="Culture%20of%20The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">LDS culture</a>, <a href="Mormon%20music">music</a> and <a href="LDS%20fiction">fiction</a>. Arthur King Peters described the importance of this part of Mormon history in "Seven Trails West":
Wallace Stegner praised the examples of those of the handcart companies, particularly in comparison to other pioneer parties:

<a href="Historical%20reenactment">Reenactments</a>, in which a group dressed in 19th-century garb travels for one or more days pushing and pulling handcarts, have become a popular activity among LDS <a href="ward%20%28LDS%20Church%29">wards</a>, youth groups, and families.

The first known modern-era reenactment took place in 1966 from <a href="Henefer%2C%20Utah">Henefer, Utah</a>, to the mouth of <a href="Emigration%20Canyon">Emigration Canyon</a> by young men from <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, using handcarts between metal wheels repurposed from old farm wagons. In 1968, 44 girls from <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> reenacted that same stretch of the Mormon Trail with homemade handcarts. From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, participation in handcart reenactments were offered at BYU in a program, spearheaded by Doug Cloward, that was a <a href="wilderness%20survival">wilderness survival</a> activity for <a href="BYU%20Division%20of%20Continuing%20Education%23Conferences%20and%20workshops">youth conference</a> participants. Beginning in 1977, similar treks were offered as part of <a href="Ricks%20College">Ricks College</a>'s <a href="outdoor%20recreation">outdoor recreation</a> program, on connected <a href="jeep%20trail">jeep trail</a>s from <a href="Rexburg%2C%20Idaho">Rexburg, Idaho</a> and into <a href="Montana">Montana</a>.

The reenactments have been lauded by LDS leaders; for example, <a href="M.%20Russell%20Ballard">M. Russell Ballard</a> of the <a href="Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a> said, "Through music, drama, and stirring reenactments, we will be reminded of incredible pioneer journeys, both temporal and spiritual." The reenactments have become so popular that the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> is studying the impact on the trail and its environment, especially in the area around Rocky Ridge, Wyoming. According to the "<a href="Casper%20Star-Tribune">Casper Star-Tribune</a>", the BLM has had to impose a fee to offset the costs of monitoring the impacts of reenactors and other campers on the trail.

A re-creation of the 1856 handcart disaster was featured on the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a> show, "<a href="Wild%20West%20Tech">Wild West Tech</a>".

A number of events were held during 2006 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 1856 handcart companies:

Hoopoe starling

The hoopoe starling ("Fregilupus varius"), also known as the Réunion starling or Bourbon crested starling, is a species of <a href="starling">starling</a> which lived on the <a href="Mascarene%20island">Mascarene island</a> of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, and became <a href="extinct">extinct</a> in the 1850s. Its closest relatives were the <a href="Rodrigues%20starling">Rodrigues starling</a> and the <a href="Mauritius%20starling">Mauritius starling</a> from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought to be related to the <a href="hoopoe">hoopoe</a>, from which its name is derived. Although a number of affinities have been proposed, it was confirmed as a starling in a <a href="DNA">DNA</a> study.

The hoopoe starling was in length. Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> was primarily white and grey, with its back, wings and tail a darker brown and grey. It had a light, mobile <a href="Crest%20%28feathers%29">crest</a>, which curled forwards. The bird is thought to have been <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with males larger and having more curved beaks. The juveniles were more brown than the adults. Little is known about hoopoe starling behaviour. Reportedly living in large flocks, it inhabited humid areas and marshes. The hoopoe starling was <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>, feeding on plant matter and insects. Its pelvis was robust, its feet and claws large, and its jaws strong, indicating that it foraged near the ground.

The birds were hunted by settlers on Réunion, who also kept them as <a href="cagebirds">cagebirds</a>. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling was reported to be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.

The first account thought to mention the hoopoe starling is a 1658 list of birds of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> written by French governor <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Flacourt">Étienne de Flacourt</a>. Although he mentioned a black-and-grey "tivouch" or <a href="hoopoe">hoopoe</a>, later authors have wondered whether this referred to the hoopoe starling or the Madagascan subspecies of hoopoe ("Upupa epops marginata"), though that bird resembles the Eurasian subspecies. The hoopoe starling was first noted on the <a href="Mascarene%20island">Mascarene island</a> of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> (then called "Bourbon") by Père Vachet in 1669, but was not described in detail until French traveller <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a>'s 1674 account:

Early settlers on Réunion referred to the bird as "huppe", due to the similarity of its crest and curved bill with that of the hoopoe. Little was recorded about the hoopoe starling during the next 100 years, but specimens began to be brought to Europe during the 18th century. Although the species was first scientifically described by French naturalist <a href="Philippe%20Gu%C3%A9neau%20de%20Montbeillard">Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard</a> in the 1779 edition of French naturalist <a href="Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a>'s "<a href="Histoire%20Naturelle">Histoire Naturelle</a>", it did not receive its <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> until its designation by Dutch naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> for the book's 1783 edition. Boddaert named the bird "Upupa varia"; its genus name is that of the hoopoe, and its specific name means "variegated", describing its black-and-white colour. 

Boddaert provided <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnean</a> <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> names for plates in Buffon's works, so the accompanying 1770s plate of the hoopoe starling by French engraver <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Nicolas%20Martinet">François-Nicolas Martinet</a> is considered the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> or type illustration. Though the plate may have been based on a specimen in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20in%20Paris">National Museum of Natural History in Paris</a>, this is impossible to determine today; the Paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins, some which only arrived during the 19th century. The possibly female specimen MNHN 2000-756, one of the most-illustrated skins, has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi-circular shape, unlike its appearance in life; the type illustration has a similarly shaped crest.

De Flacourt's "tivouch" led early writers to believe that variants of the bird were found on Madagascar and the <a href="Cape%20of%20Africa">Cape of Africa</a>; they were thought to be hoopoes of the genus "Upupa", which received names such as "Upupa capensis" and "Upupa madagascariensis". A number of authors also allied the bird with groups such as <a href="birds-of-paradise">birds-of-paradise</a>, <a href="bee-eater">bee-eater</a>s, <a href="cowbird">cowbird</a>s, <a href="Icteridae">Icteridae</a>, and <a href="chough">chough</a>s, resulting in its reassignment to other genera with new names, such as "Coracia cristata" and "Pastor upupa". In 1831, French naturalist <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">René-Primevère Lesson</a> placed the bird in its own <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus, "Fregilipus", a composite of "Upupa" and "Fregilus", the latter a defunct genus name of the chough. French naturalist <a href="Auguste%20Vinson">Auguste Vinson</a> established in 1868 that the bird was restricted to the island of Réunion and proposed a new binomial, "Fregilupus borbonicus", referring to the former name of the island.

German ornithologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> first proposed in 1857 that the species belonged to the <a href="starling">starling</a> family, (Sturnidae), reclassifying it as part of the genus "<a href="Sturnus">Sturnus</a>", "S. capensis". This reclassification was observed by other authors; Swedish zoologist <a href="Carl%20Jakob%20Sundevall">Carl Jakob Sundevall</a> proposed the new genus name "Lophopsarus" ("crested starling") in 1872, yet "Fregilupus varius"—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Museum%20of%20Zoology">Cambridge University Museum of Zoology</a>), British ornithologist James Murie agreed that it was a starling. English zoologist <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a> said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus "<a href="Basilornis">Basilornis</a>", but did not note any similarities other than their crests. 

In 1941, American ornithologist Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature similar to that of the <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a> ("Sturnus vulgaris") after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, American ornithologist <a href="Andrew%20John%20Berger">Andrew John Berger</a> cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. Some authors proposed a relationship with <a href="vanga">vanga</a>s (Vangidae), but Japanese ornithologist Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.

In 1875, British ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> attempted to identify a black-and-white bird mentioned in an 18th-century manuscript describing a marooned sailor's stay on the Mascarene island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> in 1726–27, hypothesising that it was related to the hoopoe starling. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> bones later found on Rodrigues were correlated with the bird in the manuscript; in 1879, these bones became the basis for a new species, "Necropsar rodericanus" (the <a href="Rodrigues%20starling">Rodrigues starling</a>), named by British ornithologists <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> and <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a>. Although they found the Rodrigues bird closely related to the hoopoe starling, Günther and Newton kept it in a separate genus due to "present ornithological practice". American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> suggested in 1967 that the Rodrigues starling belonged in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, due to their close similarity. Subfossils found in 1974 confirmed that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling; primarily, its stouter bill warrants <a href="generic%20separation">generic separation</a> from "Fregilupus". In 2014, British palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> described a new extinct species, the <a href="Mauritius%20starling">Mauritius starling</a> ("Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus"), based on subfossils from <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, which was closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling in its skull, <a href="sternal">sternal</a>, and <a href="humeral">humeral</a> features.

In 1943, American ornithologist <a href="Dean%20Amadon">Dean Amadon</a> suggested that "Sturnus"-like species could have arrived in Africa and given rise to the <a href="wattled%20starling">wattled starling</a> ("Creatophora cinerea") and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings—such as some "Sturnus" species—rather than to the <a href="glossy%20starlings">glossy starlings</a> ("Lamprotornis") of Africa and the <a href="Madagascan%20starling">Madagascan starling</a> ("Saroglossa aurata"), based on their colouration. A 2008 study by Italian zoologist Dario Zuccon and colleagues analysing the DNA of a variety of starlings confirmed that the hoopoe starling belonged in a <a href="clade">clade</a> of Southeast Asian starlings as an isolated lineage, with no close relatives. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows its position:
An earlier attempt by another team could not extract viable hoopoe starling DNA. Zuccon and colleagues suggested that ancestors of the hoopoe starling reached Réunion from Southeast Asia by using island chains as "stepping stones" across the Indian Ocean, a scenario also suggested for other Mascarene birds. Its lineage diverged from that of other starlings four million years ago (about two million years before Réunion emerged from the sea), so it may have first evolved on landmasses now partially submerged.

Extant relations, such as the <a href="Bali%20myna">Bali myna</a> ("Leucopsar rothschildi") and the <a href="white-headed%20starling">white-headed starling</a> ("Sturnia erythropygia"), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.

The hoopoe starling was in length. The bird's <a href="Beak%23Culmen">culmen</a> was long, its wing , its tail , and its <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> about long. It was the largest of the three Mascarene starlings. A presumed adult male (NHMUK 1889.5.30.15) in the Paris museum has a light ash-grey head and back of the neck (lighter on the hind-neck), with a long crest the same colour with white shafts. Its back and tail are ash-brown, its wings darker with a greyish wash, and its uppertail covert feathers and rump have a rufous wash. Its <a href="Flight%20feathers%23Primaries">primary</a> <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a> are white with brown tips, although the bases (instead of the tips) are brown in other specimens. The <a href="superciliary%20stripe">superciliary stripe</a>, <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lore</a>, and most of the specimen's underside is white, with a pale rufous wash on the flanks and undertail coverts. The extent of light rufous on the underside varies by specimen. The beak and legs are lemon-yellow, with yellow-brown claws. It has a bare, triangular area of skin around the eye, which may have been yellow in life. Though the species' <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> was described as bluish-brown, it has been depicted as brown, yellow or orange.

There has been confusion about which characteristics that were <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> in the species. Only three specimens were sexed (all males), with age and individual variation not considered. The male is thought to have been largest with a longer, curvier beak. In 1911, Réunion resident Eugène Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50 years before, suggesting that only males had a white crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller primary coverts. A juvenile specimen (MHNT O2650) has a smaller crest and primary coverts, with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest, lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back. The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults.

Vinson, who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on Réunion, described the crest as flexible, disunited and forward-curled barbs of various lengths, highest in the centre, and able to be erected at will. He compared the bird's crest to that of a <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a> and to the tail feathers of a <a href="bird-of-paradise">bird-of-paradise</a>. Most mounted specimens have an erect crest, indicating its natural position. The only illustration of the hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by French artist Paul Philippe Sauguin de Jossigny during the early 1770s. Jossigny instructed engravers under the drawing that for accuracy, they should depict the crest angled forward from the head (not straight up). Hume believes that Martinet did this when he made the type illustration, and it was derivative of Jossigny's image rather than a life drawing. Jossigny also made the only known life drawing of the now-extinct <a href="Newton%27s%20parakeet">Newton's parakeet</a> ("Psittacula exsul") after a specimen sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius, so this is perhaps also where he drew the hoopoe starling. Murie suggested that only the illustrations by Martinet and <a href="Jacques%20Barraband">Jacques Barraband</a> were "original", since he was unaware of Jossigny's drawing, but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike.

Little is known about the behaviour of the hoopoe starling. According to <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Levaillant">François Levaillant</a>'s 1807 account of the bird (which included observations from a Réunion resident) it was abundant, with large flocks inhabiting humid areas and marshes. In 1831, Lesson, without explanation, described its habits as similar to those of a <a href="crow">crow</a>. Its song was described as a "bright and cheerful whistle" and "clear notes", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings. Vinson's 1877 account relates his experiences with the bird more than 50 years earlier:
Like most other starlings, the hoopoe starling was <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue—long, slender, sharp, and frayed—may have been able to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. 

De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of ""Pseudobuxus"" (possibly "<a href="Eugenia%20buxifolia">Eugenia buxifolia</a>", a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed , and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities.

Many other endemic species on Réunion became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. The Hoopoe starling lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20ibis">Réunion ibis</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20parrot">Mascarene parrot</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">Réunion parakeet</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20swamphen">Réunion swamphen</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20owl">Réunion owl</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20night%20heron">Réunion night heron</a>, and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20pink%20pigeon">Réunion pink pigeon</a>. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20giant%20tortoise">Réunion giant tortoise</a> and an undescribed "<a href="Leiolopisma">Leiolopisma</a>" <a href="skink">skink</a>. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Réunion and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.

The hoopoe starling was described as tame and easily hunted. In 1704, French pilot engineer <a href="Jean%20Feuilley">Jean Feuilley</a> explained how the birds were caught by humans and cats:
The hoopoe starling was kept as a <a href="cagebird">cagebird</a> on Réunion and Mauritius, and although the bird was becoming scarcer, a number of specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food, such as bananas, potatoes, and <a href="chayote">chayote</a>, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.

There are nineteen surviving hoopoe starling specimens in museums around the world (including one skeleton and two specimens preserved in spirit), with two in the Paris museum and four in <a href="Troyes">Troyes</a>. Additional skins in Turin, Livorno, and Caen were destroyed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and four skins have disappeared from Réunion and Mauritius (which now have one each). Specimens were sent to Europe beginning in the second half of the 18th century, with most collected during the first half of the 19th century. It is unclear when each specimen was acquired, and specimens were frequently moved between collections. It is also unclear which specimens were the basis for which descriptions and illustrations. The only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur, discovered in 1993 in a Réunion <a href="grotto">grotto</a>.

Several causes for the decline and sudden disappearance of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that the introduction of the <a href="common%20myna">common myna</a> ("Acridotheres tristis") led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100 years and they may not have shared habitat. The <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus") arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a> ("Rattus norvegicus") in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20slit-eared%20skink">Réunion slit-eared skink</a> ("Gongylomorphus borbonicus") became extinct due to predation by the introduced <a href="wolf%20snake">wolf snake</a> ("Lycodon aulicum"), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.

Beginning in the 1830s, Réunion was deforested for plantations. Former slaves joined white peasants in cultivating pristine areas after slavery was abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was pushed to the edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made. 

The hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species, and was the last of the Mascarene starling species to become extinct. The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of "<a href="Aplonis">Aplonis</a>" starlings have disappeared from the <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific Islands</a>, with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to Réunion's rugged <a href="topography">topography</a> and highlands, where it spent much of the year.

Windsor Castle

Windsor Castle is a royal residence at <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a> in the English county of <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. It is notable for its long association with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> and later <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a> and for its architecture.

The original castle was built in the 11th century after the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20England">Norman invasion of England</a> by <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>. Since the time of <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian <a href="Hugh%20Roberts">Hugh Roberts</a> as "a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel</a>, considered by the historian <a href="John%20Martin%20Robinson">John Martin Robinson</a> to be "one of the supreme achievements of English <a href="Perpendicular%20Gothic">Perpendicular Gothic</a>" design.

Originally designed to protect <a href="Norman%20dynasty">Norman</a> dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, Windsor Castle was built as a <a href="motte-and-bailey">motte-and-bailey</a>, with three wards surrounding a central mound. Gradually replaced with stone fortifications, the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">First Barons' War</a> at the start of the 13th century. <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century, and <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a> went further, rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become "the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England". Edward's core design lasted through the Tudor period, during which <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment.

Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, when it was used as a military headquarters by <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentary</a> forces and a prison for <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. At the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a>, creating a set of extravagant <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during the 18th century, <a href="George%20III%20of%20England">George III</a> and <a href="George%20IV%20of%20England">George IV</a> renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design of the State Apartments, full of <a href="Rococo%20architecture">Rococo</a>, <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> and Baroque furnishings. <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> made a few minor changes to the castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a <a href="1992%20Windsor%20Castle%20fire">fire in 1992</a>. It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>.

Windsor Castle occupies , and combines the features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a <a href="1992%20Windsor%20Castle%20fire">fire in 1992</a>. It is in essence a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> and <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> design based on a medieval structure, with <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. As a result, architect Sir <a href="William%20Whitfield%20%28architect%29">William Whitfield</a> has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having "a certain fictive quality", the <a href="Picturesque">Picturesque</a> and Gothic design generating "a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a "place amongst the greatest European palaces".

At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward, a bailey formed around the <a href="motte-and-bailey">motte</a> or artificial hill in the centre of the ward. The motte is high and is made from <a href="chalk">chalk</a> originally excavated from the surrounding ditch. The <a href="keep">keep</a>, called the Round Tower, on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building, extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect <a href="Jeffry%20Wyatville">Jeffry Wyatville</a> by 30 ft (9 m) to produce a more imposing height and silhouette. The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned in 1991–3 to provide additional space for the <a href="Royal%20Archives">Royal Archives</a>, an additional room being built in the space left by Wyatville's originally hollow extension. The Round Tower is in reality <a href="epitrochoid">far from cylindrical</a>, due to the shape and structure of the motte beneath it. The current height of the tower has been criticised as being disproportionate to its width; archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, for example, has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure.

The western entrance to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse. This <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>, which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval <a href="lion%20mask">lion mask</a>s, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive entrance to the Upper Ward. Wyatville redesigned the exterior of the gatehouse, and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.

The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, with the Edward III Tower in the south-west corner. The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward. A bronze statue of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> on horseback sits beneath the Round Tower. Inspired by <a href="Hubert%20Le%20Sueur">Hubert Le Sueur</a>'s statue of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by <a href="Grinling%20Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a>. The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, which overlooks the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, and the East Terrace, which overlooks the gardens; both of the current terraces were constructed by <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a> in the 17th century.

Traditionally the Upper Ward was judged to be "to all intents and purposes a nineteenth-century creation ... the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be", as a result of the extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under <a href="George%20IV%20of%20England">George IV</a>. The walls of the Upper Ward are built of <a href="Swinley%20Forest">Bagshot Heath</a> stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow <a href="Bath%20stone">Bath stone</a>. The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for <a href="Gauged%20brickwork">galletting</a>, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a> movement of the late 18th century. Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling.

The State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle. The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace. On the first floor, the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a>, whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville's plans.

The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyatville in the early 19th century. Wyatville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period. With some alterations over the years, this concept continues to dominate the apartments. Different rooms follow the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Classical</a>, <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic</a> and <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> styles, together with an element of <a href="Jacobethan">Jacobethan</a> in places. Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire, using "equivalent restoration" methods – the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance, but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements. These rooms were also partially redesigned at the same time to more closely match modern tastes. Art historian <a href="Hugh%20Roberts">Hugh Roberts</a> has praised the State Apartments as "a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste." Others, such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic <a href="Hugh%20Pearman%20%28architecture%20critic%29">Hugh Pearman</a>, have described them as "bland" and "distinctly dull".
Wyatville's most famous work are those rooms designed in a Rococo style. These rooms take the fluid, playful aspects of this mid-18th-century artistic movement, including many original pieces of <a href="Louis%20XV%20style">Louis XV style</a>, but project them on a "vastly inflated" scale. Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle, originally thought to have been 18th-century fittings transferred from <a href="Carlton%20House%2C%20London">Carlton House</a> or France, are in fact 19th-century imitations in plasterwork and wood, designed to blend with original elements. The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs, 100 ft (30 m) long and 40 ft (12 m) tall and occupying the site of Edward III's great hall. This room, restored after the fire, includes a huge French Rococo ceiling, characterised by Ian Constantinides, the lead restorer, as possessing a "coarseness of form and crudeness of hand ... completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when you are at a distance". The room is set off by a set of restored <a href="Gobelins%20Manufactory">Gobelins French tapestries</a>. Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s, the result remains "one of the greatest set-pieces of Regency decoration". The White, Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of 62 <a href="Trophy%20%28architectural%29">trophies</a>: carved, gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war, many with <a href="Freemasonry">Masonic</a> meanings. Restored or replaced after the fire, these trophies are famous for their "vitality, precision and three-dimensional quality", and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826, some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt. The soft furnishings of these rooms, although luxurious, are more modest than the 1820s originals, both on the grounds of modern taste and cost.

Wyatville's design retains three rooms originally built by May in the 17th century in partnership with the painter <a href="Antonio%20Verrio">Antonio Verrio</a> and carver <a href="Grinling%20Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a>. The Queen's Presence Chamber, the Queen's Audience Chamber and the King's Dining Room are designed in a Baroque, Franco-Italian style, characterised by "gilded interiors enriched with florid murals", first introduced to England between 1648 and 1650 at <a href="Wilton%20House">Wilton House</a>. Verrio's paintings are "drenched in medievalist allusion" and classical images. These rooms were intended to show an innovative English "baroque fusion" of the hitherto separate arts of architecture, painting and carving.
A handful of rooms in the modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design originates from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal of some of the gilded features on the pilasters. <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a>'s Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic <a href="vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted</a> lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a> and executed by <a href="Francis%20Bernasconi">Francis Bernasconi</a>. The staircase has been criticised by historian <a href="John%20Martin%20Robinson">John Robinson</a> as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.

Some parts of the State Apartments were completely destroyed in the 1992 fire and this area was rebuilt in a style called "Downesian Gothic", named after the architect, <a href="Giles%20Downes">Giles Downes</a>. The style comprises "the rather stripped, cool and systematic coherence of modernism sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic tradition". Downes argues that the style avoids "florid decoration", emphasising an organic, flowing Gothic structure. Three new rooms were built or remodelled by Downes at Windsor. Downes' new <a href="hammer-beam%20roof">hammer-beam roof</a> of St George's Hall is the largest green-oak structure built since the Middle Ages, and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the gothic woodwork along the ceiling. The Lantern Lobby features flowing oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling, imitating an <a href="arum%20lily">arum lily</a>. The new Private Chapel is relatively small, only able to fit thirty worshippers, but combines architectural elements of the St George's Hall roof with the Lantern Lobby and the stepped arch structure of the Henry VIII chapel vaulting at <a href="Hampton%20Court">Hampton Court</a>. The result is an "extraordinary, continuous and closely moulded net of tracery", complementing the new stained glass windows commemorating the fire, designed by Joseph Nuttgen. The Great Kitchen, with its newly exposed 14th-century roof lantern sitting alongside Wyatville's fireplaces, chimneys and Gothic tables, is also a product of the reconstruction after the fire.

The ground floor of the State Apartments retains various famous medieval features. The 14th-century Great Undercroft still survives, some long by wide, divided into 13 bays. At the time of the 1992 fire, the Undercroft had been divided into smaller rooms; the area is now opened up to form a single space in an effort to echo the undercrofts at <a href="Fountains%20Abbey">Fountains</a> and <a href="Rievaulx%20Abbey">Rievaulx Abbey</a>s, although the floor remains artificially raised for convenience of use. The "beautifully vaulted" 14th-century Larderie passage runs alongside the Kitchen Courtyard and is decorated with carved royal roses, marking its construction by Edward III.

The Lower Ward lies below and to the west of the Round Tower, reached through the Norman Gate. Originally largely of medieval design, most of the Lower Ward was renovated or reconstructed during the mid-Victorian period by <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> and <a href="Edward%20Blore">Edward Blore</a>, to form a "consistently Gothic composition". The Lower Ward holds <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel</a> and most of the buildings associated with the Order of the Garter.

On the north side of the Lower Ward is St George's Chapel. This huge building is the spiritual home of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Knights of the Garter</a> and dates from the late 15th and early 16th century, designed in the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Perpendicular Gothic</a> style. The ornate wooden <a href="Choir%20of%20St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">choir stalls</a> are of 15th-century design, having been restored and extended by <a href="Henry%20Emlyn">Henry Emlyn</a> at the end of the 18th century, and are decorated with a unique set of brass plates showing the arms of the Knights of the Garter over the last six centuries. On the west side, the chapel has a grand Victorian door and staircase, used on ceremonial occasions. The east stained glass window is Victorian, and the <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a> to the north side of it was built by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> for <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>. The vault in front of the altar houses the remains of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>, <a href="Jane%20Seymour">Jane Seymour</a> and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, with <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a> buried nearby. The chapel is considered by historian John Robinson to be "one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic" design.
At the east end of St George's Chapel is the Lady Chapel, originally built by <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> in the 13th century and converted into the Albert Memorial Chapel between 1863 and 1873 by <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a>. Built to commemorate the life of <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, the ornate chapel features lavish decoration and works in marble, glass mosaic and bronze by Henri de Triqueti, Susan Durant, <a href="Alfred%20Gilbert">Alfred Gilbert</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Salviati">Antonio Salviati</a>. The east door of the chapel, covered in ornamental ironwork, is the original door from 1246.

At the west end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, originally built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or <a href="lay%20clerk">lay clerk</a>s of the chapel. This curved brick and timber building is said to have been designed to resemble the shape of a <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a>, one of the <a href="livery%20badge">badges</a> used by Edward IV. <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a> heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular <a href="tracery">tracery</a>. As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">Canons</a>.

Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of the oldest surviving parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a <a href="sally%20port">sally port</a>, a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege. The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style <a href="cone%20%28geometry%29">conical</a> roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion of <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Viollet-le-Duc">Eugène Viollet-le-Duc</a>'s recreation of <a href="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>.

On the opposite side of the chapel is a range of buildings including the lodgings of the <a href="Military%20Knights%20of%20Windsor">Military Knights</a>, and the residence of the <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20Military%20Knights%20of%20Windsor">Governor of the Military Knights</a>. These buildings originate from the 16th century and are still used by the Knights, who represent the Order of the Garter each Sunday. On the south side of the Ward is King Henry VIII's gateway, which bears the coat of arms of <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and forms the secondary entrance to the castle.

Windsor Castle's position on top of steep ground has meant that the castle's gardens are limited in scale. The castle gardens stretch east from the Upper Ward across a 19th-century terrace. Windsor Castle is surrounded by extensive parkland. The immediate area stretching to the east of the castle is a 19th-century creation known as the <a href="Home%20Park%2C%20Windsor">Home Park</a>. The Home Park includes parkland and two working farms, along with many estate cottages mainly occupied by employees and the <a href="Frogmore">Frogmore</a> estate. The Long Walk, a double lined avenue of trees, runs for south of the castle, and is 240 ft (75 m) wide. The original 17th-century elms were replaced with alternating <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a> and <a href="Platanus">plane</a> trees. The impact of <a href="Dutch%20elm%20disease">Dutch elm disease</a> led to large-scale replanting after 1945.

The Home Park adjoins the northern edge of the more extensive <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a>, occupying some and including some of the oldest <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">broadleaved woodlands</a> in Europe. In the Home Park, to the north of the castle, stands a private school, <a href="St%20George%27s%20School%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's</a>, which provides <a href="choir">choristers</a> to the chapel. <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> is located about half a mile from the castle, across the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, reflecting the fact that it was a royal foundation of <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>.

Windsor Castle was originally built by <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a> in the decade after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a> of 1066. William established a defensive ring of <a href="motte%20and%20bailey">motte and bailey</a> castles around London; each was a day's march – about  – from the city and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, a key medieval route into London, and <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Forest</a>, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or <a href="Clewer">Clewer</a>, was an old <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Saxon</a> residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a <a href="keep">keep</a> on the top of a man-made <a href="motte%20and%20bailey%20castle">motte</a>, or mound, protected by a small <a href="Ward%20%28fortification%29">bailey</a> wall, occupying a chalk <a href="Inliers%20and%20outliers%20%28geology%29">inlier</a>, or bluff, rising 100 ft (30 m) above the river. A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. In design, Windsor most closely resembled <a href="Arundel%20Castle">Arundel Castle</a>, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at <a href="Rockingham%20Castle">Rockingham</a> and <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>.

Windsor was not initially used as a royal residence; the early Norman kings preferred to use the former palace of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> in the village of <a href="Old%20Windsor">Old Windsor</a>. The first king to use Windsor Castle as a residence was <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, who celebrated <a href="Pentecost">Whitsuntide</a> at the castle in 1110 during a period of heightened insecurity. Henry's marriage to <a href="Adeliza%20of%20Louvain">Adela</a>, the daughter of <a href="Godfrey%20I%20of%20Leuven%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lower%20Lotharingia">Godfrey of Louvain</a>, took place in the castle in 1121. During this period the keep suffered a substantial collapse – archaeological evidence shows that the southern side of the motte <a href="Subsidence">subsided</a> by over 6 ft (2 m). Timber piles were driven in to support the motte and the old wooden keep was replaced with a new stone <a href="shell%20keep">shell keep</a>, with a probable gateway to the north-east and a new stone well. A <a href="Chemise%20%28wall%29">chemise</a>, or low protective wall, was subsequently added to the keep.

<a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> came to the throne in 1154 and built extensively at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning to appear in the stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in from the edge of the motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. <a href="Bagshot%20Heath">Bagshot Heath</a> stone was used for most of the work, and stone from <a href="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a> for the internal buildings.

<a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a> undertook some building works at Windsor, but primarily to the accommodation rather than the defences. The castle played a role during the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">revolt of the English barons</a>: the castle was besieged in 1214, and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before the signing of the <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a> at nearby <a href="Runnymede">Runnymede</a> in 1215. In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the <a href="Herv%C3%A9%20IV%20of%20Donzy">Count of Nevers</a>, but John's <a href="Constable%23United%20Kingdom">constable</a>, <a href="Engelard%20de%20Cigogn%C3%A9">Engelard de Cigogné</a>, successfully defended it.

The damage done to the castle during the second siege was immediately repaired in 1216 and 1221 by Cigogne on behalf of John's successor <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, who further strengthened the defences. The walls of the Lower Ward were rebuilt in stone, complete with a gatehouse in the location of the future Henry VIII Gate, between 1224 and 1230. Three new towers, the Curfew, Garter and the Salisbury towers, were constructed. The Middle Ward was heavily reinforced with a southern stone wall, protected by the new Edward III and Henry III towers at each end.

Windsor Castle was one of Henry's three favourite residences and he invested heavily in the royal accommodation, spending more money at Windsor than in any other of his properties. Following his marriage to <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Provence">Eleanor of Provence</a>, Henry built a luxurious palace in 1240–63, based around a court along the north side of the Upper Ward. This was intended primarily for the queen and Henry's children. In the Lower Ward, the king ordered the construction of a range of buildings for his own use along the south wall, including a 70 ft (21 m) long chapel, later called the <a href="Lady%20Chapel">Lady Chapel</a>. This was the grandest of the numerous chapels built for his own use, and comparable to the <a href="Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a> in Paris in size and quality. Henry repaired the Great Hall that lay along the north side of the Lower Ward, and enlarged it with a new kitchen and built a covered walkway between the Hall and the kitchen. Henry's work was characterised by the religious overtones of the rich decorations, which formed "one of the high-water marks of English medieval art". The conversion cost more than £10,000. The result was to create a division in the castle between a more private Upper Ward and a Lower Ward devoted to the public face of the monarchy. Little further building was carried out at the castle during the 13th century; the Great Hall in the Lower Ward was destroyed by fire in 1296, but it was not rebuilt.

<a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a> was born at Windsor Castle and used it extensively throughout his reign. In 1344 the king announced the foundation of the new Order of the Round Table at the castle. Edward began to construct a new building in the castle to host this order, but it was never finished. Chroniclers described it as a round building, 200 ft (61 m) across, and it was probably in the centre of the Upper Ward. Shortly afterwards, Edward abandoned the new order for reasons that remain unclear, and instead established the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, again with Windsor Castle as its headquarters, complete with the attendant <a href="Military%20Knights%20of%20Windsor">Poor Knights of Windsor</a>. As part of this process Edward decided to rebuild Windsor Castle, in particular Henry III's palace, in an attempt to construct a castle that would be symbolic of royal power and chivalry. Edward was influenced both by the military successes of his grandfather, Edward I, and by the decline of royal authority under his father, Edward II, and aimed to produce an innovative, "self-consciously aesthetic, muscled, martial architecture".

Edward placed <a href="William%20of%20Wykeham">William of Wykeham</a> in overall charge of the rebuilding and design of the new castle and whilst work was ongoing Edward stayed in temporary accommodation in the Round Tower. Between 1350 and 1377 Edward spent £51,000 on renovating Windsor Castle; this was the largest amount spent by any English medieval monarch on a single building operation, and over one and a half times Edward's typical annual income of £30,000. Some of the costs of the castle were paid from the results of ransoms following Edward's victories at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%29">Calais</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers%20%281356%29">Poitiers</a>. Windsor Castle was already a substantial building before Edward began expanding it, making the investment all the more impressive, and much of the expenditure was lavished on rich furnishings. The castle was "the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England".

Edward's new palace consisted of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward, called Little Cloister, King's Cloister and the Kitchen Court. At the front of the palace lay the St George's Hall range, which combined a new hall and a new chapel. This range had two symmetrical gatehouses, the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse. The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace, whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard. The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward. The range had an unusual, unified roof-line and, with a taller roof than the rest of the palace, would have been highly distinctive. The Rose Tower, designed for the king's private use, set off the west corner of the range. The result was a "great and apparently architecturally unified palace ... uniform in all sorts of ways, as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights". With the exception of the Hall, Chapel and the Great Chamber, the new interiors all shared a similar height and width. The defensive features, however, were primarily for show, possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two-halves of the Order of the Garter.
Edward built further luxurious, self-contained lodgings for his court around the east and south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical <a href="Clock%23A%20new%20mechanism">clock</a> in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a> and <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a>, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.

The new castle was used to hold French prisoners taken at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 1357, including <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">King John II</a>, who was held for a <a href="Ransom%20of%20King%20John%20II%20of%20France">considerable ransom</a>. Later in the century, the castle also found favour with <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a>. Richard conducted restoration work on St George's Chapel, the work being carried out by <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, who served as a diplomat and Clerk of The King's Works.

Windsor Castle continued to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a> seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a>, who had escaped to London. Under <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a>, the castle hosted a visit from the <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits.

By the middle of the 15th century England was increasingly divided between the rival royal factions of the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrians</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20York">Yorkists</a>. Castles such as Windsor did not play a decisive role during the resulting <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> (1455–85), which were fought primarily in the form of pitched battles between the rival factions. <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>, born at Windsor Castle and known as Henry of Windsor, became king at the young age of nine months. His long period of minority, coupled with the increasing tensions between Henry's Lancastrian supporters and the Yorkists, distracted attention from Windsor. The Garter Feasts and other ceremonial activities at the castle became more infrequent and less well attended.

<a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a> seized power in 1461. When Edward captured Henry's wife, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a>, she was brought back to be detained at the castle. Edward began to revive the Order of the Garter, and held a particularly lavish feast in 1472. Edward began the construction of the present <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor">St. George's Chapel</a> in 1475, resulting in the dismantling of several of the older buildings in the Lower Ward. By building the grand chapel Edward was seeking to show that his new dynasty were the permanent rulers of England, and may also have been attempting to deliberately rival the similar chapel that Henry VI had ordered to be constructed at nearby <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>. <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a> made only a brief use of Windsor Castle before his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a> in 1485, but had the body of Henry VI moved from <a href="Chertsey%20Abbey">Chertsey Abbey</a> in Surrey to the castle to allow it to be visited by pilgrims more easily.

Henry VII made more use of Windsor. In 1488, shortly after succeeding to the throne, he held a massive feast for the Order of the Garter at the castle. He completed the roof of St George's Chapel, and set about converting the older eastern <a href="Lady%20Chapel">Lady Chapel</a> into a proposed shrine to Henry VI, whose canonisation was then considered imminent. In the event, Henry VI was not canonised and the project was abandoned, although the shrine continued to attract a flood of pilgrims. Henry VII appears to have remodelled the King's Chamber in the palace, and had the roof of the Great Kitchen rebuilt in 1489. He also built a three-storied tower on the west end of the palace, which he used for his personal apartments. Windsor began to be used for international diplomatic events, including the grand visit of <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20Castile">Philip I of Castile</a> in 1506. <a href="Edmund%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">William de la Pole</a>, one of the surviving Yorkist claimants to the throne, was imprisoned at Windsor Castle during Henry's reign, before his execution in 1513.

<a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> enjoyed Windsor Castle, as a young man "exercising himself daily in shooting, singing, dancing, wrestling, casting of the bar, playing at the recorders, flute, virginals, in setting of songs and making of ballads". The tradition of the Garter Feasts was maintained and became more extravagant; the size of the royal retinue visiting Windsor had to be restricted because of the growing numbers. During the <a href="Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a>, a huge uprising in the north of England against Henry's rule in 1536, the king used Windsor as a secure base in the south from which to manage his military response. Throughout the Tudor period, Windsor was also used as a safe retreat in the event of plagues occurring in London.

Henry rebuilt the principal castle gateway in about 1510 and constructed a tennis court at the base of the motte in the Upper Ward. He also built a long terrace, called the North Wharf, along the outside wall of the Upper Ward; constructed of wood, it was designed to provide a commanding view of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> below. The design included an outside staircase into the king's apartments, which made the monarch's life more comfortable at the expense of considerably weakening the castle's defences. Early in his reign, Henry had given the eastern <a href="Lady%20Chapel">Lady Chapel</a> to <a href="Thomas%20Wolsey">Cardinal Wolsey</a> for Wolsey's future mausoleum. <a href="Benedetto%20Grazzini">Benedetto Grazzini</a> converted much of this into an Italian Renaissance design, before Wolsey's fall from power brought an end to the project, with contemporaries estimating that around £60,000 (£295 million in 2008 terms) had been spent on the work. Henry continued the project, but it remained unfinished when he himself was buried in the chapel, in an elaborate funeral in 1547.
By contrast, the young <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> disliked Windsor Castle. Edward's Protestant beliefs led him to simplify the Garter ceremonies, to discontinue the annual Feast of the Garter at Windsor and to remove any signs of Catholic practices with the Order. During the rebellions and political strife of 1549, Windsor was again used as a safe-haven for the king and the <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>. Edward famously commented whilst staying at Windsor Castle during this period that "Methink I am in a prison, here are no galleries, nor no gardens to walk in". Under both Edward and his sister, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a>, some limited building work continued at the castle, in many cases using resources recovered from the English abbeys. Water was piped into the Upper Ward to create a fountain. Mary also expanded the buildings used by the Knights of Windsor in the Lower Ward, using stone from <a href="Reading%20Abbey">Reading Abbey</a>.

<a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> spent much of her time at Windsor Castle and used it a safe haven in crises, "knowing it could stand a siege if need be". Ten new <a href="brass">brass</a> cannons were purchased for the castle's defence. It became one of her favourite locations and she spent more money on the property than on any of her other palaces. She conducted some modest building works at Windsor, including a wide range of repairs to the existing structures. She converted the North Wharf into a permanent, huge stone terrace, complete with statues, carvings and an octagonal, outdoor banqueting house, raising the western end of the terrace to provide more privacy. The chapel was refitted with stalls, a gallery and a new ceiling. A bridge was built over the ditch to the south of the castle to enable easier access to the park. Elizabeth built a gallery range of buildings on the west end of the Upper Ward, alongside Henry VII's tower. Elizabeth increasingly used the castle for diplomatic engagements, but space continued to prove a challenge as the property was simply not as large as the more modern royal palaces. This flow of foreign visitors was captured for the queen's entertainment in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play, "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>".

<a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a> used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for socialising with his friends. Many of these occasions involved extensive <a href="Drinking%23Alcoholic%20beverages">drinking</a> sessions, including one with <a href="Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Christian IV of Denmark</a> in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings. The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms.

<a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> was a connoisseur of art, and paid greater attention to the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed <a href="Nicholas%20Stone">Nicholas Stone</a> to improve the chapel gallery in the <a href="Northern%20Mannerism">Mannerist</a> style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a <a href="baroque">baroque</a> gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In the final years of peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.

In 1642 the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> broke out, dividing the country into the <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> supporters of Charles, and the <a href="Roundheads">Parliamentarians</a>. In the aftermath of the <a href="battle%20of%20Edgehill">battle of Edgehill</a> in October, Parliament became concerned that Charles might advance on London. <a href="John%20Venn%20%28regicide%29">John Venn</a> took control of Windsor Castle with twelve companies of foot soldiers to protect the route along the Thames river, becoming the governor of the castle for the duration of the war. The contents of St George's Chapel were both valuable and, to many Parliamentary forces, inappropriately <a href="high%20church">high church</a> in style. Looting began immediately: Edward IV's bejewelled coat of mail was stolen; the chapel's organs, windows and books destroyed; the Lady Chapel was emptied of valuables, including the component parts of Henry VIII's unfinished tomb. By the end of the war, some 3580 oz (101 kg) of gold and silver <a href="Silver%20%28household%29">plate</a> had been looted.

<a href="Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine">Prince Rupert of the Rhine</a>, a prominent Royalist general, attempted to relieve Windsor Castle that November. Rupert's small force of cavalry was able to take the town of Windsor, but was unable to overcome the walls at Windsor Castle – in due course, Rupert was forced to retreat. Over the winter of 1642–3, Windsor Castle was converted into the headquarters for the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>, a senior Parliamentary general. The Horseshoe Cloister was taken over as a prison for captured Royalists, and the resident <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> were expelled from the castle. The Lady Chapel was turned into a <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>. Looting by the underpaid garrison continued to be a problem; 500 royal deer were killed across the Windsor Great Park during the winter, and fences were burned as firewood.

In 1647 Charles, then a prisoner of Parliament, was brought to the castle for a period under arrest, before being moved to <a href="Hampton%20Court">Hampton Court</a>. In 1648 there was a Royalist plan, never enacted, to seize Windsor Castle. The Parliamentary <a href="Army%20Council%20%281647%29">Army Council</a> moved into Windsor in November and decided to try Charles for treason. Charles was held at Windsor again for the last three weeks of his reign; after his execution in January 1649, his body was taken back to Windsor that night through a snowstorm, to be interred without ceremony in the <a href="tomb">vault</a> beneath <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel</a>.
<a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">The Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660 saw the first period of significant change to Windsor Castle for many years. The civil war and the years of the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">Interregnum</a> had caused extensive damage to the royal palaces in England. At the same time the shifting "functional requirements, patterns of movement, modes of transport, aesthetic taste and standards of comfort" amongst royal circles was changing the qualities being sought in a successful palace. Windsor was the only royal palace to be successfully fully modernised by Charles II in the Restoration years.

During the Interregnum, however, squatters had occupied Windsor Castle. As a result, the "King's house was a wreck; the fanatic, the pilferer, and the squatter, having been at work ... Paupers had squatted in many of the towers and cabinets". Shortly after returning to England, Charles appointed <a href="Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine">Prince Rupert</a>, one of his few surviving close relatives, to be the <a href="Constable%20of%20Windsor%20Castle">Constable of Windsor Castle</a> in 1668. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the <a href="real%20tennis">real tennis</a> court. Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany, but the herds never recovered their pre-war size. Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower, decorated with an "extraordinary" number of weapons and armour, with his inner chambers "hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures".
Charles was heavily influenced by <a href="Louis%20XIV%20Style">Louis XIV style</a> and imitated French design at his <a href="King%27s%20House%2C%20Winchester">palace at Winchester</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20Chelsea">Royal Hospital</a> at <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>. At Windsor, Charles created "the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England". Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s. French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of <a href="Enfilade%20%28architecture%29">enfiladed</a> rooms to satisfy court protocol; the demand for space forced architect <a href="Hugh%20May">Hugh May</a> to expand out into the North Terrace, rebuilding and widening it in the process. This new building was called the Star Building, because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it. May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III's hall and chapel, incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building. Although Windsor Castle was now big enough to hold the entire court, it was not built with chambers for the King's Council, as would be found in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>. Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court</a> when he was staying at the castle. The result became an "exemplar" for royal buildings for the next twenty-five years. The result of May's work showed a medievalist leaning; although sometimes criticised for its "dullness", May's reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th-century version of a "neo-Norman" castle.

<a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> commissioned <a href="Nicholas%20Hawksmoor">Nicholas Hawksmoor</a> and Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> to conduct a large, final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward, but the king's early death caused the plan to be cancelled. <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> was fond of the castle, and attempted to address the lack of a formal garden by instructing <a href="Henry%20Wise%20%28gardener%29">Henry Wise</a> to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace, which was never completed. Anne also created the racecourse at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot</a> and began the tradition of the annual <a href="Royal%20Ascot">Royal Ascot procession</a> from the castle.

<a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> took little interest in Windsor Castle, preferring his other palaces at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's</a>, <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court</a> and <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington</a>. <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a> rarely used Windsor either, preferring Hampton Court. Many of the apartments in the Upper Ward were given out as "<a href="grace%20and%20favour">grace and favour</a>" privileges for the use of prominent widows or other friends of the Crown. The <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cumberland">Duke of Cumberland</a> made the most use of the property in his role as the <a href="Ranger%20of%20Windsor%20Great%20Park">Ranger of Windsor Great Park</a>. By the 1740s, Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's <a href="narwhal">narwhal</a> horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks to Windsor, produced by <a href="George%20Bickham%20the%20Younger">George Bickham</a> in 1753 and Joseph Pote in 1755. As the condition of the State Apartments continued to deteriorate, even the general public were able to regularly visit the property.

<a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> reversed this trend when he came to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cumberland%20and%20Strathearn">Henry</a> was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.

George's architectural taste shifted over the years. As a young man, he favoured Classical, in particular <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> styles, but the king came to favour a more Gothic style, both as a consequence of the Palladian style becoming overused and poorly implemented, and because the Gothic form had come to be seen as a more honest, national style of English design in the light of the <a href="French%20revolution">French revolution</a>. Working with the architect <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a>, George attempted to "transform the exterior of the buildings in the Upper Ward into a Gothic palace, while retaining the character of the Hugh May state rooms". The outside of the building was restyled with Gothic features, including new battlements and turrets. Inside, conservation work was undertaken, and several new rooms constructed, including a new Gothic staircase to replace May's 17th-century version, complete with the Grand Vestibule ceiling above it. New paintings were purchased for the castle, and collections from other royal palaces moved there by the king. The cost of the work came to over £150,000 (£100 million in 2008 terms). The king undertook extensive work in the castle's Great Park as well, laying out the new Norfolk and Flemish farms, creating two dairies and restoring <a href="Virginia%20Water%20Lake">Virginia Water Lake</a>, and its <a href="grotto">grotto</a> and <a href="folly">follies</a>.

At the end of this period Windsor Castle became a place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; diagnosed as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the <a href="Kew%20Palace%23Augusta%20and%20George">White House</a> at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year.

<a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> came to the throne in 1820 intending to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, <a href="Carlton%20House%2C%20London">Carlton House</a> and the <a href="Brighton%20Pavilion">Brighton Pavilion</a> were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the <a href="Royal%20Lodge">Royal Lodge</a> in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king.

George persuaded <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> to vote him £300,000 for restoration (£245 million in 2008 terms). Under the guidance of George's advisor, <a href="Charles%20Long%2C%201st%20Baron%20Farnborough">Charles Long</a>, the architect <a href="Jeffry%20Wyatville">Jeffry Wyatville</a> was selected, and work commenced in 1824.
Wyatville's own preference ran to Gothic architecture, but George, who had led the reintroduction of the French <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> style to England at Carlton House, preferred a blend of periods and styles, and applied this taste to Windsor. The terraces were closed off to visitors for greater privacy and the exterior of the Upper Ward was completely remodelled into its current appearance. The Round Tower was raised in height to create a more dramatic appearance; many of the rooms in the State Apartments were rebuilt or remodelled; numerous new towers were created, much higher than the older versions. The south range of the ward was rebuilt to provide private accommodation for the king, away from the state rooms. The statue of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> was moved from the centre of the Upper Ward to the base of the motte. Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> captured contemporary views when he noted that the work showed "a great deal of taste and feeling for the Gothic architecture"; many modern commentators, including <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, have criticised Wyatville's work as representing an act of vandalism of May's earlier designs. The work was unfinished at the time of George IV's death in 1830, but was broadly completed by Wyatville's death in 1840. The total expenditure on the castle had soared to the colossal sum of over one million pounds (£817 million in 2008 terms) by the end of the project.
<a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> made Windsor Castle their principal royal residence, despite Victoria complaining early in her reign that the castle was "dull and tiresome" and "prison-like", and preferring <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne</a> and <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral</a> as holiday residences. The growth of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and Victoria's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits, assisted by the new railways and <a href="steamboat">steamships</a> of the period. Indeed, it has been argued that Windsor reached its social peak during the Victorian era, seeing the introduction of invitations to numerous prominent figures to "dine and sleep" at the castle. Victoria took a close interest in the details of how Windsor Castle was run, including the minutiae of the social events. Few visitors found these occasions comfortable, both due to the design of the castle and the excessive royal formality. Prince Albert died in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle in 1861 and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum built at nearby <a href="Frogmore">Frogmore</a>, within the <a href="Home%20Park%2C%20Windsor">Home Park</a>. The prince's rooms were maintained exactly as they had been at the moment of his death and Victoria kept the castle in a state of mourning for many years, becoming known as the "<a href="The%20Widow%20at%20Windsor">Widow of Windsor</a>", a phrase popularised in the famous poem by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. The Queen shunned the use of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> after Albert's death and instead used Windsor Castle as her residence when conducting official business near London. Towards the end of her reign, plays, operas, and other entertainments slowly began to be held at the castle again, accommodating both the Queen's desire for entertainment and her reluctance to be seen in public.

Several minor alterations were made to the Upper Ward under Victoria. <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> rebuilt Wyatville's grand staircase, with <a href="Edward%20Blore">Edward Blore</a> constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments. Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853. Ludwig Gruner assisted in the design of the Queen's Private Audience Chamber in the south range. Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward, under the direction of Prince Albert, including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town, rebuilding the Garter, Curfew and Salisbury towers, the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse. <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a> rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s. The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir <a href="Henry%20Ponsonby">Henry Ponsonby</a>. Windsor Castle did not benefit from many of the minor improvements of the era, however, as Victoria disliked <a href="Gas%20lighting">gaslight</a>, preferring candles; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign. Indeed, the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria's reign, but it was connected to a nearby reservoir, with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time.

Many of the changes under Victoria were to the surrounding parklands and buildings. The Royal Dairy at Frogmore was rebuilt in a <a href="Jacobethan">Tudorbethan</a> style in 1853; George III's Dairy rebuilt in a <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> style in 1859; the Georgian Flemish Farm rebuilt, and the Norfolk Farm renovated. The Long Walk was planted with fresh trees to replace the diseased stock. The <a href="Windsor%20Castle%20Act%201848">Windsor Castle and Town Approaches Act</a>, passed by Parliament in 1848, permitted the closing and re-routing of the old roads which previously ran through the park from Windsor to <a href="Datchet">Datchet</a> and <a href="Old%20Windsor">Old Windsor</a>. These changes allowed the Royal Family to undertake the enclosure of a large area of parkland to form the private "Home Park" with no public roads passing through it. The Queen granted additional rights for public access to the remainder of the park as part of this arrangement.

<a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> came to the throne in 1901 and immediately set about modernising Windsor Castle with "enthusiasm and zest". Many of the rooms in the Upper Ward were de-cluttered and redecorated for the first time in many years, with Edward "peering into cabinets; ransacking drawers; clearing rooms formerly used by the Prince Consort and not touched since his death; dispatching case-loads of relics and ornaments to a special room in the Round Tower ... destroying statues and busts of <a href="John%20Brown%20%28servant%29">John Brown</a> ... throwing out hundreds of 'rubbishy old coloured photographs' ... [and] rearranging pictures". Electric lighting was added to more rooms, along with <a href="central%20heating">central heating</a>; telephone lines were installed, along with garages for the newly invented automobiles. The <a href="marathon">marathon</a> was run from Windsor Castle at the <a href="1908%20Summer%20Olympics">1908 Olympics</a>, and in 1911 the pioneering aviator <a href="Thomas%20Sopwith">Thomas Sopwith</a> landed an aircraft at the castle for the first time.

<a href="George%20V">George V</a> continued a process of more gradual modernisation, assisted by his wife, <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary of Teck</a>, who had a strong interest in furniture and decoration. Mary sought out and re-acquired items of furniture that had been lost or sold from the castle, including many dispersed by Edward VII, and also acquired many new works of art to furnish the state rooms. Queen Mary was also a lover of all things miniature, and a famous <a href="Queen%20Mary%27s%20Dolls%27%20House">dolls' house</a> was created for her at Windsor Castle, designed by the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a> and furnished by leading craftsmen and designers of the 1930s. George V was committed to maintaining a high standard of court life at Windsor Castle, adopting the motto that everything was to be "of the best". A large staff was still kept at the castle, with around 660 servants working in the property during the period. Meanwhile, during the First World War, anti-German feeling led the members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">Royal Family</a> to change their dynastic name from the German <a href="House%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>; George decided to take the new name from the castle, and the Royal Family became the <a href="House%20of%20Windsor">House of Windsor</a> in 1917.

<a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> did not spend much of his reign at Windsor Castle. He continued to spend most of his time at <a href="Fort%20Belvedere%2C%20Berkshire">Fort Belvedere</a> in the <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Great Park</a>, where he had lived whilst Prince of Wales. Edward created a small <a href="aerodrome">aerodrome</a> at the castle on Smith's Lawn, now used as a golf-course. Edward's reign was short-lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> from the castle in December 1936, adopting the title of <a href="Duke%20of%20Windsor">Duke of Windsor</a>. His successor, <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> also preferred his own original home, the <a href="Royal%20Lodge">Royal Lodge</a> in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Elizabeth</a>. As king, George revived the annual <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter%23Garter%20service%20at%20St%20George%27s%20Chapel">Garter Service</a> at Windsor, drawing on the accounts of the 17th-century ceremonies recorded by <a href="Elias%20Ashmole">Elias Ashmole</a>, but moving the event to <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot Week</a> in June.

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the castle was readied for war-time conditions. Many of the staff from Buckingham Palace were moved to Windsor for safety, security was tightened and windows were blacked-out. There was significant concern that the castle might be damaged or destroyed during the war; the more important art works were removed from the castle for safe-keeping, the valuable chandeliers were lowered to the floor in case of bomb damage and a sequence of paintings by <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a> were commissioned from 1942–4 to record the castle's appearance. The king and queen and their children Princesses <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="Princess%20Margaret%2C%20Countess%20of%20Snowdon">Margaret</a> lived for safety in the castle, with the roof above their rooms specially strengthened in case of attack. The king and queen drove daily to London, returning to Windsor to sleep, although at the time this was a well-kept secret, as for propaganda and morale purposes it was reported that the king was still residing full-time at Buckingham Palace. The castle was also used as a storage facility; for example, the only purified <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> at the time was rescued from <a href="France">France</a> in the face of the imminent <a href="Battle%20of%20France">French defeat</a> in 1940, and most of it was sent to the castle to be stored in the basement alongside the <a href="Crown%20Jewels%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Crown Jewels</a>. After the war the king revived the "dine and sleep" events at Windsor, following comments that the castle had become "almost like a vast, empty museum"; nonetheless, it took many years to restore Windsor Castle to its pre-war condition.

In February 1952, Elizabeth II came to the throne and decided to make Windsor her principal weekend retreat. The private apartments which had not been properly occupied since the era of <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> were renovated and further modernised, and the Queen, <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> and their two children took up residence. By the early 1990s, however, there had been a marked deterioration in the quality of the Upper Ward, in particular the State Apartments. Generations of repairs and replacements had resulted in a "diminution of the richness with which they had first been decorated", a "gradual attrition of the original vibrancy of effect, as each change repeated a more faded version of the last". A programme of repair work to replace the heating and the wiring of the Upper Ward began in 1988. Work was also undertaken to underpin the motte of the Round Tower after fresh subsidence was detected in 1988, threatening the collapse of the tower.

On 20 November 1992, a major fire occurred at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread damage to the Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated as part of a long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.

Two major issues for Windsor Castle emerged following the fire. The first was a political debate in Britain as to who should pay for the repairs. Traditionally, as the property of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>, Windsor Castle was maintained, and if necessary repaired, by the British government in exchange for the profits made by the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown Estate</a>. Furthermore, like other occupied royal palaces, it was not <a href="Insurance">insured</a> on grounds of economy. At the time of the fire, however, the British press strongly argued in favour of the Queen herself being required to pay for the repairs from her private income. A solution was found in which the restoration work would be paid for by opening <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to the public at selected times of the year, and by introducing new charges for public access to the parkland surrounding Windsor. The second major issue concerned how to repair the castle. Some suggested that the damaged rooms should be restored to their original appearance, but others favoured repairing the castle so as to incorporate modern designs. The decision was taken to largely follow the pre-fire architecture with some changes to reflect modern tastes and cost, but fresh questions emerged over whether the restoration should be undertaken to "authentic" or "equivalent" restoration standards. Modern methods were used at Windsor to reproduce the equivalent pre-fire appearance, partially due to the cost. The restoration programme was completed in 1997 at a total cost of £37 million (£67 million in 2015 terms).

Windsor Castle, part of the <a href="List%20of%20British%20royal%20residences%23Crown-owned">Occupied Royal Palaces Estate</a>, is owned by Queen <a href="Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Elizabeth II</a> in right of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>, and day-to-day management is by the <a href="Royal%20Households%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Royal Household</a>. In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">President Mbeki</a> of South Africa, <a href="Abdullah%20II%20of%20Jordan">King Abdullah II</a> of Jordan and <a href="Barack%20Obama">President Obama</a> of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The <a href="Waterloo%20ceremony">Waterloo ceremony</a> is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor">St George's Chapel</a>. While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis. The <a href="Royal%20Ascot">Royal Ascot procession</a> leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.

During the Queen's tenure much has been done, not only to restore and maintain the fabric of the building, but also to transform it into a major British <a href="Tourism%20in%20England">tourist</a> attraction, containing a significant portion of the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a> of art, which is managed from Windsor. <a href="Archaeology%20of%20Windsor%20Castle">Archaeological work has continued at the castle</a>, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988 to 1992 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with <a href="Security%20of%20Windsor%20Castle">security issues</a> and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large <a href="water%20turbine">water turbine</a>s were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide <a href="Hydropower">hydroelectric</a> power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the <a href="Royal%20Collection%20Trust">Royal Collection Trust</a> is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new café that will be housed in the 14th-century undercroft. The project is scheduled for completion at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.

Enta da Stage

Enta da Stage is the debut album of <a href="Music%20of%20the%20United%20States">American</a> <a href="East%20Coast%20hip%20hop">East Coast hip hop</a> group <a href="Black%20Moon%20%28group%29">Black Moon</a>, released on October 19, 1993 through <a href="Nervous%20Records%20%28US%29">Nervous Records</a>. The album was produced by <a href="Black%20Moon%20%28hip%20hop%20group%29">DJ Evil Dee</a> and Mr. Walt of <a href="Da%20Beatminerz">Da Beatminerz</a>. "Enta da Stage" features the debut of <a href="underground%20hip%20hop">underground hip hop</a> duo <a href="Smif-N-Wessun">Smif-N-Wessun</a>, as well as appearances from <a href="Havoc%20%28Mobb%20Deep%29">Havoc</a> of <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a> and <a href="Dru%20Ha">Dru Ha</a>, the co-founder of <a href="Duck%20Down%20Records">Duck Down Records</a>.

Despite being critically acclaimed and having two singles that charted on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> ("Who Got da Props?" and "I Got Cha Opin"), the album sold poorly, and is often overlooked in favor of subsequent East Coast albums such as "<a href="Enter%20the%20Wu-Tang%20%2836%20Chambers%29">Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</a>", "<a href="Illmatic">Illmatic</a>", "<a href="Liquid%20Swords">Liquid Swords</a>", "<a href="Ready%20to%20Die">Ready to Die</a>", "<a href="Only%20Built%204%20Cuban%20Linx...">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...</a>", and "<a href="The%20Infamous">The Infamous</a>". Nonetheless, "Enta da Stage" preceded those releases and served as a precursor to the <a href="East%20Coast%20hip%20hop%23Renaissance%20%281990s%29">resurgence of the New York hip hop scene</a> in the mid-1990s.

The roots of Black Moon go back to <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20high%20schools%20in%20New%20York%20City">Bushwick High School</a>, where 5 ft and DJ Evil Dee met and formed a group called Unique Image. The two later met <a href="Buckshot%20%28rapper%29">Buckshot</a> in the <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Brooklyn">Brownsville</a> section of Brooklyn, and formed a friendship based on similar musical aspirations. The newly formed group recruited Evil Dee's older brother Mr. Walt, and began recording the pre-production of their debut album at the Dewgarde Crib of Hits at Mr. Walt's house. Their first group release was their 1992 single "Who Got da Props?", which is now hailed as a classic hip hop single. Black Moon signed to Nervous Records in 1992, based on the strength of the debut single, which peaked at number 86 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart in early 1993. Buckshot soon formed a close relationship with Nervous employee Drew Friedman, later known as <a href="Dru%20Ha">Dru Ha</a>. The two formed a management company named "Duck Down Management", and oversaw the release of "Enta da Stage" as co-executive producers. The group finished recording "Enta da Stage" at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="D%26amp%3BD%20Studios">D&D Studios</a> between late 1992 and early 1993, and prepared it for a late 1993 release date.

Much of the acclaim the album received was due to the performance of lead MC Buckshot, who originally went by the name Buckshot Shorty. Ten of the fourteen tracks on the album are Buckshot solo tracks, and he appears on every song but "Son Get Wrec". Buck, who was eighteen at the time of the recording, was a young man trying to establish himself and his crew in the hip hop world. In a 2005 interview with MVRemix.com, Buckshot described a day in his life while recording his debut:

The mindstate described in the above interview rules the content on the album, as the lyrics are loaded with violent narratives and braggadocio and little else, as Buckshot and 5 ft try to solidify their status in rap. <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>'s Chris Witt stated that "Emcees Buckshot and 5ft Accelerator attack their verses with an aggressive <a href="nihilism">nihilism</a> not heard since <a href="Kool%20G%20Rap">Kool G Rap</a>'s peak." 5 ft, originally known as 5FT Accelerator, appears on three tracks here, and his lyrical content does not differ from that of Buckshot's. Unlike later work by New York City peers like <a href="Nas">Nas</a>, the lyrical content found here does not peer deeply into social issues or provide much substance. Allmusic's album review stated that "Theirs is a grim reality, filled with guns, <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">weed</a> and violence. Buckshot displays none of the usual <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangster</a> remorse, he is a willful public menace."

Buckshot was praised not only for his lyricism, but also for his lyrical delivery and breath control, with his flow and dramatic, conversational vocal tones being seen as original and entertaining. In a 2005 interview with AllHipHop.com, <a href="hip%20hop%20producer">hip hop producer</a> <a href="9th%20Wonder">9th Wonder</a> stated that Buckshot's style strongly influenced his current sound, and that the singles "Who Got da Props?" and "How Many MC's..." changed his life.

The album features an original style of <a href="refrain">choruses</a>, which are now known as "Black Moon hooks", in which they gather a large number of people in the booth to simultaneously yell the lyrics. These vocals were provided by a number of artists, including <a href="Smif-n-Wessun">Smif-n-Wessun</a>, Mr. Walt, <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a>'s <a href="Havoc%20%28Mobb%20Deep%29">Havoc</a> and the trio themselves. "Niguz Talk Shit", "Who Got da Props?", "Ack Like U Want It", "Buck Em Down", "Black Smif-n-Wessun", "Son Get Wrec", "Make Munne" and "U da Man" all feature "Black Moon hooks".

DJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt of <a href="Da%20Beatminerz">Da Beatminerz</a>, who produced the album, put their <a href="sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">samplers</a> to use here, lacing the album with their signature basement sound, filled with hard drums, grimy horn arrangements and deep basslines. In the album's <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a>, DJ Evil Dee stated: "This album was done on blunted terms. Anyone who is offended by the contents of the album, FUCK YOU. Nuff said." Allmusic describes the dark production: "The Beatminerz production crew craft subterranean beats to match Buckshot's mayhem. The tracks are dark, layered with muted jazz samples, and seemingly bottomless." A few of the samples used here were later recreated by a number of hip hop artists in the 1990s. The single "Buck Em Down" features a sample from <a href="Donald%20Byrd">Donald Byrd</a>'s "Wind Parade", a sample which was later re-used for <a href="Organized%20Konfusion">Organized Konfusion</a>'s 1994 concept track "Stray Bullet". "How Many MC's..." features a sample from <a href="Grover%20Washington%2C%20Jr.">Grover Washington, Jr.</a>'s "Hydra", which was used for earlier hip hop tracks like <a href="EPMD">EPMD</a>'s "Underground". The iconic "Who Got Da Props" heavily utilizes a looped sample from <a href="Ronnie%20Laws">Ronnie Laws</a>'s jazz classic "Tidal Wave", which was featured in several hip-hop and R&B tracks, including <a href="Usher%20%28singer%29">Usher</a>'s "Think Of You" from his self-titled 1994 album. Evil Dee and Walt take a portion of the sample and craft it into a different loop.

An "Enta da Stage" review on OhWord.com praises the production work, stating "Though the album's success is largely attributable to Buckshot's performance, one cannot ignore the phenomenal production from the Beatminerz. They took the already dark sound of "<a href="The%20Low%20End%20Theory">The Low End Theory</a>" and one-upped it, filtering out almost all <a href="Treble%20%28sound%29">treble</a> and using spare, hardcore drum samples. The compositions of Mr. Walt and Evil Dee are also cleverly structured, propelling Buckshot's raps directly into the listener's psyche."..."The crackle of scratched vinyl pervades the album, contributing to the feel of warmth and timelessness. Thanks to the Beatminerz, there is something inviting about "Enta da Stage", despite its confrontational lyrics."

"Enta da Stage" featured four singles and <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s, including their debut "Who Got da Props?". In mid-1993, the "How Many MC's..." single was released; it became popular in the underground rap circuit, but was not able to find success with mainstream audiences, barely breaking into the Top 50 on the <a href="Hot%20Rap%20Tracks">Hot Rap Singles</a> chart. The third single from the album was a <a href="remix">remix</a> of "I Got Cha Opin", which utilized a <a href="smooth%20jazz">smooth jazz</a> sample, courtesy of <a href="Barry%20White">Barry White</a>'s "Playing Your Game Baby". The remix featured a new chorus and all-new verses to go along with the new production. The single became the group's second "Billboard" Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at number 93. <a href="Q-Tip%20%28musician%29">Q-Tip</a> of <a href="a%20Tribe%20Called%20Quest">a Tribe Called Quest</a> gave a shout-out to the song on the Quest track "Jam", saying "Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open".

The last single, "Buck Em Down", was released in mid-1994, with the music video featuring the remixed version. Both original and remixed versions featured sampled portions from <a href="Donald%20Byrd">Donald Byrd</a>'s "Wind Parade" and similar lyrics, with the remix featuring a different vocal delivery and edited lyrics.

The album spawned additional remixes. Along with "Buck Em Down" and "I Got Cha Opin", the tracks "Ack like U Want It", "Son Get Wrec", "Shit Iz Real", "How Many MC's..." and "U da Man" all featured remixes, which were later included on Black Moon's "<a href="Diggin%27%20in%20dah%20Vaults">Diggin' in dah Vaults</a>" compilation.

"Enta da Stage" has received generally favorable reviews from most music critics and publications. Allmusic gave the album 4½ stars out of 5, while "<a href="The%20Source%20%28magazine%29">The Source</a>" gave it 4 out of 5 Mics. In 1998, the album was selected as one of "The Source"'s 100 Best Rap Albums, and former "Source" magazine writer Cheo H. Coker stated in their November 1993 issue:

Though praised for its originality and production, "Enta da Stage" has also seen criticism for its monotony and lack of lyrical substance. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine gave the album a 3-star rating, and criticized the release for "ignorance", and claimed that the release failed to capitalize on its promise, stating that "They leave blank the ultimate canvas – the self." In naming it the fourth greatest album on <a href="About.com">About.com</a>'s list of the Best Rap Albums of 1993, columnist Henry Adaso wrote of the album favorably, stating "Unlike most hip-hop albums of its era, "Enta Da Stage" eschewed confrontational raps and opted for brooding, electrifying brand of hip-hop."

Though not as widely heralded as similar groundbreaking East Coast albums such as <a href="Nas">Nas</a>' "<a href="Illmatic">Illmatic</a>", <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s "<a href="Ready%20to%20Die">Ready to Die</a>", <a href="Wu-Tang%20Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>'s "<a href="Enter%20the%20Wu-Tang%20%2836%20Chambers%29">Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</a>", <a href="Onyx%20%28band%29">Onyx</a>'s "<a href="Bacdafucup">Bacdafucup</a>" and <a href="Mobb%20Deep">Mobb Deep</a>'s "<a href="The%20Infamous">The Infamous</a>", "Enta da Stage" was critically acclaimed on a similar level. Though all of the albums mentioned above were able to reach at least <a href="RIAA%20certification">Gold status</a>, "Enta da Stage", released before all of these albums, has not sold nearly as well, selling just over 350,000 copies in the U.S. as of June 2006. Allmusic described the importance of the album: "It set the tone for much of the hip hop to follow. <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">Biggie Smalls</a> suicidal thoughts and <a href="N.O.R.E.">Noreaga</a>'s boisterous thuggery both have their roots here. The album marked a turning point in hip hop." "Enta da Stage" has also been described as "Era defining", and was one of the pioneering releases during the return of New York City's street hip hop resurgence of the mid 1990s, after the <a href="West%20Coast%20hip%20hop">West Coast</a>'s reign of the early 1990s. "Enta da Stage" is still prominent among hip hop artists today, such as lyrics from "How Many MC's..." being used as a hook for <a href="Jedi%20Mind%20Tricks">Jedi Mind Trick's</a> song "Speech Cobras".

The album also served as the introduction of the <a href="Supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> <a href="Boot%20Camp%20Clik">Boot Camp Clik</a>. The collective was a prominent underground rap group in the 1990s – also producing the acclaimed <a href="Smif-n-Wessun">Smif-n-Wessun</a>'s "<a href="Dah%20Shinin%27">Dah Shinin'</a>", <a href="Heltah%20Skeltah">Heltah Skeltah</a>'s "<a href="Nocturnal%20%28Heltah%20Skeltah%20album%29">Nocturnal</a>", and <a href="O.G.C.">O.G.C.</a>'s "<a href="Da%20Storm">Da Storm</a>". "Enta da Stage" heralded the debut of <a href="Da%20Beatminerz">Da Beatminerz</a>. After producing here, and on other Boot Camp albums "Dah Shinin"', "Nocturnal" and "Da Storm", Mr. Walt and Evil Dee went on to expand their sounds, and produce for popular artists like <a href="Afu-Ra">Afu-Ra</a>, <a href="Big%20Daddy%20Kane">Big Daddy Kane</a>, <a href="Craig%20G">Craig G</a>, <a href="De%20La%20Soul">De La Soul</a>, <a href="Dilated%20Peoples">Dilated Peoples</a>, <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="Flipmode%20Squad">Flipmode Squad</a>, <a href="Jean%20Grae">Jean Grae</a>, <a href="KRS-One">KRS-One</a>, <a href="M.O.P.">M.O.P.</a>, <a href="Naughty%20by%20Nature">Naughty by Nature</a>, <a href="O.C.%20%28rapper%29">O.C.</a> and <a href="Black%20Star%20%28hip%20hop%20group%29">Black Star</a>. The album is extensively broken down track-by-track by <a href="Buckshot%20%28rapper%29">Buckshot</a>, <a href="DJ%20Evil%20Dee">DJ Evil Dee</a>, and Mr. Walt of <a href="Da%20Beatminerz">Da Beatminerz</a> in Brian Coleman's book "<a href="Check%20the%20Technique">Check the Technique</a>" (2007).

The Oceanides

The Oceanides (Finnish title: , translated to English as "Nymphs of the Waves" or "Spirits of the Waves"; original working title " "; in English, "Rondo of the Waves"), <a href="Opus%20number">Op.</a> 73, is a single-<a href="movement%20%28music%29">movement</a> <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> for <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a> written in by the Finnish composer <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Jean Sibelius</a>. The piece, which refers to the <a href="Oceanid">nymphs</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> who inhabited the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, premiered on 4 June 1914 at the <a href="Norfolk%20Chamber%20Music%20Festival">Norfolk Music Festival</a> in Connecticut with Sibelius conducting. Praised upon its premiere as "the finest evocation of the sea ... ever ... produced in music", the tone poem, in <a href="D%20major">D major</a>, consists of two <a href="subject%20%28music%29">subjects</a>, said to represent the playful activity of the nymphs and the majesty of the ocean, respectively. Sibelius gradually develops this material over three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.

Stylistically, many commentators have described "The Oceanides" as either an outright example of <a href="Impressionism%20%28music%29">Impressionism</a> or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active development of the two subjects, his sparing use of <a href="scale%20%28music%29">scale</a>s favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy's</a> "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>".

Aside from the definitive D major tone poem, two intermediate versions of "The Oceanides" survive: the first, a three-movement <a href="orchestral%20suite">orchestral suite</a>, in <a href="E-flat%20major">E major</a>, that dates to 1913 (movement No. 1 lost); and the second, the initial single-movement "Yale" version of the tone poem, in <a href="D-flat%20major">D major</a>, which Sibelius dispatched to America in advance of his journey but revised prior to the music festival. "The Oceanides" thus stands alongside ', the ', the <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Sibelius%29">Violin Concerto</a>, and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B5%20%28Sibelius%29">Fifth Symphony</a> as one of Sibelius's most overhauled works. The suite and Yale version, never performed in the composer's lifetime, received their world premieres by <a href="Osmo%20V%C3%A4nsk%C3%A4">Osmo Vänskä</a> and the <a href="Lahti%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Lahti Symphony Orchestra</a> on 10 September and 24 October 2002, respectively. A typical performance of the final version lasts about 10 minutes, some 3 minutes longer than its Yale predecessor.

In August 1913, Sibelius received a message from the American composer and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> professor <a href="Horatio%20Parker">Horatio Parker</a>: a <a href="New%20England">New England</a> patron of the arts, Carl Stoeckel (1858–1925), and his wife, Ellen Stoeckel née Battell (1851–1939), had authorized $1,000 for the commission of a new symphonic poem from Sibelius, per Parker's recommendation. The piece, not to exceed fifteen minutes in length, was to be played at the 1914 <a href="Norfolk%20Chamber%20Music%20Festival">Norfolk Music Festival</a> in Connecticut, which the Stoeckels annually hosted (and financed) at their estate in a wooden performance hall dubbed "The Music Shed". Despite his ongoing struggles with another commission, incidental music to <a href="Poul%20Knudsen%20%28writer%29">Poul Knudsen</a>'s tragic <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "<a href="Scaramouche%20%28Sibelius%29">Scaramouche</a>", Sibelius accepted the Stoeckel offer, writing in his diary, "A symphonic poem, ready by April".

In early September, another letter from Parker arrived saying that Stockel wished to provide the copyist's fee for writing out the orchestral parts in Finland. As 1913 drew to a close, Sibelius had not made much progress on the American commission, having spent the entire autumn on other pieces and revisions. A trip to Berlin in January 1914 followed, and Sibelius's diary and correspondence indicate the Stoeckel commission was at the forefront of his mind; an initial plan to set <a href="Viktor%20Rydberg">Rydberg's</a> poem "Fantasos and Sulamit" subsequently was discarded. His stay in Berlin was not productive, and in mid-February he returned to Helsinki ("Uneasy because of the America thing [Norfolk commission]. Presumably have to go home to my cell in order to be able to concentrate".)

Today, three versions of the work survive. Initially in 1913, Sibelius conceived of the commission as a three-movement suite for orchestra in <a href="E-flat%20major">E major</a>, of which only No. 2 ("Tempo moderato") and No. 3 ("Allegro") are <a href="%23Relation%20to%20The%20Bard">extant</a>. At some point in 1913–14, Sibelius decided to rework the thematic material of the "Allegro", very much a "work in progress", into a single-movement symphonic poem; the musical content of the "Tempo moderato" would find its way into the piano piece "" ("To Longing"), JS 202. In making the transition from suite to tone poem, Sibelius <a href="transposition%20%28music%29">transposed</a> the material from E to <a href="D-flat%20major">D major</a>; in addition, he also introduced new musical ideas, such as the rocking wave-like motif in the <a href="string%20section">strings</a> and <a href="woodwind%20section">woodwinds</a>, and expanded the orchestration.

In April 1914, Sibelius mailed the <a href="Sheet%20music%23Full%20scores%2C%20variants%20and%20condensations">score</a> and parts to the United States, calling the piece " " (this intermediate version of the tone poem is commonly referred to as the "Yale" version). On 12 and 20 April 1914, Parker wrote on behalf of Stoeckel, expanding upon the initial agreement: Sibelius's American patron now wished him to travel to and conduct a program of his music at the Norfolk festival; as compensation, Sibelius would receive $1,200, as well as an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> of music from Yale University. Although he already had sent the manuscript to Norfolk, Sibelius was not satisfied with the score and immediately began to revise the piece, eventually opting for a complete overhaul ("Isn't it just like me to rework the tone poem—at the moment I am ablaze with it."). Although Sibelius was prone to revising his compositions, such effort was usually undertaken when preparing a piece for publication or after having heard it first performed in concert. With respect to the Yale version, it is possible the invitation to attend the music festival in person prompted Sibelius to "reassess" the tone poem with a more critical eye.

The differences between the first and final versions of the tone poem are substantial; not only did Sibelius again transpose the piece, into D major, but he also added the wave-crash climax. Despite these changes, the orchestration is more or less the same, with the addition of one trumpet. As the trip to America approached, Sibelius raced to complete the revisions in time. <a href="Aino%20Sibelius">Aino Sibelius</a>, the composer's wife, recounts the scenes at <a href="Ainola">Ainola</a>:

Sibelius continued to make changes to the final version of the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship "<a href="SS%20Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">SS Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>" and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, "It's as though I have found myself, and more besides. The <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B4%20%28Sibelius%29">Fourth Symphony</a> was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the <a href="Lahti%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Lahti Symphony Orchestra</a> on 19 September and 24 October 2002, respectively.

Sibelius appears to have vacillated over a name for the new tone poem. By 3 April 1914 he had dropped " " in favor of '. On 29 April he wrote to Parker in favor of the original title ("Herr Doctor, now you must forgive me for performing the new tone poem in its final version with the original title " ". The version "Aallottaret" that I sent to you can stay with Mr. Stoeckel".). This position, too, proved fleeting. By the end of May, Sibelius had settled on ', and the tone poem appeared under this title, albeit misspelled, on the 4 June Norfolk Festival program: " "[sic]"—Tone Poem (Nymphs of the Ocean)". In preparation for the publication of the tone poem by <a href="Breitkopf%20%26amp%3B%20H%C3%A4rtel">Breitkopf & Härtel</a> in June 1915, Sibelius included alongside the Finnish title, ', an "explanatory" German translation, ' (in English: "The Oceanides"). The piece was published as Op. 73 and dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stoeckel.

The tone poem premiered on 4 June 1914 at "The Shed" concert hall of the Norfolk Music Festival, Sibelius himself conducting at a podium decorated in the American and Finnish national colors. The orchestra, which Sibelius praised as "wonderful ... surpasses anything we have in Europe", comprised musicians drawn from three of America's best music societies: the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a>, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera Orchestra</a>, and the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>. "The Oceanides" was unlike anything the musicians had previously encountered. "I think they did not understand it all at first from what they said", Stoeckel recalled. "The next morning, after having run it through three times, they were thoroughly delighted with it and remarked that the beauty of the music grew with each rehearsal". The festival public sounded a similarly positive note about the new piece, which concluded a concert of Sibelius's music that included "<a href="Pohjola%27s%20Daughter">Pohjola's Daughter</a>", the "<a href="King%20Christian%20II%20%28Sibelius%29">King Christian II Suite</a>", "<a href="The%20Swan%20of%20Tuonela">The Swan of Tuonela</a>", "<a href="Finlandia">Finlandia</a>", and "<a href="Valse%20triste%20%28Sibelius%29">Valse triste</a>". Stoeckel recounts the events of 4 June:

Everyone who was fortunate enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him ... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the "honor we had done him".

Upon conclusion of the second half of the program (which featured <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Dvořák's</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B9%20%28Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k%29">Ninth Symphony</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Coleridge-Taylor">Coleridge-Taylor's</a> rhapsody "From the Prairie", and the overture to <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner's</a> opera "<a href="Die%20Feen">Die Feen</a>"), the orchestra performed the Finnish national anthem, "".

With the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> on 28 July 1914, "The Oceanides" languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a> and the United States: in <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>, there was little demand for the music of an "enemy national", while in <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, Finns were viewed as being "less than loyal subjects of the Tsar". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to <a href="Erik%20W.%20Tawaststjerna">Tawaststjerna</a>, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B6%20%28Sibelius%29">Sixth</a> symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself "forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness".

Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer <a href="Wilhelm%20Stenhammar">Wilhelm Stenhammar</a>, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the <a href="Gothenburg%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra</a>, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a "major work" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, "My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 ("I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come".).

Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of "The Oceanides". For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an "artist on tour", feeding off the energy and "rapturous ovations" of an audience (it had been nine months since the Norfolk concerts, which now seemed a distant memory). The first concert, on March 22, featured the <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2%20%28Sibelius%29">Second Symphony</a>, "Scènes historiques II", and two movements from "Swanwhite" before concluding with "The Oceanides". According to Sibelius's diary, the performance was a "great success", with Stenhammar "captivated" particularly by the final number. The 24 March program retained "The Oceanides", but paired it with "Scènes historiques I", the "Nocturne" from the "King Christian II Suite", a movement from "", " Return", and the Fourth Symphony. Sibelius was very pleased with the orchestra's handling of "The Oceanides", calling its performance "wonderful". He goes on to note in his diary that, "After the final number ["The Oceanides"] there was a deafening torrent of applause, stamps, cries of bravo, a standing ovation and fanfares from the orchestra".

The Finnish premiere of "The Oceanides" occurred on the occasion of Sibelius's fiftieth birthday celebration on 8 December 1915 at the Great Hall of the <a href="University%20of%20Helsinki">University of Helsinki</a>, with Sibelius conducting the <a href="Helsinki%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The program, which "The Oceanides" opened, also included the two Serenades for violin and orchestra (Op. 69, <a href="Richard%20Burgin">Richard Burgin</a> was the soloist) and, most importantly, the world premiere of the Fifth Symphony, at that time still in four movements. The birthday program was well received, and Sibelius twice repeated it, once at the <a href="Finnish%20National%20Theatre">Finnish National Theatre</a> on 12 December and then again at the University of Helsinki on 18 December. The celebrations continued into the new year, with Sibelius conducting "The Oceanides" at a concert in Finland's Folketshus on 9 January 1916. The tone poem was also taken up in the spring by Sibelius's brother-in-law, <a href="Armas%20J%C3%A4rnefelt">Armas Järnefelt</a>, who led the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Opera">Stockholm Opera Orchestra</a>. <a href="Robert%20Kajanus">Robert Kajanus</a> later followed with a performance of "The Oceanides" in February 1917.


"The Oceanides" is a single-movement tone poem that consists of two main subjects, A and B. The "lively" A section (in <a href="duple%20meter">duple meter</a>), first introduced by the flutes at the beginning of the piece, can be said to represent the playful activity of the nymphs. Shortly after, solo oboe and clarinet—supported by harp <a href="glissandi">glissandi</a> and strings—introduce the "majestic" B section (in <a href="triple%20meter">triple meter</a>), which brings to mind the ocean's depth and expansiveness and perhaps, at least according to Tawaststjerna, "the <a href="Poseidon">God of the Sea</a> himself". Sibelius gradually expands and deepens the two subjects, building up to an enormous (almost onomatopoeic) wave-crash climax that Daniel Grimley has characterized as a "point of textural, dynamic and chromatic saturation". Formally stated by Tawaststjerna, the tone poem structurally proceeds as follows:

Grimley interprets the piece as progressing through "a series of three generative, wave-like cycles", perhaps best described as placid ocean (A-B), gathering storm (A-B), and wave-crash climax (C-A). David Hurwitz views the structure of the piece similarly to Tawaststjerna, albeit as A-B-A-B-Coda(B-A), which he terms "<a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> without development", while Robert Layton considers "The Oceanides" "something ... of a free <a href="rondo">rondo</a>", due to the continued reappearance of the opening flute theme (A).

Critical opinion as to the merit of "The Oceanides" has been overwhelmingly positive, and today the piece is counted among Sibelius's masterpieces. Following the 1914 premiere, <a href="Olin%20Downes">Olin Downes</a>, the American music critic and Sibelius devotee, described the new work as "the finest evocation of the sea which has ever been produced in music", praising the composer for his "extraordinarily developed feeling for form, proportion and continuity". Downes furthermore assessed Sibelius's Norfolk concert as just the third time since 1900 that he had "felt himself in the presence of a genius of world class" (the other two being <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> in 1904 and <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> in 1910). An unsigned review in the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" (almost certainly penned by critic <a href="Henry%20Krehbiel">Henry Krehbiel</a>) found the new work "fresh and vital, full of imagination and strong in climax". He continues:

Extremists will probably deplore the fact that the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret ... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.

The influential Swedish critic <a href="Wilhelm%20Peterson-Berger">Wilhelm Peterson-Berger</a>, always a thorn in Sibelius's side and whom the composer had once mocked as "his lordship", required some three encounters with "The Oceanides" before warming to the new symphonic poem: after hearing the <a href="Royal%20Stockholm%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Stockholm Concert Society</a> under Sibelius in 1923, Peterson-Berger at last embraced the piece. ""The Oceanides" was totally and completely different from three years ago under <a href="Georg%20Schn%C3%A9evoigt">Schnéevoigt</a>", he wrote. "In this beautiful poem one really heard something of the sound of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>".

The composer (and former Sibelius pupil) <a href="Leevi%20Madetoja">Leevi Madetoja</a> further praised the score upon review, writing in "<a href="Uusi%20Suometar">Uusi Suometar</a>" in July 1914 that Sibelius, rather than "repeat[ing] endlessly" the style of his previous works, had yet again shown his penchant for "renewing himself musically ... always forward, striving for new aims". The Finnish critic Karl Wasenius (aka BIS), writing in "<a href="Hufvudstadsbladet">Hufvudstadsbladet</a>" after the birthday celebration performances of 1915, wrote approvingly of Sibelius's "refined mastery" of technique. "Not a single note is wasted on brash effects", Wasenius continued. "Yet mighty things are still achieved. Sibelius gives us the expanse and magnitude of the ocean, its powerful wave-song but without boastful gestures. He is too noble for that". In "Tidning för musik", <a href="Otto%20Andersson%20%28musicologist%29">Otto Anderssen</a> interpreted Sibelius's latest compositions (among them "The Oceanides") as yet another indicator that he was among the most forward-looking modernists: "Sibelius is, I believe, a man of the future ... constantly ahead of his time. Now he stands at the heights where the horizon stretches out over fields which the rest of us cannot yet see". <a href="Cecil%20Gray%20%28composer%29">Cecil Gray</a>, moreover, calls the piece "daring" and applauds the score's "exceptional complexity and refinement", challenging critics who see Sibelius as a "primitive artist".

Later commentators also found much to praise in "The Oceanides." Guy Rickards describes the tone poem as an "extraordinary score", magnificent yet subtle in its depiction of the sea's various moods, but nonetheless "music suffused by light", while Robert Layton sees the piece as "far more ambitious and highly organized in design" than its immediate predecessor, "<a href="The%20Bard%20%28Sibelius%29">The Bard</a>". Tawaststjerna notes Sibelius's success at characterizing the sea: the "playful flutes" that bring the oceanides to life but which feel "alien" in the landscape's vastness; the "powerful swell" of wind and water conveyed by oboe and clarinet over undulating strings and harp glissandi; the sustained wind chord symbolizing the "limitless expanse of the sea"; and, the "mighty climax" of the storm, the final wave crash which "always exceeds one's expectations". The Finnish composer <a href="Kalevi%20Aho">Kalevi Aho</a> has argued in favor of the D major Yale version, feeling as though the piece loses "something essential" in terms of orchestral color in D major: "The orchestral tone in D major is veiled, somehow mysterious and impressionistic. Compared with it D major sounds clearer, but also more matter-of-fact". The conductor Osmo Vänskä also has noted the difference between the two keys, comparing the D major version to a "large lake" and the D major to a "mighty ocean".

Stylistically, many commentators have described "The Oceanides" as broadly <a href="Impressionism%20in%20music">impressionistic</a>, in particular drawing comparisons with <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy's</a> "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>". Harold Johnson, for example, writes that the themes and orchestration of the piece, with muted string <a href="tremolo">tremolo</a>s and harp glissandi, "bear more than a superficial resemblance" to Debussy's style (he further suggests that Sibelius may have feared his original title, " ", was "too close to Debussy"). Gray, who calls the orchestral technique in "The Oceanides" "strikingly different" from anything else in Sibelius's oeuvre, stresses that the work is far from "derivative". Rather, he argues that Sibelius builds upon and revolutionizes the French impressionist technique, making it "entirely his own, and not merely a reflection or distortion of Debussy". Gray continues:

While conceding the impressionistic feel of "The Oceanides", Nils-Eric Ringbom warns that the comparison with Debussy should not be taken too far. Whereas in Debussy's works "there is seldom anything that grows thematically or undergoes development" (instead, Debussy marvels the listener with "his mastery in rendering dreamy, passive moods and fleeting, restrained emotions"), Sibelius places "too much weight on the logical development of his musical ideas to let ... them flicker out in the empty nothingness of thematic instability"; in other words, he insists that "atmospheric background swallow neither action nor structure". Sibelius's impressionism is thus "far more ... active" than Debussy's.

Other commentators have cautioned against the conclusion that "The Oceanides" is either an example of impressionism or somehow stylistically indebted to Debussy. Tawaststjerna, for example, believes that the piece's "anchorage in the major-minor harmony and the relatively sparing use of modal and whole-tone formulae" indicates that the tone poem "belongs to the world of late romanticism", the impressionistic character of its texture, harmonic vocabulary, and rhythmic patterns notwithstanding. Hurwitz has likewise criticized the "roaring cataract of nonsense in the Sibelius literature" about the influence of the French impressionists on the composer. "Similar musical problems often produce similar solutions", Hurwitz notes. "In this case, any symphonic portrait of the ocean is bound to rely more on texture and color than on vocal melody, for the simple reason that the ocean is not a person and does not sing ... nor does it lend itself to ... [an] <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> approach ...". Layton detects the presence of "normal Sibelian procedures and techniques" in "The Oceanides", dismissing any serious debt to Debussy. "Its growth from the opening bars onward is profoundly organic", Layton writes. "And its apparent independence from the rest of Sibelius's work is manifest only at a superficial level".

"The Oceanides" traces back to sketches for a three-movement suite for orchestra in E major that Sibelius likely had begun in 1913; today, only No. 2 (Tempo moderato) and No. 3 (Allegro) survive. Andrew Barnett has speculated as to the whereabouts of the lost first movement from the pre-"Oceanides" suite. Although it is likely the opening number was either misplaced or destroyed by the composer, Barnett argues that four pieces of "circumstantial evidence" indicate the movement has survived—albeit in different form—as the tone poem "<a href="The%20Bard%20%28Sibelius%29">The Bard</a>", written in 1913 and revised the following year:


Despite its "haunting beauty", "The Oceanides" has received fewer recordings than more famous Sibelius tone poems such as "", "The Swan of Tuonela", and "<a href="Tapiola%20%28Sibelius%29">Tapiola</a>". The first recording of "The Oceanides" was made in 1936 with <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> conducting the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a>, a performance that is noticeably quicker than average. To date, the only recordings of the Yale version (7:25) and the pre-"Oceanides" suite (No. 2 "Tempo moderato", 2:42; No. 3 "Allegro", 4:35) are by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra under the BIS label (<a href="http%3A//www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp%3Fitem_code%3DBIS-CD-1445">BIS-CD-1445, "Rondo of the Waves"</a>); both were recorded in January 2003. The album premiered to considerable acclaim. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian's</a>" Andrew Clements labeled the record the best of 2003, noting that the early versions of "The Oceanides" permitted the listener to see "the mechanics of musical genius laid bare".

Youngstown Ohio Works

The Youngstown Ohio Works baseball team was a <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league</a> club that was known for winning the premier championship of the <a href="Ohio%E2%80%93Pennsylvania%20League">Ohio–Pennsylvania League</a> in 1905, and for launching the professional career of <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Roy%20Castleton">Roy Castleton</a> a year later. A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship.

During its brief span of activity, the Ohio Works team faced challenges that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, including weak financial support for teams. Following a dispute over funding, the team's owners sold the club to outside investors, just a few months before the opening of the 1907 season.

The club's strong record and regional visibility spurred the growth of amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area, and the community's minor league teams produced notable players throughout the first half of the 20th century. In the late 1990s, this tradition was rekindled, with the establishment of the <a href="Mahoning%20Valley%20Scrappers">Mahoning Valley Scrappers</a>, a minor league team based in neighboring <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a>.

The Ohio Works team was organized in <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown</a>, in 1902, under the sponsorship of <a href="Joseph%20A.%20McDonald">Joseph A. McDonald</a>, superintendent of the Ohio Works of the <a href="Carnegie%20Steel%20Company">Carnegie Steel Company</a>. In 1905, the club joined the Class C Division, Ohio–Pennsylvania League, which was founded that year in <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>, by veteran ballplayer <a href="Charlie%20Morton%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201854%29">Charlie Morton</a>. The league's Ohio members included clubs from Akron, <a href="Barberton%2C%20Ohio">Barberton</a>, <a href="Bucyrus%2C%20Ohio">Bucyrus</a>, <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton</a>, <a href="Kent%2C%20Ohio">Kent</a>, <a href="Lima%2C%20Ohio">Lima</a>, <a href="Massillon%2C%20Ohio">Massillon</a>, <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Ohio">Mount Vernon</a>, <a href="Newark%2C%20Ohio">Newark</a>, Niles, <a href="Steubenville%2C%20Ohio">Steubenville</a>, <a href="Washington%2C%20Ohio">Washington</a>, <a href="Wooster%2C%20Ohio">Wooster</a>, Youngstown, and <a href="Zanesville%2C%20Ohio">Zanesville</a>, while Pennsylvania was initially represented by teams from <a href="Braddock%2C%20Pennsylvania">Braddock</a>, <a href="Butler%2C%20Pennsylvania">Butler</a>, <a href="Homestead%2C%20Pennsylvania">Homestead</a>, and <a href="Sharon%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sharon</a>. Within the first two weeks of the season, clubs from <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster</a> and <a href="McKeesport%2C%20Pennsylvania">McKeesport</a> also joined the league. Only eight of the original 21 participating clubs finished the 1905 season, however. These included clubs from Akron, Homestead, Lancaster, Newark, Niles, Sharon, Youngstown, and Zanesville. The name, "Youngstown Ohio Works", became officially associated with the Youngstown team when it joined the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. From the outset, the Youngstown ball club was managed by ex-major leaguer <a href="Marty%20Hogan">Marty Hogan</a>, a former <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> for the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns%20%28NL%29">St. Louis Browns</a>.

The team opened the 1905 season with an unexpected 4–1 loss to the Canton Protectives, inspiring a local newspaper to comment that the Youngstown team made "as many errors as hits while Canton fielded almost perfectly and hit opportunely". The Ohio Works club gained steam, however, and began to win games. On May 11, 1905, the Youngstown team garnered controversy when "The Akron Times-Democrat" reported that the Ohio Works' sponsors provided player salaries that nearly doubled those offered by other clubs in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. In a report on the outcry in Akron, "<a href="The%20Vindicator">The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</a>" warned that, "if the Youngstown backers keep adding and force the other clubs to add to the salaries, it is a question of only a short time until independent baseball will be an impossibility". The newspaper article concluded that the large salaries provided by the Ohio Works's sponsors placed a special burden on teams based in "smaller cities".

Competition among league participants was intense, and games were often raucous affairs. On July 16, 1905, a riot broke out during a contest with a team in neighboring Niles, Ohio. According to a newspaper account, the trouble began when two female fans became involved in a "hair-pulling fight". At one point, two "well-known men" were arrested for "taking an umbrella from a woman and breaking it after she had been annoying them with it". Finally, dozens of fans swarmed into the field, where they "pushed around the umpire and interfered with the defensive play of the Youngstown fielders".

In September 1905, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship, though sources disagree on the club's final record. This confusion may be due to the disorganized nature of the new league, with its sprawling roster of teams. According to the "Spalding Guide" (1906), "The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league". Baseball researcher Jim Holl summarizes the varied accounts as follows: ""The Reach Guide" (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84–32 won–lost record where the "Spalding Guide" of the same year list a 90–35 record. The "Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball" (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88–35 mark". Despite this uncertainty over the club's record, its championship status was not in dispute, and the team became popularly known as "the Champs". This moniker, however, was not officially connected to a Youngstown-based ball club until 1907, when it became the legal name of the Ohio Works' local successors.

By the outset of the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from <a href="New%20Castle%2C%20Pennsylvania">New Castle, Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="Mansfield%2C%20Ohio">Mansfield, Ohio</a>.

The Ohio Works team opened with 16 players, three of whom had been part of the club during the 1905 season. The team's lineup included William J. Maloney of Bradford, Kentucky; Will M. Thomas of Morristown, Pennsylvania; Tommy Thomas of <a href="Piqua%2C%20Ohio">Piqua, Ohio</a>; <a href="Lee%20Fohl">Lee Fohl</a> of <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>; Louis Schettler of <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>; "Dotty" Freck of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>; A. C. McClintock of Columbus; Roy Castleton of <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>; Lewis Groh of <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>; John Kennedy of Youngstown, Charles Crouse of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>; Roy Chase of <a href="Andover%2C%20Ohio">Andover, Ohio</a>; Forrester J. Dressner of Garrettsville, Pennsylvania; Harry Schwartz of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>; and Roy Gould of Middlesex, Pennsylvania. Other players associated with the club during the 1906 season were Edward Hilley, Curley Blount, and Charles McCloskey.

The Youngstown club kicked off the 1906 season with an exhibition game against a Cleveland team, emerging as victors in a close contest of 3–4. "Up till the closing minutes it looked like the visiting team, the Cleveland Leaders, would stow the contest away in their bat-bags and leave the field on top", the "Vindicator" reported. "The finish was exciting, and 400 fanatics who took chances on pneumonia had a chance to warm up and go home in good spirits.". The paper stated that, at the top of the first inning, the Cleveland team was leading by one point, when "the Youngstown gentlemen got busy in the most approved style". According to the "Vindicator", Ohio Works player Curley Blount "stepped in front of a slow pitched ball and was sent to third", while A. C. McClintock "stole second with all hands asleep". At this point, the paper added, "[Charles] McCloskey took another base hit and Blount and McClintock scored". The "Vindicator"'s summary of the game called attention to pitcher Roy Castleton, "who struck out all three batters in the tenth and got one in the ninth". The paper described McClintock and McCloskey (the "two Macs") as the Youngstown club's "star hitters".

Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team prepared for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games), the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator". "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game". A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of .306. Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11–8. The game's highlights included the pitching of "Long John" Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who "unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him to go all the way around".

Hogan's overall confidence in the club was rewarded. The Youngstown team closed the season with an 84–53 record and won its second consecutive Ohio–Pennsylvania League championship. The star of the Ohio Works team was a gangling, left-handed pitcher named Roy Castleton, a <a href="Utah">Utah</a> native who went on to pitch for the <a href="New%20York%20Highlanders">New York Highlanders</a> and Cincinnati Reds. On August 17, 1906, Castleton gained national recognition when he pitched a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> against rival Akron, shutting them out at 4–0. With Castleton's assistance, the Youngstown Ohio Works claimed its third consecutive Ohio state pennant, a prize distinct from the league championship.

In the wake of the Ohio Works' second league championship, steps were taken to incorporate the club. "<a href="Sporting%20Life%20%28sports%20journal%29">Sporting Life</a>" noted in December 1906 that the team's backers, Joseph and Thomas McDonald (superintendent and assistant superintendent, respectively, of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company) were compelled to invite additional investors because of planned (and costly) improvements at the steel plant. "The incorporators of the club will be Thomas McDonald, Joseph McDonald, Thomas Carr, Thomas Carter and Marty Hogan", the paper stated. "Manager Hogan will be given even more control of the team next season than he has had. Heretofore he has had the entire control of the team and transacted most of the business".

At some point, however, disagreements over funding evidently arose between the McDonald brothers and Hogan. On February 18, 1907, the "Zanesville Signal" reported that Hogan had received permission from "the Messrs. McDonald" (Joseph and Thomas) to negotiate a $3,000 deal for the sale of the team, including its players, to a group of Zanesville investors. The following day, Hogan was quoted as saying, "Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a sparrow's blanket". The ball club manager's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator" almost a week after the team's sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received "the short end of the deal". No reference was made to the club's sale.

The former Ohio Works manager was apparently not the only observer to suggest that Joseph McDonald engaged in "unsportsmanlike tactics". A feature story, that appeared in "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator" in 1920, stated that McDonald took deliberate steps in 1907 to replace the Ohio Works team with a more seasoned club from <a href="Homestead%2C%20Pennsylvania">Homestead, Pennsylvania</a>. The new club became known officially as the "<a href="Youngstown%20Champs">Youngstown Champs</a>". Rumors of McDonald's supposed strategy apparently angered local baseball fans. According to the 1920 feature article, the Youngstown media highlighted the Champs' unexpected loss to the amateur <a href="Rayen%20High%20School%20%28Youngstown%2C%20Ohio%29">Rayen</a> Athletics in 1907. At this point, however, McDonald's relationship with the club was less direct. According to "Sporting Life", the Youngstown franchise had been "declared forfeit" in early 1907, on the recommendation of the Akron club; it was subsequently "awarded" to a recently established baseball company. "This was only a formality to make legal the actions taken by Magnate [Joseph] McDonald when they turned over the old franchise to the newly organized company in Youngstown", the paper reported. In any event, the Youngstown Champs went on to win the Ohio–Pennsylvania League championship.

Meanwhile, former Ohio Works players in Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was admitted into the <a href="Pennsylvania%E2%80%93Ohio%E2%80%93Maryland%20League">Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League</a>, a Division D league. By the close of the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the <a href="Zanesville%20Infants">Zanesville Infants</a> and joined the <a href="Central%20League">Central League</a>. Further research is needed to determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.

With the exception of a few notable figures, the progress of former Ohio Works players is difficult to track. After leaving the club at the end of the 1906 season, Roy Castleton went on to pitch for the New York Highlanders and Cincinnati Reds. Lee Fohl, another noteworthy alumnus, managed the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> between 1915 and 1919. Fohl later served as manager of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a> and <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. Although Fohl was often criticized as a manager, sports journalist John J. Ward (writing in August 1924) credited him, to a large extent, for the early successes of the Red Sox, an underdog that briefly challenged the New York Yankees and <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> before slipping to seventh place in the eight-team <a href="American%20League">American League</a>. Former major leaguer Billy Phyle, who played for the Ohio Works team during the 1905 season, went on to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in 1906. A fourth ex-team member, Louis Schettler, played for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> during the 1910 season. Schettler (a Pittsburgh native) eventually settled in Youngstown, where he died in 1960.

Much is known about the subsequent career of the team's ex-manager. In 1909, Marty Hogan moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he signed future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a> pitcher <a href="Stan%20Coveleski">Stan Coveleski</a> to his first professional contract. In 1909, the <a href="Lancaster%20Red%20Roses">Lancaster Red Roses</a> worked up a 75-39 record, seizing the championship of the <a href="Tri-State%20League">Tri-State League</a>. As "Spalding's Baseball Guide" (1910) reported: "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". Hogan went on to manage clubs in Zanesville and <a href="Fond%20du%20Lac%2C%20Wisconsin">Fond du Lac, Wisconsin</a>. In 1913, during a stint in Zanesville, the manager signed pitcher <a href="Sad%20Sam%20Jones">Sam Jones</a> to his first professional contract. In the mid-1910s, Hogan permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he died in 1923, several months after being injured in an automobile accident.

The Youngstown Ohio Works team not only gave several members a "shot" at the major leagues, but it also played an indirect role in launching the career of <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a> umpire <a href="Billy%20Evans">Billy Evans</a>. On September 1, 1903, Evans, a reporter at "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator", was assigned to cover a game between the Ohio Works and the <a href="Homestead%20Library%20Athletic%20Club">Homestead Library Athletic Club</a> that was held in Youngstown. Evans took his first step toward a legendary career when club manager Hogan offered him $15 to fill an umpire vacancy. (In 1905, Evans received a major career boost from Youngstown native <a href="Jimmy%20McAleer">Jimmy McAleer</a>, who recommended Evans to the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>.)

The story of the Ohio Works team proved to be an early chapter in Youngstown's long history of amateur and minor league baseball. In the 1930s and 1940s, the city was a frequent host of the National Amateur Baseball Federation (NABF) championship. NABF officials praised the community for the condition of its sandlot <a href="baseball%20diamond">baseball diamond</a>s, which they rated as among the best in the country. During the first half of the 20th century, Youngstown-based teams provided experience and exposure to future major league players such as <a href="Everett%20Scott">Everett Scott</a>, <a href="Floyd%20Baker">Floyd Baker</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Kucab">Johnny Kucab</a>. Today, the Youngstown–Warren area is home base to the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, a minor league team that competes in the Class A <a href="New%20York%E2%80%93Penn%20League">New York–Penn League</a>.

All You Need Is Love (the JAMs song)

"All You Need Is Love" is a song by <a href="the%20Justified%20Ancients%20of%20Mu%20Mu">the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</a>, <a href="KLF%20Communications">independently released</a> as their debut single on 9 March 1987. A politically topical song concerning the British media's AIDS furore, the track was initially given a <a href="white%20label">12" white label</a> release because of its <a href="sample%20%28music%29">sampling</a> of other records.

The artistic attitude of "All You Need Is Love" epitomised that of the JAMs' subsequent recordings: making use of popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists' work, and juxtaposing these with each other, adding <a href="beatbox">beatbox</a> rhythms and <a href="Bill%20Drummond">Bill Drummond</a>'s Scottish-accented raps, poems and narrations. The JAMs' promotional tactics were similarly unconventional, including the use of promotional graffiti, a <a href="guerrilla%20communication">guerrilla communication</a> method which would be employed regularly by Drummond and Cauty throughout their career.

<a href="Bill%20Drummond">Bill Drummond</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Jimmy Cauty</a> started working together early in 1987. They assumed alter egos—Kingboy D and Rockman Rock respectively—and adopted the name "the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu" (the JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group "The Justified Ancients of Mummu" from "<a href="The%20Illuminatus%21%20Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>". "All You Need Is Love" was their debut single.

Initially, the song was released as a limited edition one-sided <a href="white%20label">white label</a> promotional <a href="12-inch%20single">12"</a>, on 9 March 1987, by the JAMs' own label <a href="KLF%20Communications">The Sound Of Mu(sic)</a>. This version included a 15-second sample of <a href="The%20Beatles">the Beatles'</a> "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love">All You Need Is Love</a>", as well as samples of the <a href="MC5">MC5's</a> "<a href="Kick%20Out%20the%20Jams%20%28song%29">Kick Out the Jams</a>" and <a href="Samantha%20Fox">Samantha Fox's</a> "<a href="Touch%20Me%20%28I%20Want%20Your%20Body%29">Touch Me (I Want Your Body)</a>". The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the white label were sent to <a href="DJ">DJ</a>s and the music press. The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (<a href="Bill%20Drummond">Drummond</a> was actually something of a music business veteran, and <a href="Jimmy%20Cauty">Cauty</a> a former member of the much-hyped but unsuccessful band <a href="Brilliant%20%28band%29">Brilliant</a>). "Underground" Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: "The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... 'No, we've not been in bands before, and yes, I suppose we were originally influenced by the <a href="Beastie%20Boys">Beastie Boys</a> to actually get up and do something...' Too true, but these colonials seem a touch wiser, world weary a bit, but not angry...". In the 28 March 1987 edition, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" revealed King Boy D's identity as Bill Drummond.

The JAMs re-edited the single in such a way that—they hoped—"brought [them] inside the "law" but still got up peoples noses", removing all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal. This new version—named "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)"—was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album "<a href="1987%20%28What%20the%20Fuck%20Is%20Going%20On%3F%29">1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)</a>". Indeed, according to Drummond, the recording of "1987" was funded by the sales of "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)".

The central theme of "All You Need Is Love" was the media coverage given to the <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> crisis. The original version opens with a 15-second sample of The Beatles' "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love">All You Need Is Love</a>", followed by <a href="Rob%20Tyner">Rob Tyner's</a> cry of "Kick out the Jams, motherfuckers!" from the MC5's album "<a href="Kick%20Out%20the%20Jams">Kick Out the Jams</a>". A simple beatbox rhythm begins, along with samples of <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a> from a British public information film—entitled "Don't Die of Ignorance"—about the dangers of AIDS. The samples misquote the film: "sexual intercourse—no known cure". Bill Drummond performs a heavily accented <a href="Clydeside">Clydeside</a> <a href="rapping">rap</a>, beginning "We're back again, they never kicked us out, twenty thousand years of 'shout shout shout'", a reference to the fictional JAMs of "The Illuminatus! Trilogy". Later, he raps: "With this killer virus who needs war? Immanentize the eschaton, I said shag shag shag some more!" "<a href="Immanentize%20the%20eschaton">Immanentize the eschaton</a>" is a reference to the opening line of "Illuminatus!", referring to the end of the world, and "shag" is a <a href="British%20slang">British slang</a> word for sexual intercourse.

Between verses, the rhythm is punctuated by samples of former <a href="glamour%20model">glamour model</a> Samantha Fox ("Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body"), as well as a sample "Ancients of Mu Mu" (by The JAMs' associate rapper Chike) which recurred throughout the next ten years' work of Drummond and Cauty. Also heard is a rendition by children of "<a href="Ring%20a%20Ring%20o%27%20Roses">Ring a Ring o' Roses</a>", rhythmic panting, and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality. "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox's sexually provocative "Touch Me" alongside "Ring a Ring O'Roses" ("the nursery rhyme about the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20London">Plague</a>") "highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society's attitude towards death through sex". More succinctly, "NME" said: "'All You Need...' is by "everyone"" (so many samples) "and about "everything"" (and a variety of thematic nuances).

Drummond has said he was inspired by the <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> and scratch he was hearing regularly on <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel's</a> <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> show, but looking back in 1991 he said "If you listen to it now, it sounds nothing like a hip hop record, you know, it sounds a lot more like British <a href="Punk%20rock">punk</a>... [a] punk version of a hip hop record, I suppose."

The original white label release of "All You Need Is Love" was made "single of the week" in "Sounds" magazine, who announced that The JAMs had "produced the first single to capture realistically the musical and social climate of 1987". Calling the result "a seething terror ridden pulp", "Sounds" elaborated: "How have [The JAMs] produced a record more powerful than <a href="Time%20Zone%20%28band%29">Lydon/Bambaataa's</a> "World Destruction" without laying a finger on a synthesiser or guitar? THEFT! By stealing all the various beats, noises and sounds they've wanted, and building it into their own stunning audio collage, [The JAMs] are making a direct assault on the way records are put together."

"Underground" magazine were also enthusiastic: "This month I'm pleased to say, what's really moving is entirely British. The best groove so far this year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it "should" be done, a one-sided, one-track 12 inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a <a href="piss%20take">piss take</a>. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)."

In a July 1987 review of "1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)", "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine recalled that the original release of "All You Need Is Love" "seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness. Here were <a href="Red%20Clydeside">Red Clydeside</a> beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people's recordings, while at the same time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims." This was contrasted with "1987" which the reviewer felt was a "disappointment" with "too few ideas being spread too thin".

The re-release of "All You Need Is Love" rewarded The JAMs with further praise, including "NME" "single of the week", in which <a href="Danny%20Kelly%20%28journalist%29">Danny Kelly</a> thought that "its maverick requisition of the hip-hop <a href="idiom">idiom</a>, its fanatical confrontation of copyright laws overrun by music's new technologies, its central subject matters and its termination with the year's most incisively searching question—'1987: what the f**k's going on?'—combine to make 'All You Need Is Love' a triumph of nowness over mere newness" [sic]. Reviewing "1987" later in the year, the same writer described "All You Need Is Love" as "mighty" but he was unable to hide his disappointment in the album as a whole: "is it the runaway juggernaut hyperbrill monster crack that the outriding 45 threatened? No."

A retrospective piece in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called "All You Need Is Love" a "jagged slice of agit-prop" and "shockingly effective", adding that "[the original] was a club hit (i.e. everybody danced to it though nobody bought it), and after being re-edited to avoid copyright restrictions, it reached number three in the Indie chart".

The artistic attitude of "All You Need Is Love" epitomised that of The JAMs' subsequent recordings: plagiarising popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists' work, and juxtaposing these with each other, adding <a href="beatbox">beatbox</a> rhythms and Drummond's <a href="Scottish%20accent">Scottish-accented</a> raps, poems and narrations. The albums "1987" and "<a href="Who%20Killed%20The%20JAMs%3F">Who Killed The JAMs?</a>", and the singles "All You Need Is Love", "<a href="Whitney%20Joins%20The%20JAMs">Whitney Joins The JAMs</a>" and "<a href="Down%20Town">Down Town</a>" all had small-scale production budgets and little mainstream popularity, yet their novel construction and The JAMs' provocative disregard for copyright gained the duo enduring media attention.

The JAMs' promotional tactics were similarly unconventional, including the use of promotional graffiti, a <a href="guerrilla%20communication">guerrilla communication</a> method employed repeatedly by Drummond and Cauty, beginning around the time of their first releases. Some copies of the re-released single were supplied in a picture sleeve which showed The JAMs' "Shag Shag Shag" graffiti defacing a <a href="billboard">billboard</a> (advertising the "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" newspaper) that depicted police chief <a href="James%20Anderton">James Anderton</a>. Anderton, a self-declared Christian, had courted controversy when he said "I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making… We must ask why homosexuals freely engage in sodomy and other obnoxious practices, knowing the dangers involved" As with much of The JAMs' graffiti, the potency of "Shag Shag Shag" was derived from the context it in which it was placed. Further graffiti followed, "JAMs" and "Shag Shag Shag" slogans defacing billboards and Government-funded AIDS warnings in London. The JAMs also made available "Shag Shag Shag" T-shirts which King Boy D told the "<a href="NME">NME</a>" were "selling like hot cakes". The JAMs later revisited the word "shag" when they named their early career retrospective compilation album "<a href="Shag%20Times">Shag Times</a>".

<a href="The%20KLF%20discography">Drummond and Cauty's output</a> as The JAMs and later <a href="The%20KLF">The KLF</a> extensively referenced "The Illuminatus! Trilogy", and their debut recordings were no exception. The lyrical references in "All You Need Is Love" are complemented by the first of many iconographic and numerical allusions that soon came to characterise the duo's work. Their "pyramid blaster" logo—a <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a> with a <a href="ghetto%20blaster">ghetto blaster</a> suspended in front—appeared for the first time on the re-released "All You Need Is Love". The "pyramid blaster" references the "<a href="All%20Seeing%20I">All Seeing I</a>" icon—an eye suspended before a pyramid—associated with "The Illuminatus! Trilogy". The catalogue numbers of the single (JAMS 23, JAMS 23S, JAMS 23T) also reference "Illuminatus!", in which the <a href="23%20%28numerology%29">number 23</a> is a recurring element. The JAMs actively enshrouded themselves with the mythology of the conspiratorial "Illuminatus!", and by adopting the subversive attitude of the fictional JAMs they quickly developed their own mythology.

"All You Need Is Love" was originally released in the UK as a limited edition one-side promotional 12" on 9 March 1987. The UK re-release of 18 May 1987 consisted of a 7" and a 12" that were also limited editions, along with a widely available 12". The re-release included the tracks "Ivum Naya (Ibo Version)" (a version of "All You Need Is Love" with Chike on lead vocals), and "Rap, Rhyme and Scratch Yourself" (an instrumental version of the song, "a stripped down beatbox track for anybody to feel free to do what they want with" according to King Boy D). The 7" A-side was "All You Need Is Love (Me Ru Con Mix)", a Vietnamese song originally titled "Ca Dao Mẹ", written by <a href="Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20C%C3%B4ng%20S%C6%A1n">Trịnh Công Sơn</a> as sung by Duy Khiem, in which The JAMs "[took] remixing as far as we could". "Me Ru Con" featured on The JAMs' "1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)". The formats and track listings of "All You Need Is Love" are tabulated below:

Battle of Dürenstein

The Battle of Dürenstein (; also known as Dürrenstein, Dürnstein and Diernstein), on 11 November 1805, was an engagement in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>. Dürenstein (modern <a href="D%C3%BCrnstein">Dürnstein</a>) is located in the <a href="Wachau">Wachau</a> valley, on the river <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, upstream from <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Austria. The river makes a crescent-shaped curve between Dürnstein and nearby <a href="Krems%20an%20der%20Donau">Krems an der Donau</a>, and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains.

At Dürenstein a combined force of <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> and <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> troops trapped a <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French</a> division commanded by <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9odore%20Maxime%20Gazan%20de%20la%20Peyri%C3%A8re">Théodore Maxime Gazan</a>. The French division was part of the newly created <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">VIII Corps</a>, the so-called "Corps Mortier", under command of <a href="%C3%89douard%20Mortier">Édouard Mortier</a>. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube. <a href="Mikhail%20Kutuzov">Mikhail Kutuzov</a>, commander of the Coalition force, enticed Mortier to send Gazan's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of <a href="Pierre%20Dupont%20de%20l%27%C3%89tang">Pierre Dupont de l'Étang</a>. The battle extended well into the night, after which both sides claimed victory. The French lost more than a third of their participants, and Gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16 percent—but perhaps the most significant was the death in action of <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20von%20Schmitt">Johann Heinrich von Schmitt</a>, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.

The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulm">capitulation at Ulm</a> and three weeks before the Russo-Austrian defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a>. After Austerlitz, Austria withdrew from the war. The French demanded a high <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a>, and <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II</a> abdicated as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, releasing the <a href="Prince-elector%23Thirty%20Years.27%20War%20to%20Napoleon">German states</a> from their allegiance to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

In a series of conflicts in 1803–15 known as the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, various European powers formed five coalitions against the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>. Like the wars sparked by the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (1789), these further revolutionized the formation, organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to <a href="Lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse">mass conscription</a>. Under the leadership of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, French power rose quickly as the "<a href="Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">Grande Armée</a>" conquered most of Europe, and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">invasion of Russia</a> in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–14 campaigns, resulting in the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</a> in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the <a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a>, his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication and banishment to the Island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> concluded the Napoleonic Wars.

During 1803–06 the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">Third Coalition</a> fought the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> and its <a href="French%20client%20republic">client states</a> (see table at right). Although several <a href="Trafalgar%20Campaign">naval battles</a> determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was decided on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations in the Danube valley: the <a href="Ulm%20Campaign">Ulm campaign</a> in the upper Danube and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Vienna campaign</a>, in the middle Danube valley.

Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805. After hostilities of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a> ended in 1801, <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a>—the emperor's brother—took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan. He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803–04, but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when <a href="Karl%20Mack%20von%20Leiberich">Karl Mack</a>, Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster-General of the Army, implemented his own restructuring. Mack bypassed Charles' methodical approach. Occurring in the field, Mack's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military's readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon's maneuvers in Württemberg, Mack reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II</a>, to enter the conflict against France, despite Charles' own advice to the contrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Francis dismissed Charles from his post as "generalissimo" and appointed his <a href="Francophobia">Francophobic</a> brother-in-law, <a href="Archduke%20Ferdinand%20Karl%20Joseph%20of%20Austria-Este">Archduke Ferdinand</a>, as commander.

The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles, having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack, equally ill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Karl%20Philipp%2C%20Prince%20of%20Schwarzenberg">Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg</a>, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.

The campaign in the upper Danube valley began in October, with several clashes in <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>. Near the Bavarian town of <a href="Battle%20of%20Wertingen">Wertingen</a>, northwest of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, on 8 October the 1st Regiment of dragoons, part of <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Murat</a>'s <a href="Reserve%20Cavalry%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">Reserve Cavalry Corps</a>, and grenadiers of <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Lannes</a>' <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">V Corps</a> surprised an Austrian force half its size. The Austrians were arrayed in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4,000 dragoons and 8,000 grenadiers. Nearly 3,000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded. A day later, at another small town, <a href="G%C3%BCnzburg">Günzburg</a>—immediately south of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river—the French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube and, humiliatingly, chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm.

The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Haslach-Jungingen">Haslach</a>, <a href="Johann%20von%20Klenau">Johann von Klenau</a> arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, the overly confident General of Division <a href="Pierre%20Dupont%20de%20l%27%C3%89tang">Pierre Dupont de l'Étang</a> attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men. The French lost 1,500 men killed and wounded. Aside from taking the <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">Imperial Eagles</a> and <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">guidons</a> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau's force also captured 900 men, 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons.

Klenau's victory was the singular success. On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under <a href="Johann%20Sigismund%20Riesch">Johann Sigismund Riesch</a> headed toward <a href="Battle%20of%20Elchingen">Elchingen</a> to secure the bridge there, and the other under <a href="Franz%20von%20Werneck">Franz von Werneck</a> went north with most of the heavy artillery. Recognizing the opportunity, Marshal <a href="Michel%20Ney">Michel Ney</a> hurried the rest of his <a href="VI%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">VI Corps</a> forward to re-establish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. In a two-pronged attack Ney sent one division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube. This division began the assault at Elchingen. At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against Riesch's position. After clearing Austrian pickets from a bridge, the French attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French, but the Austrian infantry broke and ran. In this engagement alone, the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park, 6,000 (out of 8,000 total participants) dead, wounded or captured and four colors. Reisch's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the Danube.

Napoleon's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. Mack completely misread the French dispositions and scattered his forces; as the French defeated each unit separately, the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulm">Ulm fortifications</a>. Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80,000 men. At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians, an agreement to which they held.

The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna, with the French in close pursuit. A <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> army under Gen. Mikhail Kutuzov also maneuvered away from the French, withdrawing to the east. At the <a href="Ill%20%28Vorarlberg%29">Ill river</a> on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by <a href="Michael%20von%20Kienmayer">Michael von Kienmayer</a>. On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in <a href="Battle%20of%20Amstetten">Amstetten</a>. On 7 November the Russians arrived in <a href="St.%20P%C3%B6lten">St. Pölten</a> and crossed the Danube river the next day. Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the Danube, holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein, near the village <a href="Krems%20an%20der%20Donau">Krems</a>, until the late afternoon.

To the east of Stein, down an old road, lay <a href="Krems%20an%20der%20Donau">Krems</a>, with its small population of a few hundred, at the confluence of the stream of that name and the Danube. To the west of Stein the Danube made a large curve, creating a crescent-shaped floodplain between it and the mountains. At the far western end of the floodplain, where the mountains came down almost to the river's edge, was Dürenstein with its castle, known as "Schloss Dürenstein". The castle had served as a prison for <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I of England</a> in 1193. In 1645–46, during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew. It stands at , on the highest ridge of a mountain fissured with clefts and pinnacles of granite. Because the mountain was sparsely vegetated, it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks. Narrow canyons cut through the mountain, and widen into the plain below. Between Dürenstein and Stein, on the flood plain, lay the <a href="hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a>s of Oberloiben and Unterloiben. Near the hamlets, the Loiben flood plain was at its widest, extending at the most from the base of the Loibenberg mountain to the bank of the river.

The region was known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced <a href="viticulture">viticulture</a> and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended up the sides of the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark "Urgestein", primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.

Napoleon had calculated that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia to defend its political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the "Grande Armée" to create a new <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e%29">VIII Corps</a>. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.

The new VIII Corps, under the overall command of <a href="%C3%89douard%20Mortier">Édouard Mortier</a>, included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry (see <a href="%23Orders%20of%20battle">Order of Battle below</a>). Corps Mortier, as it was known, crossed the Danube at <a href="Linz">Linz</a> and <a href="Passau">Passau</a> in early November 1805 and marched east, on the north bank of the Danube. Operating independently, the corp's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks. Gen. Gazan's division (about 6,000 men) took the lead; Mortier was with them. They were followed by Dupont's division (another 4,000) about one day's march behind. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Dumonceau">Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau</a>'s division (another 4,000), marching another day behind Dupont, brought up the rear. A flotilla of 50 boats acquired at Passau provided communications across the Danube. Before sending Mortier on his mission, Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements, advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders. Napoleon also advised Mortier to secure all crossings of the Danube between Linz and Vienna.

On 9 November Gazan's division reached <a href="Marbach%20an%20der%20Donau">Marbach an der Donau</a> and covered the to Dürenstein by early on the following afternoon. Here it skirmished with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them. Feeling confident, the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein. In Dürenstein itself, Mortier established his command post and directed the construction of a small field hospital. Although the position seemed secure, Mortier ignored Napoleon's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left (north) flank.

This failure was an important factor when Mortier lost his corps' so-called "eyes": after he and Gazan had crossed the Danube, the French dragoons had veered to the northwest, leaving only three squadrons of the 4th Dragoons available for reconnaissance. These had left the division and were operating independently of Gazan's command. Consequently, Mortier and Gazan marched blindly through the narrow canyon west of Dürenstein, not knowing what lay ahead of them. Kutuzov had led the Coalition army across the Danube at <a href="Krems%20an%20der%20Donau">Krems</a>, a short distance past Stein, and destroyed the bridge behind him. His actions deprived the France commanders of a possible route across the Danube, putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat. In this decision Kutuzov abandoned Vienna to the French, who were converging on the Austrian capital from the north, west and southwest, for the security of uniting with reinforcements from <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>. Contrary to Napoleon's expectation, Kutuzov chose a military solution over a political one.

Unknown to either Gazan or Mortier, the Coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24,000 men (mostly Russians and a few Austrians) within a few kilometers of the French position at Dürenstein. In comparison, Gazan's division had only 6,000 men. The Austro-Russian force was a mixture of infantry, "Jägers" (frequently deployed as skirmishers), Russian musketeers and Russian and Austrian cavalry, accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces. The Russian cavalry, units of the greatly feared <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, were well-suited for patrolling the river bank; indeed, on 9 November they had taken 40 French soldiers as prisoners. Furthermore, reinforcements stood in Moravia, less than two weeks' march away. If the main body of the French army crossed the river, they would require time to prepare. Kutuzov, who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian "Generalissimo" <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Suvorov</a>, had overall command and would have ample warning of any large-scale French movement.

After the afternoon's initial skirmishing with the French, Kutuzov held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at <a href="Melk">Melk</a>, at the <a href="Melk%20Abbey">great abbey</a> there. He knew several things. First, he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured. He also knew that Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well ahead of any French reinforcements: Dupont had crossed at Passau and, by 10 November, stood at Marbach, upstream, and Dumonceau was another further behind Dupont. Kutuzov knew the size of the French force—its division strength—and its positions, and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north. He also knew, or had made a good supposition, about Napoleon's orders, so he knew what to offer Mortier and Gazan as bait.

In addition to the Russian generals, the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20von%20Schmitt">Johann Heinrich von Schmitt</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Karl%20Wilhelm%2C%20F%C3%BCrst%20zu%20Hohenlohe">Friedrich Karl Wilhelm, Fürst zu Hohenlohe</a>. Although retired since 1800, Schmitt had been recalled after the Ulm debacle and had come to Kutuzov highly recommended by the Emperor. He was an experienced tactician and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military; he had been <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles'</a> trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles' victories. Upon his recall, Schmitt was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army. The generals also had found among the Austrian force one Capt. Christoph Freiherr von Stiebar (1753–1824), who had knowledge of the local geography.

Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and the other generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to encircle the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander <a href="Mikhail%20Miloradovich">Mikhail Miloradovich</a> would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by <a href="Pyotr%20Bagration">Pyotr Bagration</a>'s corps, and pin the French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by <a href="Dmitry%20Dokhturov">Dmitry Dokhturov</a> (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from the west and the north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> and only a rearguard would be left at Krems.

On the night of 10–11 November a Russian column under Strik's command began its passage through the narrow canyons, intent on arriving at Dürenstein by noon; two more columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, moved in wider semicircles, planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French, who were extended along the river bank. According to the plan, in late morning Strik's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right. This flanking attack, combined with Miloradovich's frontal assault from Stein, would force the French into a vise; encircled, they would have no option but to surrender—or die. To ensure the success of the plan, the second and third columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults. In this way, even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach, they would not escape the vise-like grip of the Coalition army.

Mortier accepted the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In the early morning of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of <a href="Krems%20an%20der%20Donau">Stein</a>. Fighting spread though the villages of <a href="Oberloiben">Oberloiben</a>, <a href="Unterloiben">Unterloiben</a> and the farm at <a href="Rothenhof">Rothenhof</a>. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.

Initially Gazan made rapid progress, but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rearguard of a retreating army. Realizing he had been duped and that Gazan's troops were tiring rapidly, Mortier sent orders to Dupont's division to hurry forward. By mid-morning the French momentum had stalled; Mortier committed most of his remaining forces to driving Miloradovich back, leaving a single battalion—perhaps 300 troops—to cover his northern flank, and sent the rest to attack the Russian right. Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought. His 4,500 French opposed 2,600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river. Miloradovich had no option, for neither Strik's nor Dokhtorov's flanking columns were to be seen.

Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan waited for Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite—12:00 or 14:00—varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.

Earlier in the morning Dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even before the arrival of Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.

Schmitt arrived at dusk, and the action continued well after dark; in mid-November night falls at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action, and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.

The losses were staggering: Gazan lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds. Aside from losing five guns, 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured, bringing the loss of effectives closer to 60 percent; furthermore, he lost the <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">eagles</a> of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28France%29">4th Infantry Regiment (France)</a> and the eagle and <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">guidon</a> of the 4th Dragoons. The Russians lost around 4,000, about 16 percent of their force, and two regimental colors. The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshal Schmitt was killed as the battle concluded, probably by Russian musketry in the confused melee. The vineyards and the villages of Ober- and Unterloiben were destroyed, as was most of Dürenstein and Stein. Krems was heavily damaged; the French plundered the town at least twice, and "barbarously handled" its inhabitants.

Both sides claimed victory. Although losses were fairly equal in terms of numbers—4,000 wounded or dead on each side—the Coalition forces went into battle with 24,000 men while the French started with Gazan's division of about 6,000, which grew close to 8,000 when Dupont's men joined the fighting in the afternoon. Regardless, Gazan's division was nearly destroyed; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division. Clearly for both sides, the fighting was hard. The weather had been cold; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways, and icicles "like chandeliers" hung from the trees.

For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on the north bank of the Danube, awaiting reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20Maria%20Theresa">Military Order of Maria Theresa</a>.

For the French, the survival of the Corps Mortier seemed nothing short of a miracle. The remainder of Gazan's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in Vienna, which the French acquired by deception later in the month. More importantly for them, the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions. Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft. They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems, overturning their boats. Tossed into the icy river, most had drowned. Despite this initial panic, Gazan's column retained its cohesion, and responded well to various difficult demands. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen: when he heard cannon fire, he directed his troops toward it to support the French division. In terms of French staffing, Mortier's failure to guard his flank, especially in the face of Napoleon's direct advice, adversely influenced his relationship with his commander. However, in the immediate weeks ahead, the flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had. In assessing the battle and its aftermath, historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan: "Napoleon, aware of Mortier's danger and his own culpability for it, vented his frustration on Murat, whom he unjustly accused of abandoning Mortier for the empty glory of riding through Vienna." 

After the victory at Austerlitz, Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned Mortier. However disappointed he may have been with Mortier, Napoleon was pleased with Gazan's performance. As recognition of his conduct in what the French called "the immortal Battle of Dürenstein", Gazan received the Officer's Grand Cross of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>.

The loss of Schmitt was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, he was the most experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles'</a> staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Emmendingen</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Schliengen">Schliengen</a>, the sieges at <a href="Siege%20of%20Kehl%20%281796%E2%80%9397%29">Kehl and Hünigen</a>, the battles at <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a>, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at <a href="Battle%20of%20Winterthur%20%281799%29">Winterthur</a> and <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Zurich">Zürich</a>. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> than his eventual replacement, <a href="Franz%20von%20Weyrother">Franz von Weyrother</a>. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hohenlinden">Hohenlinden</a> in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessor of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.

In the broader picture, despite the important <a href="Trafalgar%20Campaign">major naval</a> engagements, the outcome of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a> was determined on the Continent, predominantly in the two major land operations. In the first, the <a href="Ulm%20Campaign">Ulm campaign</a>, the Habsburgs achieved such minor victories as Klenau's at <a href="Battle%20of%20Haslach-Jungingen">Haslach-Jungingen</a> and, after the capitulation at Ulm, isolated portions of the Austrian military evaded capture and joined with their Russian allies; <a href="Michael%20von%20Kienmayer">Michael von Kienmayer</a>'s corps slipped out of the French encirclement and joined Kutuzov's force. A few other small forces refused to capitulate and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the Thuringian forests, to reappear in Bohemia in time for Austerlitz. Sixteen hundred cavalry, including Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Schwarzenberg, broke out of Ulm before its capitulation. <a href="Maximilian%2C%20Count%20of%20Merveldt">Maximilian, Count of Merveldt</a>, led his column back through the mountains into Austria, fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at <a href="Battle%20of%20Steyer">Steyer (Steyr)</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mariazell">Mariazell</a> and a successful skirmish between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of <a href="N%C3%B6rdlingen">Nördlingen</a>. These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French. Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at Austerlitz, the contested victory at Dürenstein and another within days at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sch%C3%B6ngrabern">Schöngrabern</a> were the only bright spots in an otherwise dismal Austrian autumn of campaigning. Ultimately, the Austrians lost an entire army and an officer corps, which could not resume arms against France until formally exchanged. This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as Schmitt out of retirement.

The second determining event, the decisive French victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> over the combined Russian and Austrian armies, forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition. The subsequent <a href="Peace%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29">Peace of Pressburg</a>, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Campo Formio</a> and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lun%C3%A9ville">Lunéville</a>. Furthermore, Austria ceded land to Napoleon's German allies, and paid an <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a> of 40 million <a href="franc">franc</a>s. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine">buffer zone</a> of German states between France and the states of Prussia, Russia, and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> worries about growing French influence in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a> sparked the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a> in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.

Until 1805, Dürenstein was probably best known as the village in which <a href="Third%20Crusade">crusader</a> <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard the Lionheart</a> was held by <a href="Leopold%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold V, Duke of Austria</a>. In 1741, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies, intent on capturing Vienna, by painting drain pipes to look like cannons, and beating on drums, thus suggesting the presence of a large force.

After 1805, the exploits of 40,000 French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the "Stein Tor", the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created an image of the battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer <a href="John%20Outhwaite">John Outhwaite</a>. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.

In 1836, <a href="Jean-Antoine-Sim%C3%A9on%20Fort">Jean-Antoine-Siméon Fort</a>, a <a href="history%20painting">historical</a> painter, created a watercolor of the battle, "Combat de Dürnstein le 11 novembre 1805" ( "Battle of Dürenstein of 11 November 1805"), which is in the Trianon collection at Versailles.

In the Russian novel "<a href="War%20and%20Peace">War and Peace</a>", <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> devoted several pages to the battle, its prelude, and its aftermath, and the delivery of its news to Francis II (Holy Roman Emperor) by <a href="Andrei%20Nikolayevich%20Bolkonsky">Prince Andrew</a>. Between Dürenstein and <a href="Rossatz">Rossatz</a>, at the edge of the Loiben plain, stands the "Little Frenchman" memorial (see image) erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle; it bears the names of Mortier, Gazan, Kutuzov, Schmitt, and others on a copper-engraved plate.

On 6 November, Édouard Adolphe Mortier commanded the following forces:


Total: fifteen battalions, six squadrons, six guns, approximately 12,000 men, not all of which were involved in the fighting.


Total: fifty-eight battalions, sixty-two squadrons, fourteen artillery batteries, approximately 24,000 men and 168 guns.

Muhammad I of Granada

Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Nasr (1195 – 22 January 1273), also known as Ibn al-Aḥmar () and by his epithet al-Ghalib billah ("The Victor by the Grace of God"), was the first ruler of the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Emirate of Granada</a>, the last independent Muslim state on the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, and the founder of its ruling <a href="Nasrid%20dynasty">Nasrid dynasty</a>. He lived during a time when Iberia's Christian kingdoms—especially <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> and <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a>—were <a href="reconquista">expanding</a> at the expense of the Islamic territory in Iberia, called <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>. Muhammad ibn Yusuf took power in his native <a href="Arjona%2C%20Spain">Arjona</a> in 1232 when he rebelled against the "de facto" leader of Al-Andalus, <a href="Ibn%20Hud">Ibn Hud</a>. During this rebellion, he was able to take control of <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a> and <a href="Seville">Seville</a> briefly, before he lost both cities to Ibn Hud. Forced to acknowledge Ibn Hud's <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>, Muhammad was able to retain Arjona and <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain">Jaén</a>. In 1236, he betrayed Ibn Hud by helping <a href="Ferdinand%20III%20of%20Castile">Ferdinand III of Castile</a> take Córdoba. In the years that followed, Muhammad was able to gain control over the southern cities, including <a href="Granada">Granada</a> (1237), <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> (1238) and <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> (1239). In 1244, he lost Arjona to Castile. Two years later, in 1246, he agreed to surrender Jaén and accept Ferdinand's overlordship in exchange for peace.

In the 18 years that followed Muhammad consolidated his domain by maintaining relatively peaceful relations with the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a>; in 1248 he even helped the Christian kingdom take Seville from the Muslims. But in 1264, he turned against Castile and assisted the <a href="Mud%C3%A9jar%20revolt%20of%201264%E2%80%9366">unsuccessful rebellion</a> of Castile's newly conquered Muslim subjects. In 1266 his allies in Málaga, the <a href="Banu%20Ashqilula">Banu Ashqilula</a>, rebelled against the emirate. When these former allies sought assistance from <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X of Castile</a>, Muhammad was able to convince the leader of the Castilian troops, <a href="Nu%C3%B1o%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20de%20Lara%20%28died%201275%29">Nuño González de Lara</a>, to turn against Alfonso. By 1272 Nuño González was actively fighting Castile. The emirate's conflict with Castile and the Banu Ashqilula was still unresolved in 1273 when Muhammad died after falling off his horse. He was succeeded by his son, <a href="Muhammad%20II%20al-Faqih">Muhammad II</a>.

The Emirate of Granada which Muhammad founded, and the Nasrid royal house lasted for several more centuries until it was <a href="Granada%20War">annexed</a> by Castile in 1492. His other legacy was the construction of the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a>, his residence in Granada. His successors would continue to build the palace and fortress complex and reside there, and it has lasted to the present day as the architectural legacy of the emirate.

Muhammad ibn Yusuf was born in 1195 in the town of <a href="Arjona%2C%20Spain">Arjona</a>, then a small frontier Muslim town south of the Guadalquivir, now in Spain's <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">province of Jaén</a>. He came from a humble background and, in the words of the Castilian "<a href="First%20General%20Chronicle">First General Chronicle</a>", initially he had "no other occupation than following the oxen and the plough". His clan was known as the <a href="Banu%20Nasr">Banu Nasr</a> or the Banu al-Ahmar According to later Granadan historian and vizier <a href="Ibn%20al-Khatib">Ibn al-Khatib</a>, the clan was descended from a prominent <a href="sahaba">companion</a> of the Islamic prophet <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> known as <a href="Sa%27d%20ibn%20Ubadah">Sa'd ibn Ubadah</a> of the <a href="Banu%20Khazraj">Banu Khazraj</a> tribe; Sa'd's descendants migrated to Spain and settled in Arjona as farmers. During his early life he became known for his leadership activity on the frontiers and for his <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> image, which he maintained even after becoming ruler.

Muhammad was also known as Ibn al-Ahmar, or by his "<a href="Kunya%20%28Arabic%29">kunya</a>" Abu Abdullah.

The early thirteenth century was a period of great loss for the Muslims of the Iberian Peninsula. The <a href="Almohad%20caliphate">Almohad caliphate</a>, which had dominated <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> or the Muslim Iberia, was split by a dynastic struggle after Caliph <a href="Yusuf%20II%2C%20Almohad%20caliph">Yusuf II</a> died in 1224 without an heir. Al-Andalus <a href="Taifa%23Third%20period%20%2813th%20century%29">broke up</a> into multiple small kingdoms or "<a href="taifa">taifa</a>s". One of the "taifa" leaders was <a href="Ibn%20Hud">Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Hud</a> (d. 1238), who revolted against the Almohads and nominally proclaimed the authority of the <a href="Abbasid%20caliphate">Abbasid caliphate</a> but in practice ruled independently from <a href="Taifa%20of%20Murcia">Murcia</a>. His growing strength made him the "de facto" leader of Al-Andalus, and briefly Muhammad's overlord. Despite his popularity and his success in Al-Andalus, Ibn Hud had suffered defeats against the Christians, including at Alanje in 1230 and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jerez">at Jerez</a> in 1231, followed by the loss of <a href="Badajoz">Badajoz</a> and <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a>.

In the north of the peninsula there were several Christian kingdoms: <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> (in a union with Castile since 1231), <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Navarre</a>, and a union of kingdoms known as the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>. They had been expanding south—taking formerly Muslim-ruled territores—in a process called the "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>" or "the reconquest". All of the kingdoms had sizable Muslim minorities. By the mid-thirteenth century, Castile was the largest kingdom of the peninsula. Its king, <a href="Ferdinand%20III%20of%20Castile">Ferdinand III</a> () took advantage of the addition of León to his realm and of the Muslims' disunity to launch a southward expansion into Muslim territories, eventually conquering <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a> (1236) and <a href="Seville">Seville</a> (1248).

The defeats suffered by Ibn Hud eroded his credibility; rebellions broke out in parts of his domain, including Muhammad's small town of Arjona. On 16 July 1232, a mosque assembly in Arjona declared the town's independence. This proclamation took place on 26 <a href="Ramadan%20%28calendar%20month%29">Ramadan</a> 629 in the Islamic calendar, after the final <a href="Friday%20prayer">Friday prayer</a> of the holy month. The assembly elected Muhammad, who was known for his piety and his martial reputation in previous conflicts against the Christians, as the town's leader. Muhammad also had the support of his clan, the Banu Nasr and an allied Arjonan clan known as the <a href="Banu%20Ashqilula">Banu Ashqilula</a>.

In the same year, Muhammad took Jaén—an important city close to Arjona. With help from Ibn Hud's rivals, the <a href="Banu%20al-Mawl">Banu al-Mawl</a>, Muhammad briefly seized control of the former caliphal seat of Córdoba. He also took Seville in 1234 with help from the Banu al-Bajji family, but he was only able to hold it for one month. Both Córdoba and Seville, dissatisfied with Muhammad's ruling style, returned to Ibn Hud's rule shortly Muhammad's takeover. After these failures, Muhammad once again declared his allegiance to Ibn Hud and kept his rule over a small region containing Arjona, Jaén, <a href="Porcuna">Porcuna</a>, <a href="Guadix">Guadix</a> and <a href="Baeza">Baeza</a>.

Muhammad turned against Ibn Hud again in 1236. He allied himself with Ferdinand and helped the Castilians <a href="Siege%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba%20%281236%29">take Córdoba</a> and end centuries of Muslim rule in the city. In the following years, Muhammad took control of important cities in the south. In May 1237 (Ramadan 634 <a href="Hijri%20calendar">AH</a>), by invitation of the city's notables, he took <a href="Granada%2C%20Spain">Granada</a>, which he then made his capital. He also took <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> in 1238 and Málaga in 1239. He did not take these southern cities by force, but through political maneuvering and the consent of the inhabitants.

Muhammad entered Granada in May 1238 (Ramadan 635). According to Ibn al-Khatib, he entered the city dressed like a <a href="sufi">sufi</a>, in a plain wool cap, coarse clothes and sandals. He took up residence in the "<a href="alcazaba">alcazaba</a>" (castle) built by the <a href="Zirid%20dynasty%23Zirids%20of%20Granada">Zirids</a> in the 11th century. He then inspected an area known as al-Hamra, where there was a small fortress, and laid the foundations there for his future residence and fortress. Soon work began on defensive structures, an irrigation <a href="dam">dam</a>, and a <a href="ditch">dike</a>. The construction would last into the reigns of his successors, and the complex would be known as the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a> and would become the residence of all Nasrid rulers up to the <a href="Granada%20War">surrender of Granada</a> in 1492. He pressured his tax collectors to collect the necessary funds for the construction, going as far as executing Almería's tax-gatherer Abu Muhammad ibn Arus to enforce his demands. He also used money sent by the <a href="Hafsid%20dynasty">Hafsid</a> ruler of Tunis—intended for defense against the Christians—to extend the city's mosque.

By the end of the 1230s, Muhammad had become the most powerful Muslim ruler in Iberia. He controlled the major cities of the south, including Granada, Almería, Málaga and Jaén. In the early 1240s, Muhammad came into conflict with his former allies, the Castilians, who were invading Muslim territories. Contemporary sources disagree about the cause of this hostility: the Christian "<a href="First%20General%20Chronicle">First General Chronicle</a>" blamed it on Muslim raiding, while Muslim historian <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> blamed it on Christian invasions of Muslim territories. In 1242, Muslim forces successfully raided <a href="And%C3%BAjar">Andújar</a> and <a href="Martos">Martos</a> near Jaén. In 1244, Castile besieged and captured Muhammad's hometown of Arjona.

In 1245, Ferdinand III of Castile <a href="Siege%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%281245%E2%80%9346%29">besieged the heavily fortified Jaén</a>. Ferdinand did not want to risk assaulting the city, so his tactic was to cut it off from the rest of the Muslim territory and starve it into submission. Muhammad tried to send supplies to this important city, but these efforts were thwarted by the besiegers. Due to Muhammad's difficulty in defending and relieving Jaén, he agreed to terms with Ferdinand. In exchange for peace, Muhammad surrendered the city and agreed to pay Ferdinand an annual tribute of 150,000 <a href="maraved%C3%AD">maravedí</a>es—an amount that became Ferdinand's most important source of income. This agreement was made in March 1246, seven months into the siege of Jaén. As part of the agreement he was required to kiss Ferdinand's hand to signify his <a href="vassal">vassal</a>age, and promised him "counsel and aid". Castilian sources tended to emphasize this event as an act of <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">feudal submission</a> and considered Muhammad and his successors as vassals of Castile in the feudal sense. On the other hands, Muslim sources avoided mentions of any vassal-lord relation and tended to frame the relationship as between equals with certain obligations. After the agreement, the Castilians entered the city and expelled its Muslim inhabitants.

The peace agreement with Castile largely held for almost twenty years. In 1248, Muhammad demonstrated his commitment to Ferdinand by sending a contingent to help the Castilian <a href="Siege%20of%20Seville">conquest of the Muslim-held Seville</a>. In 1252, Ferdinand died and was succeeded by <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X</a>. In 1254, Muhammad attended a "<a href="Cortes%20Generales">Cortes</a>", or an assembly of Alfonso's vassals, at the royal palace in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo</a>, where he renewed his promise of loyalty and tributes as well as paying homage to Alfonso's newborn daughter <a href="Berengaria%20of%20Castile%2C%20Lady%20of%20Guadalajara">Berengaria</a>. During his reign, Alfonso was more interested in other enterprises—including a series of unsuccessful campaigns in Muslim North Africa—rather than renewing the conflict with Granada. Muhammad met with Alfonso at the latter's court in Seville every year, and paid his annual tributes. Muhammad used the ensuing peace to consolidate his new emirate. Though small in size, the Emirate of Granada was relatively wealthy and densely populated. Its economy was focused on agriculture, especially silk and dried fruit; it traded with Italy and northern Europe. Islamic literature, art and architecture continued to flourish. The mountains and desert that separate the kingdom from Castile provided natural defenses, but its western ports and the northwestern route to Granada were less defensible.

During his rule, Muhammad placed loyal men in castles and cities. His brother Isma'il was governor of Málaga until 1257. Following Isma'il's death in 1257, Muhammad appointed his nephew, Abu Muhammad ibn Ashqilula, as governor of Málaga.

Peace between Granada and Castile lasted until the early 1260s, when various actions by Castile alarmed Muhammad. As part of his crusade against Muslim North Africa, Alfonso built up his military presence in <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> and <a href="El%20Puerto%20de%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa">El Puerto de Santa María</a> close to Granadan territory. Castile <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerez%20%281261%29">conquered</a> the Muslim-held <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a> in 1261 near the Granadan border and installed a garrison there. In 1262, Castile conquered the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Niebla">Kingdom of Niebla</a>, another Muslim enclave in Spain. In May 1262, during a meeting in <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain">Jaén</a>, Alfonso requested that Muhammad hand the port cities of <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a> and <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a> to him. The demand for these strategically important ports was very worrying to Muhammad, and although he verbally agreed he kept delaying the transfer. Further, in 1263 Castile expelled the Muslim inhabitants of <a href="%C3%89cija">Écija</a> and resettled the town with Christians.

In light of these actions, Muhammad was worried that he would become Alfonso's next target. He began talks with <a href="Abu%20Yusuf%20Yaqub%20ibn%20Abd%20Al-Haqq">Abu Yusuf Yaqub</a>, the <a href="Marinid">Marinid</a> Sultan in Morocco, who then sent troops to Granada, numbering between 300 and 3,000 according to different sources. In 1264, Muhammad and 500 knights traveled to the Castilian court at Seville to discuss an extension of the 1246 truce. Alfonso invited them to lodge at the former <a href="Abbadid%20dynasty">Abbadid</a> palace next to the city's mosque. During the night, the Castilians locked and barricaded the area. Muhammad perceived this as a trap, ordered his men to break out and returned to Granada. Alfonso argued that the barricade was to protect the entourage from Christian thieves, but Muhammad was angered, and ordered troops in his border towns to prepare for war. He declared himself vassal of <a href="Muhammad%20I%20al-Mustansir">Muhammad I al-Mustansir</a>, the Hafsid sultan of Tunis.

The peace was broken in either late April or early May 1264. Muhammad attacked Castile, and at the same time Muslims in the territories recently conquered by Castile ("<a href="Mud%C3%A9jar">Mudéjar</a>s") rebelled; partially over Alfonso's forced relocation policy and partially at Muhammad's instigation. Initially, Murcia, Jerez, Utrera, Lebrija, Arcos and Medina Sidonia were taken into Muslim control, but counterattacks by <a href="James%20I%20of%20Aragon">James I of Aragon</a> and Alfonso retook these territories, and Alfonso invaded Granada's territory in 1265. Muhammad soon sued for peace, and the resulting settlement was devastating for the rebels: the Muslims of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> suffered mass expulsions, replaced by Christians.

For Granada, the defeat had mixed consequences. On the one hand, it was soundly defeated, and according to the peace treaty signed at <a href="Alcal%C3%A1%20de%20Benzaide">Alcalá de Benzaide</a> had to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 maravedíes to Castile—much larger than what had been paid before the rebellion. On the other hand, the treaty ensured its survival, and it emerged as the sole independent Muslim state in the peninsula. Muslims who were expelled by Castile immigrated to Granada, bolstering the emirate's population.

The Banu Ashqilula were a clan and—like the Nasrids—were also from Arjona. They had been the Nasrids' most important allies during their rise to power. They supported Muhammad's appointment as leader of Arjona in 1232 and helped with the acquisition of cities like Seville and Granada. Both families intermarried, and Muhammad appointed members of the Banu Ashqilula as governors in his territories. The Banu Ashqilula's center of power was in Málaga, where Muhammad's nephew Abu Muhammad ibn Ashqilula was governor. Their military strength was the backbone of Granada's power.

By 1266, while Granada was still fighting Castile in the Mudéjar revolt, the Banu Ashqilula started a rebellion against Muhammad I. Sources are scarce regarding the beginning of the rebellion and historians disagree about the cause of the rift between the two families. Professor of Hispano-Islamic history <a href="Rachel%20Ari%C3%A9">Rachel Arié</a> suggested that contributing factors may have been the 1257 declaration of Muhammad's sons—Muhammad and Yusuf—as heirs and his 1266 decision to marry one of his granddaughter Fatima to a Nasrid cousin instead of one of the Banu Ashqilula. According to Arié, these decisions alarmed the Banu Ashqilula because Muhammad had previously promised to share power with them and these decisions excluded them from the Nasrid dynasty's inner circle. In contrast, another historian of Islamic Spain, <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Rubiera%20Mata">María Jesús Rubiera Mata</a> rejected these explanations; she argued that the Banu Ashqilula were worried about Muhammad's decision to invite North African forces during the 1264 Revolt of the Mudéjars because the new military power threatened the Banu Ashqilula's position as the strongest military power in the Emirate.

Muhammad besieged Málaga but failed to overpower the Banu Ashqilula military strength. The Banu Ashqilula sought assistance from Alfonso X of Castile, who was happy to support the rebellion to undermine Muhammad's authority. Alfonso sent 1,000 soldiers under <a href="Nu%C3%B1o%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20de%20Lara%20%28died%201275%29">Nuño González de Lara</a> and Muhammad was forced to break off the siege of Málaga. The danger of fighting at multiple fronts contributed to Muhammad's decision to finally seek peace with Alfonso. In the resulting agreement of Alcalá de Benzaide, Muhammad renounced his claims over Jerez and Murcia—territories not under his control—and promised to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 maravedies. In exchange, Alfonso abandoned his alliance with the Banu Ashqilula and acknowledged Muhammad's authority over them.

Alfonso was reluctant to enforce the last point and did not move against the Banu Ashqilula. Muhammad countered by convincing Nuño González, the commander of the Castilian forces sent to support the Banu Ashqilula, to rebel against Alfonso. Nuño González, who had grievances against his king, agreed; in 1272 he and his Castilian noble allies began operations against Castile from Granada. Muhammad had successfully deprived Castile of Nuño González's forces and gained allies in his conflict against the Banu Ashqilula. The Banu Ashqilula agreed to negotiate under the mediation of Al-Tahurti from Morocco. Before these efforts bore fruit, Muhammad suffered fatal injuries after falling from a horse on 22 January 1273 (29 <a href="Jumada%20al-Thani">Jumada al-Thani</a> 671 AH), near the city of Granada during a minor military expedition. He was buried in a cemetery on the Sabika Hill, east of the Alhambra. An <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> was inscribed on his <a href="headstone">headstone</a> and was recorded by Ibn al-Khatib and other historical sources. He was succeeded by his son <a href="Muhammad%20II%20al-Faqih">Muhammad II</a> as he had planned. Later that year, Muhammad II and Alfonso negotiated a truce—albeit short-lived—between Granada and Castile as well as the Banu Ashqilula.

By the time of his death in 1273, Muhammad had already secured the succession for his son, also named Muhammad, known by the epithet <a href="Faqih">al-Faqih</a> (the canon-lawyer). On his deathbed, Muhammad I advised his heir to seek protection from the <a href="Marinid%20dynasty">Marinid dynasty</a> against the Christian kingdoms. The son, now Muhammad II, was already 38 years old and experienced in the matters of state and war. He was able to continue Muhammad I's policies and would rule until his death in 1302.

Muhammad's main legacy was the founding of the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Emirate of Granada</a> under the rule of the <a href="Nasrid%20dynasty">Nasrid dynasty</a>, which on his death was the only independent Muslim state remaining in the Iberian peninsula, and would last for little over two centuries before <a href="Granada%20War">its fall in 1492</a>. The emirate spanned between Tarifa in the west and eastern frontiers beyond Almería, and was around wide from the sea to its northern frontiers.

During his lifetime, the Muslims of al-Andalus suffered severe setbacks, including the loss of the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a> valley, which included the major cities of Córdoba and Seville as well as Muhammad's hometown of Arjona. According to professor of Spanish history <a href="L.%20P.%20Harvey">L. P. Harvey</a>, he "managed to snatch from disaster ... a relatively secure refuge for Islam in the peninsula". His rule was characterized both by his "unheroic" part in the fall of Muslim cities like Seville and Jaén, as well his vigilance and political astuteness which ensured the survival of Granada. He was willing to enter into compromises, including accepting vassalage to Castile, as well as to switch alliances between Christians and Muslims, to preserve the emirate's independence. The "<a href="Encyclopaedia%20of%20Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a>" comments that while his rule did not have any "spectacular victories", he did create a stable regime in Granada and start the construction of the Alhambra, a "lasting memorial to the Nasrids". The Alhambra is today a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20site">World Heritage site</a>.

His religious views appeared to transform during his career. In the beginning, he displayed an outward image of an ascetic religious frontiersman, like a typical <a href="Islamic%20mysticism">Islamic mystic</a>. He maintained this outlook during his early rule in Granada, but as his rule stabilized, he began to embrace the mainstream <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> orthodoxy and enforced the doctrines of the <a href="Maliki">Maliki</a> "<a href="fuqaha">fuqaha</a>". This transformation and his commitment to mainstream Islam brought Granada into line with the rest of the Islamic world, and were continued by his successors.

Ramblin' Wreck

The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> <a href="Ford%20Model%20A%20%281927%29">Model A</a> <a href="Sport%20coupe">Sport coupe</a> that serves as the official mascot of the student body at the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions. Its most noticeable role is leading the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">football team</a> into <a href="Bobby%20Dodd%20Stadium">Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field</a>, a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin' Reck Club.

The first mechanical Wreck was a 1914 <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a> owned by Dean Floyd Field. Until the current Wreck was donated to the school in 1961, most of the early Ramblin' Wrecks were owned by students, faculty or alumni. The modern Wreck has donned a number of different paint jobs and has had several restorations and modifications made to it. These changes were made by various individuals and organizations over the years, including <a href="Bobby%20Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a> and Georgia Tech Alumni Pete George, who worked at the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> <a href="Atlanta%20Assembly">plant</a> in <a href="Hapeville%2C%20Georgia">Hapeville, Georgia</a>. The upkeep of the Wreck has been the sole responsibility of Ramblin' Reck Club and the Wreck driver since 1987.

The Ramblin' Wreck has been the target of several pranks perpetrated by rival schools; the <a href="University%20of%20Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a> once provided the Wreck with an unsolicited new paint job, and the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> has stolen the Wreck on at least two occasions. Several replica or "false" Wrecks are owned by alumni, or are used for display and do not run. The official Ramblin' Wreck is considered the only "true" Wreck, and no backups or replacements exist.

The term "Ramblin' Wreck" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the car that now bears the name has been in existence. The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of Central America. The Wrecks were constructed from whatever the engineers could find—mostly old tractor and automotive parts—and were kept running by the engineers' ingenuity and creativity. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as "Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech."

The first "mechanical mascot" at Georgia Tech was a 1914 <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a> owned by Dean Floyd Field. Field drove the car to and from class every day from 1916 until 1928. Field cared so much for the car that he even nicknamed it "Nellie". The vehicle was distinguished by its metallic black paint job and a large black box fastened to the rear end by a <a href="Horse%20and%20buggy">buggy</a> wheel hoop. The black box's contents were never revealed to the student body and the box became part of the mystique of the Old Ford.

The student body initially nicknamed the vehicle "Floyd's Flivver" but eventually began to call the car the "Ramblin' 'Reck." The first mention of Field's Ford as a "Ramblin' 'Reck" was in 1926 when he performed an overhaul of the car's engine, body, and paint job with the help of the campus machine shop.

Dean Field found a love for travel with his Model T. He took it all the way to California for seminars on mathematics and education. However, in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was going to buy a Model A. Field quelled the rumors with a personal interview in the last issue of the 1927 "<a href="the%20Technique">Technique</a>". By September 1928, Field felt he could not travel as much with the dilapidated Model T. To the dismay of the student body the vehicle was discarded by Dean Field in 1928 and a Model A was purchased. Field's Model A lasted until 1934 in which he bought a <a href="Ford%20Model%20B%20%281932%29">Ford V8</a>. He would drive over in all three cars during his Georgia Tech tenure of 1900–1945.
In memoriam to his retired "<a href="Tin%20Lizzie">Tin Lizzie</a>", Dean Field started "an Old Ford Race" from the intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to the intersection of Hills Street and Prince Avenue in <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens</a>. The race was sponsored by the "Technique", which nicknamed the event the "Flying Flivver Race." The finish line was facilitated by the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> student newspaper "<a href="The%20Red%20and%20Black">The Red and Black</a>". The only rule of the race was that the car had to be a pre-1926 <a href="Straight-4">4-cylinder</a> motor car. The fastest time in the race was achieved by an <a href="Essex%20%28automobile%29">Essex</a> which completed the 79-mile (126 km) race in 1 hour and 26 minutes or 55 mph (88 km/h).

The Tech administration disliked the perilous race and reduced the race to a more peaceful and regulated parade of contraptions known as the <a href="Georgia%20tech%20traditions%23Reck%20Parade">Ramblin' Wreck Parade</a> after races were completed in 1929 and 1930. The Yellow Jacket Club facilitated the first official Ramblin' Wreck parade in 1932. The only break in the parade's continuous operation occurred with the onset of World War II. There were no parades from 1942–1943 and when the parade did continue in 1944, all Wrecks had to be human powered. In 1946, the Ramblin' Wreck Parade was allowed to operate combustion engines again. The rules instituted in the 1946 Wreck Parade still remain as the parade has become the featured event for all Tech homecomings.

Dean of Student Affairs <a href="James%20E.%20Dull">Jim Dull</a> recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a> to own a broken down vehicle.

In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-<a href="World%20War%20II">war</a> Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in <a href="Towers%20Hall%20%28Georgia%20Tech%29">Towers Dormitory</a>. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> pilot.

Johnson had purchased the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore the car as a father-son project while Craig attended the <a href="Georgia%20Military%20Academy">Georgia Military Academy</a>. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson used spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought the <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> dash from a parts dealer in <a href="Caracas">Caracas, Venezuela</a> and used <a href="Convair%20CV-240%23Variants">Convair 440</a> aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended <a href="Florida%20State%20University">Florida State</a> on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.

When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000, but eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.

The Ramblin' Wreck was unveiled September 30, 1961, at Grant Field in front of 43,501 Tech fans, as it led the team onto the field against <a href="Rice%20Owls%20football">Rice University</a>. The team prevailed 24–0 and the Wreck became an instant success within the Tech family.
The Wreck has since led the team onto the field for every home game.

The current color scheme was selected in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach <a href="Bobby%20Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a>. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield on both the driver- and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an <a href="Old%20Gold">old gold</a> paint from a <a href="Lincoln%20%28automobile%29">Lincoln</a> car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold, he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.

The biggest structural change was a support system attached to the car's frame. The support system runs the length of the running boards and allows the increased weight of cheerleaders or Reck Club members standing on the running boards.

From 1973 to 1987, 1947 <a href="industrial%20engineering">IE</a> alum Pete George maintained the Ramblin' Wreck at the <a href="Hapeville%2C%20Georgia">Hapeville</a> Ford Plant. George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors as well as a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech's 1985 centennial celebration. The car was completely disassembled, rebuilt, and repainted by late 1982.

There were a few noticeable changes to the Ramblin' Wreck after the 1982 refurbishment. An aftermarket <a href="Chrome%20plating">chrome</a> stone guard was added to protect the grill, The emblems on the side were removed and replaced by a basic GT decal on the doors. The 1952 Yellow Jackets were moved to the front tire wells. The white horn was chromed over. The old tire cover was a shield with a football helmet wearing yellow jacket. This was replaced with a white generic <a href="naugahyde">naugahyde</a> Ford tire cover. The Old Model A tires and brakes were replaced with <a href="Ford%20Model%20B%20%281932%29">Model B</a> <a href="whitewall%20tire">whitewall tire</a>s and modified brakes.
The Wreck experienced a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained the vehicle for so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.

After Pete George's retirement in 1987, the upkeep of the Wreck fell directly upon the shoulders of the Wreck Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, the Wreck has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages. The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.

After 1994, Reck Club restored the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 that saw the car repainted and the engine rebuilt. Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the <a href="electrical%20generator">electrical generator</a> with a more efficient Nu-Rex <a href="alternator">alternator</a>.

Reck Club coordinated their second major restoration following damage incurred during a highway accident on June 22, 2007, on <a href="Interstate%2075">Interstate 75</a> in <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Georgia">Monroe County</a>, about 60 miles south of <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. Though trailered, the crash caused severe damage to the body and top of the Ramblin' Wreck, while the <a href="Ford%20Expedition">Ford Expedition</a> and trailer in tow were both wrecked. Fourth-year Polymer, Textile, and Fiber Engineering major John Bird was driving, with his younger brother Matt, and recalled for the press:

Bird had stated that both his brother and he got whiplash from the crash, one of Matt's legs was bruised, and "it also could have
been a lot worse."
The Ramblin' Wreck has led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Grant Field almost 300 games. It also makes appearances for other Georgia Tech sports teams: it is often seen before big <a href="basketball">basketball</a> games at <a href="Hank%20McCamish%20Pavilion">Hank McCamish Pavilion</a>, occasionally parked outside of <a href="Russ%20Chandler%20Stadium">Russ Chandler Stadium</a> during warm weekend <a href="baseball">baseball</a> series, and has attended several <a href="softball">softball</a> games a year at the new mid-campus stadium.

A symbol of the Institute's academic and collegiate tradition, the old Model A is often dispatched to special events on campus. It is always present when new buildings are opened or dedicated. On December 5, 2006, the Wreck became the first car to drive across the new <a href="Technology%20Square">Fifth Street Bridge</a>.

Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, known as When the Whistle Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who died during the previous year. The <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20traditions%23The%20Whistle">Georgia Tech Whistle</a> is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A <a href="procession">procession</a> of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.
During Tech Homecoming, the Ramblin' Wreck has several duties. Several days before Homecoming, it acts as a giant gold <a href="starter%20pistol">starter pistol</a> for the <a href="Mini%20500">Mini 500</a> <a href="tricycle">tricycle</a> race. The Wreck's next task is to lead the racers out of the starting line in the <a href="Freshman%20Cake%20Race">Freshman Cake Race</a>. On the day of the Homecoming football game, the Wreck leads the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20traditions%23Reck%20Parade">Ramblin' Wreck Parade</a>, then leads the football team onto the field.

The car is also present at every Freshman Orientation (FASET), <a href="Earth%20Day">Earth Day</a> festival, and other campuswide events.

A ride in the Wreck serves as a gift to many retiring faculty and staff; a ride onto Grant Field is one of the greatest honors Georgia Tech can bestow. <a href="Kim%20King">Kim King</a>, for example, received this honor on October 2, 2004 during halftime of the <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes">Miami</a> game.

There are several lesser known details about the Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive. Specific physical details and the actual person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked. The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers. There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association. This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots.

When a freshman first reaches campus for FASET (orientation), one of the many traditions that they are introduced to is that freshmen cannot touch the Wreck until the completion of their first year. This rule originated in the 1963 edition of the <a href="Rat%20cap">RAT Rules</a>. If a freshman touches the Wreck between <a href="convocation">convocation</a> and the last day of classes in the Spring, they will receive bad luck throughout their college career and GT will be <a href="curse">curse</a>d to lose to UGA in football that year.

The Wreck is distinguished by its old gold body and white soft top. The soft top has a chrome <a href="Landau%20%28automobile%29">support strut</a>, which features a <a href="brass">brass</a> classic Tech T and 1952 <a href="yellow%20jacket">yellow jacket</a>. The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run the length of the vehicle. The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride. The interior upholstery is solid white <a href="Polyvinyl%20chloride">vinyl</a>. The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it. There are two golden <a href="nylon">nylon</a> pennants emblazoned with the words "To Hell With Georgia" and "Give 'Em Hell Tech" fastened to the front bumper.

The driver of the Ramblin' Wreck is an elected position within Ramblin' Reck Club. This position is determined after every football season. The driver manages the car's public appearances and maintenance. There have only been 46 drivers of the Wreck, making the position of Wreck driver one of the most prestigious positions in all of Georgia Tech's student organizations.

The driver gets to add their own personal touch every year to the Wreck. The front <a href="license%20plate">license plate</a> is chosen by the driver every year and the <a href="radiator">radiator</a> cap is replaced yearly, as well. The cap is typically a flying <a href="quail">quail</a> or a <a href="wreath">wreath</a>. After each driver's term, the driver gets to keep the two pennants, too.

Dean Dull initiated a group known as the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He was also the first person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.
Four women have officially driven the Ramblin' Wreck in its history. Lisa Volmar, an <a href="industrial%20engineering">industrial engineering</a> major, was elected the driver in 1984 and she was the first female driver after 23 consecutive years of male-only drivers.

The name can be spelled either "Ramblin Reck" or "Ramblin Wreck". In all spellings, there is no "g" in "Ramblin". The first references to the 1930 Model A (1961) spelled the word "Reck" while the first references to the 1914 Model T owned by Dean Field spelled the word "Reck" (1925). Ramblin' Reck Club has spelled the word "Reck" since their 1945 club charter. The Institute has adopted the spelling Ramblin' Wreck and holds a trademark on the phrase. Reck Club still refers to the Ramblin' Wreck as the Ramblin' Reck while most other agencies refer to it as the Ramblin' Wreck.

In its history, the Wreck has appeared at a number of away games and other events away from the Georgia Tech campus. Many of these trips resulted in damage to the Reck or other interesting anecdotes.

The first away game for the Ramblin' Wreck was the 1961 game against the <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama Crimson Tide</a>. The Wreck was freighted by <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28US%29">Southern Railway</a> to <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>. At the time, Alabama played its home games at <a href="Legion%20Field">Legion Field</a>. Before the game, the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to traverse the slope up to visit Birmingham's <a href="Vulcan%20statue">Vulcan statue</a>. The trip to Birmingham was such a success, a trip to <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a> for Tech's <a href="Gator%20Bowl">Gator Bowl</a> appearance against <a href="Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football">Penn State</a> was organized, as well. These were the first road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career.

In 1963, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee and Ramblin' Reck Club organized another road trip for the Wreck. This trip took the Wreck up to <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a> for a game against the <a href="Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football">Tennessee Volunteers</a>. After Tech won the game, the Wreck was stored overnight in <a href="Neyland%20Stadium">Neyland Stadium</a>. Administrators and Tennessee's Athletic Director <a href="Bob%20Woodruff%20%28American%20football%29">Bob Woodruff</a> promised Georgia Tech Athletics that the Wreck would be safe. They were wrong. Tennessee students broke into the storage area and painted the Wreck orange. They wrote "Go Vols" in the paint and covered the gold wheels with paint, as well. After the incident, Georgia Tech sent a bill to Tennessee's Athletic Department asking for restitution. Woodruff was believed to have aided the students in their efforts after he openly contested the officiating of the football contest.

In 1976, Tech students took the Wreck to Athens for the annual football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car. The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it. The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed <a href="9%20mm%20caliber">9 mm pistol</a>.

The farthest trips the Ramblin' Wreck has ever traveled from Atlanta were the <a href="1970%20Sun%20Bowl">1970 Sun Bowl</a> in <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, and <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, in 1990 for Tech's <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship">NCAA Final Four</a> appearance against <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20UNLV%20Runnin%27%20Rebels%20basketball%20team">UNLV</a>. The Wreck was freighted by van to <a href="Denver%20Coliseum">Denver Coliseum</a>. Along the way, a television crew documented the trip and broadcast the Wreck's expedition during the Final Four promotions.
The last major road trips for the Ramblin' Wreck were to the 2004 Final Four in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, the <a href="2006%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2006 ACC Championship Game</a> in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, and the <a href="2009%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2009 ACC Championship Game</a> in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa's</a> <a href="Raymond%20James%20Stadium">Raymond James Stadium</a>.

On June 15, 2007, the Wreck was involved in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta in a covered car trailer. The trailer failed while carrying the Wreck, in turn causing the truck and trailer to run off the road and into the roadside ditch. The Wreck fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to its side and roof. Despite the severe body damage (in excess of $30,000), the Wreck was repaired for the first game of the 2007 season against the <a href="Samford%20Bulldogs%20football">Samford Bulldogs</a>.

In 1987, the Ramblin' Wreck and Dean Jim Dull were featured on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC-TV</a>'s morning show. Dean Dull shouted into the camera, "I'm Dean of Students Jim Dull and I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech. Good Morning, America!" Dull was on the show because he had won a make-a-wish contest. All he wanted was for the Ramblin' Wreck, gold-clad students, and himself to be on the ABC morning show and ABC granted the wish.

The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured in several newspapers, magazines, and books. The Ramblin' Wreck is portrayed leading the Georgia Tech football team onto the field on the cover of Al Thomy's 1973 work "Ramblin' Wreck – A Story of Georgia Tech Football". Pete George's 1982 refurbishment was featured in the November 1983 edition of the Ford Times. The June 1986 edition of Cars & Parts Magazine featured the Ramblin' Wreck and the raffle for the Centennial Wreck. The December 1991 Car Collector & Car Classics featured the Wreck on the cover after the National Championship season. The December 2007 Bellsouth Real White Pages for Greater Atlanta featured the Ramblin' Wreck with censored flags.

The Ramblin' Wreck has been featured numerous times in Tech's student newspaper, "<a href="The%20Technique">The Technique</a>", and Atlanta's primary newspaper, the "<a href="Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>". The Wreck has also been featured in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. Local newspapers such as the "<a href="Cherokee%20County%2C%20Georgia">Cherokee</a> Times", "<a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta</a> Chronicle", and "<a href="Gwinnett%20County%2C%20Georgia">Gwinnett</a> Daily Post" have also printed articles about the Wreck.

In the week prior to the 2007 home opener, the Ramblin' Wreck was featured on "<a href="ESPN%20First%20Take">ESPN First Take</a>". ESPN showed old clips of the Wreck leading the football team onto the field and discussed the possibility of the Wreck not making the football opener after 45 consecutive years of never missing a game.

The Ramblin' Wreck was featured prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of <a href="Jim%20Cramer">Jim Cramer</a>'s "<a href="Mad%20Money">Mad Money</a>". Cramer exited the Wreck's passenger door to start the show and one of Cramer's trademark soundboards was attached to the front bumper.

On April 16, 2009, a Georgia Tech student riding on the running board of the Ramblin' Wreck fell and suffered severe head injuries hospitalizing the student for four days. Almost a year later, the student filed suit against Georgia Tech and an auto shop responsible for installing handles on the roof of the car. The lawsuit cites the failure of the auto shop's handles as the reason for the fall and claims the University promoted the unsafe use of a vehicle by students. In September 2013, the student injured in the April 2009 accident, won a settlement of $1.36 million from the <a href="Board%20of%20Regents%20of%20the%20University%20System%20of%20Georgia">Georgia Board of Regents</a> and Eco-Clean, Inc.

The <a href="NCAA%20Football%2012">2012 edition of EA Sports' NCAA football video game</a> featured the addition of the Ramblin' Wreck leading Georgia Tech's football team onto the field at all games played in Bobby Dodd Stadium. The Ramblin' Wreck was included in the game alongside many other colleges' pre-game traditions to "deliver the pride and pageantry of game day".

Several vehicles claim "Ramblin' Wreck status." However, only one car is the official Ramblin' Wreck, with no backups or equivalent vehicles.

Michael Woodruff

Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">FRS</a>, <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons">FRCS</a> (3 April 1911 – 10 March 2001) was an English <a href="surgeon">surgeon</a> and scientist principally remembered for his research into <a href="organ%20transplant">organ transplant</a>ation. Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a>, but was soon captured by <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> forces and imprisoned in the <a href="Changi%20Prison">Changi Prison Camp</a>. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s from agricultural wastes to prevent <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> among his fellow <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">POWs</a>.

At the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon, mixing <a href="Clinician">clinical</a> work and <a href="Medical%20research">research</a>. Woodruff principally studied <a href="transplant%20rejection">transplant rejection</a> and <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a>. His work in these areas of transplantation biology led Woodruff to perform the first <a href="kidney%20transplant">kidney transplant</a> in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> in 1968 and made a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in 1969. Although retiring from surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organizations.

Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in <a href="Mill%20Hill">Mill Hill</a>, London, England. In 1913, his father, <a href="Harold%20Addison%20Woodruff">Harold Woodruff</a>, a professor of <a href="veterinary%20medicine">veterinary medicine</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Veterinary%20College">Royal Veterinary College</a> in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became an officer in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Veterinary%20Corps">Australian Army Veterinary Corps</a> and was sent to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

The remainder of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in <a href="Finchley">Finchley</a>. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a <a href="staphylococcal%20septicaemia">staphylococcal septicaemia</a>. The two then spent a short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.

In 1919, Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first marriage. The two boys did their early schooling at <a href="Trinity%20Grammar%20School%20%28Victoria%29">Trinity Grammar School</a> in Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a>. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Taunton">Queen's College</a> in <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a>, Somerset on the south coast of England. The headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as "colonials" who were "backward" and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than appropriate. Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private Methodist <a href="Wesley%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Wesley College</a>, where he enjoyed mathematics and <a href="rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a>.

He won a government scholarship to the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> and <a href="Queen%27s%20College%20%28University%20of%20Melbourne%29">Queen's College</a>, a university residential college. Woodruff studied <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> and <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist <a href="Harrie%20Massey">Harrie Massey</a>, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. He decided to take up medical studies at the end of his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.

After graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor <a href="Frederic%20Wood%20Jones">Frederic Wood Jones</a>. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Surgery">MBBS</a> with honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied <a href="internal%20medicine">internal medicine</a> for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the <a href="Royal%20Melbourne%20Hospital">Royal Melbourne Hospital</a>. Woodruff then started his surgical training.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Woodruff joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a>. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his <a href="Master%20of%20Surgery">Master of Surgery</a> Degree in 1941. At that time, he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> as a <a href="captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest. However, after the <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.

After being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the <a href="Changi%20Prison">Changi Prison Camp</a>. In the camp, Woodruff realized that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from <a href="vitamin">vitamin deficiencies</a> due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, <a href="soya%20bean">soya bean</a>s, <a href="rice%20polishing">rice polishing</a>s, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20%28UK%29">Medical Research Council</a> titled "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps". Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that <a href="skin%20allograft">skin allograft</a>s were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.

While stationed at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical anæsthetics severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used <a href="Hypnosurgery">hypnotism as the sole means of anæsthesia</a> for a wide range of dental and surgical procedures.

At the conclusion of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to <a href="Albert%20Coates%20%28surgeon%29">Albert Coates</a>. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the rest of their lives.

Soon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to take the second half of the <a href="Fellowship%20of%20the%20Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons">FRCS</a> Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no guarantee of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the <a href="University%20of%20Sheffield">University of Sheffield</a>, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel <a href="Julian%20Taylor%20FRCS">Julian Taylor</a>, had been with him at Changi.

After passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, he had planned to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the <a href="pathology">pathology</a> laboratory where he studied <a href="transplant%20rejection">transplant rejection</a>, a process in which the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> <a href="allograft">allograft</a>s to the <a href="anterior%20chamber">anterior chamber</a> of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet <a href="Peter%20Medawar">Peter Medawar</a>, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed <a href="organ%20transplant">transplantation</a> and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the <a href="Royal%20Melbourne%20Hospital">Royal Melbourne Hospital</a>.

In 1948, shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne, Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> where he was given a post as a senior lecturer, having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand. At Aberdeen, Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson, and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services. He took advantage of this access and his wife's skills as a lab assistant to investigate "<a href="in%20utero">in utero</a>" grafts (tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the <a href="womb">womb</a>). At the time, the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given "in utero" grafts, he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection. Woodruff's experiments with <a href="brown%20rat">rats</a>, however, produced negative results. Woodruff also commenced work on <a href="antilymphocyte%20serum">antilymphocyte serum</a> for <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a>, with little initial success.

While in Aberdeen, Woodruff also visited the United States on a <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met many of the leading American surgeons, an experience that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff experimented with the effects of <a href="cortisone">cortisone</a> and the impact of blood <a href="antigen">antigen</a> on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange <a href="skin%20grafting">skin grafts</a>. When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors. In 1951 Woodruff was awarded a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture "The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application".

In 1953, Woodruff moved to <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> to take up a position as the Chair of Surgery at the <a href="University%20of%20Otago%20Dunedin%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine</a>, New Zealand's only <a href="medical%20school">medical school</a> at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and <a href="St%20Andrews%20University">St Andrews University</a> in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of <a href="white%20blood%20cells">white blood cells</a> to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for <a href="burn%20%28injury%29">burn</a> treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (<a href="graft%20versus%20host%20disease">graft versus host disease</a>). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.

In 1957, Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, <a href="Donald%20Michie">Donald Michie</a> and <a href="James%20Griffiths%20Howard">James Howard</a>. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20%28UK%29">Medical Research Council</a>.

The research group's principal investigations concerned <a href="immunological%20tolerance">immunological tolerance</a> (the body's acceptance of tissues, as opposed to rejection), <a href="autoimmune%20haemolytic%20anaemia">autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</a> (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a <a href="vascular%20surgery">vascular surgery</a> program and worked with the use of <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a> as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in <a href="kidney%20transplantation">kidney transplantation</a>.

Most notably, he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK, at the <a href="Royal%20Infirmary%20of%20Edinburgh">Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh</a>. Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an <a href="Twin%23Monozygotic%20twins">identical twin</a> to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published "The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs", a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 <a href="Lister%20Medal">Lister Medal</a> for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a>, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.

The success of Woodruff's clinical transplant program was recognised and enhanced by funding from the <a href="Nuffield%20Foundation">Nuffield Foundation</a> to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a> struck the transplant unit, resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.

Woodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof <a href="Geoffrey%20Duncan%20Chisholm">Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm</a>, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent the next ten years there, engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on <a href="tumor%20immunology">tumor immunology</a> using <a href="Corynebacterium%20parva">Corynebacterium parva</a>. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.

Woodruff's contributions to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised a method of implanting a transplanted <a href="ureter">ureter</a> in the <a href="Urinary%20bladder">bladder</a> during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's contributions to the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with <a href="Anti-lymphocyte%20globulin">anti-lymphocyte serum</a> has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.

These important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a>. The next year, 1969, Woodruff was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff honorary membership, including the <a href="American%20College%20of%20Surgeons">American College of Surgeons</a>, the American Surgical Association, and the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians%20of%20Edinburgh">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a>. Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as Vice-President of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">WHO</a> advisor and as a <a href="visiting%20professor">visiting professor</a> at a number of universities.

Despite his profound influence on transplantation and what <a href="Peter%20Morris%20%28surgeon%29">Peter Morris</a> called "a commanding presence in any gathering", Woodruff was not known for his ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and had a tendency to mumble. Nevertheless, Morris said that Woodruff has "a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour". Morris concluded that "What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous."

Woodruff's impact is also apparent in his large volume of publications. In addition to authoring over two hundred scholarly papers, Woodruff wrote seven books during his career, covering numerous aspects of medicine and surgery.

The Woodruffs had two sons, followed by a daughter. Their first son completed a medical degree at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> and became an ophthalmologist. The two younger children both did their tertiary education at Sheffield University. The second son became a <a href="civil%20engineer">civil engineer</a> and the daughter completed a science degree in <a href="botany">botany</a>.

Woodruff and his wife were avid tennis players and had a court in their home in Edinburgh. After moving to Edinburgh, Woodruff took up sailing with the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and went on to compete in some races. He owned a boat and was known to go sailing on it in the Mediterranean each summer with his wife. During his student years, Woodruff was a keen rower and <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> player.

Woodruff was a lover of classical music, and after taking up the organ at university and learning from A. E Floyd, the organist of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, he became the college organist at Queen’s College in Melbourne; he later learned to play the piano. In his spare time, Woodruff continued to pursue his love of <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a>, especially <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. He periodically attempted to prove <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>, but failed.
