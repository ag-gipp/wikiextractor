Wendell Willkie

Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican</a> nominee for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a>. Willkie appealed to many <a href="1940%20Republican%20National%20Convention">convention</a> delegates as the Republican field's only <a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist</a>: although the U.S. <a href="Neutrality%20Acts%20of%201930s">remained neutral</a> prior to <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, he favored greater U.S. involvement in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to support Britain and other <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a>. His <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> opponent, incumbent President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 election</a> with about 55% of the popular vote and took the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral college</a> vote by a wide margin.

Willkie was born in Elwood, Indiana, in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">World War I</a> but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>, where he was initially employed by <a href="Firestone%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Firestone</a>, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron Bar Association. Much of his work was representing <a href="electric%20utility">electric utilities</a>, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for <a href="Southern%20Company">Commonwealth & Southern Corporation</a> (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem.

A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201940">1940 presidential primaries</a>, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters—many youthful—enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces advanced <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">through western Europe</a> in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a>. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States%23World%20War%20II">peacetime draft</a>. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states.

After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalist</a> causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.

Lewis Wendell Willkie was born in <a href="Elwood%2C%20Indiana">Elwood, Indiana</a>, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother being one of the first women admitted to the Indiana bar. His father was born in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and his mother was born in Indiana, to <a href="German%20people">German parents</a>; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful <a href="German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349">1848 revolutions in Germany</a>. The Trisches initially settled in <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a> but, as they were <a href="Abolitionism">abolitionists</a>, moved to Indiana after the territory was <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">opened to slavery</a> in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.

Although given the first name Lewis, Willkie was known from childhood by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, who had come to Elwood during <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">his campaign</a>. The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan did not, defeated by former <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.

By the time Willkie reached age 14 and enrolled in Elwood High School, his parents were concerned about a lack of discipline and a slight stoop, and they sent him to <a href="Culver%20Military%20Academy">Culver Military Academy</a> for a summer in an attempt to correct both. Willkie began to shine as a student in high school, inspired by his English teacher; one classmate said that Philip "Pat" Bing "fixed that boy up. He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town." Faced with a set of athletic brothers—<a href="Edward%20Willkie">Edward</a> became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers. He was <a href="class%20president">class president</a> his final year, and president of the most prominent fraternity, but resigned from the latter when a sorority <a href="blackballing">blackballed</a> his girlfriend, Gwyneth Harry, as the daughter of immigrants.

During Willkie's summer vacations from high school, he worked, often far from home. In 1909, aged 17, his journey took him from <a href="Aberdeen%2C%20South%20Dakota">Aberdeen, South Dakota</a>, where he rose from dishwasher to co-owner of a <a href="flophouse">flophouse</a>, to <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, where he was fired after losing control of the horses drawing a tourist <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>. Back in Elwood, Herman Willkie was representing striking workers at the local <a href="tinning">tin plate factory</a>, and in August journeyed with Wendell to Chicago in an attempt to get liberal attorney <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> to take over the representation. They found Darrow willing, but at too high a price for the union to meet; Darrow told Wendell Willkie, "there is nothing unethical in being adequately compensated for advocating a cause in which you deeply believe."

After graduation from Elwood High in January 1910, Willkie enrolled at <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a> in <a href="Bloomington%2C%20Indiana">Bloomington</a>. There, he became a student rebel, <a href="chewing%20tobacco">chewing tobacco</a>, reading <a href="Karl%20Marx">Marx</a>, and petitioning the faculty to add a course on <a href="socialism">socialism</a> to the curriculum. He also involved himself in campus politics, successfully managing the campaign of future Indiana governor <a href="Paul%20McNutt">Paul McNutt</a> for student office, but when Willkie ran himself, he was defeated. He graduated in June 1913, and to earn money for law school, taught high school history in <a href="Coffeyville%2C%20Kansas">Coffeyville, Kansas</a>, coaching debaters and several sports teams. In November 1914, he left his job there for one as a <a href="laboratory">lab</a> assistant in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> arranged by his brother Fred. Wendell Willkie's commitment to social justice was deepened by the sight of workers suffering abuse there.

Willkie enrolled at <a href="Indiana%20University%20Maurer%20School%20of%20Law">Indiana School of Law</a> in late 1915. He was a top student, and graduated with high honors in 1916. At the <a href="Graduation">commencement</a> ceremony, with the <a href="Indiana%20Supreme%20Court">state supreme court</a> present, he gave a provocative speech criticizing his school. The faculty withheld his degree, but granted it after two days of intense debate. Willkie joined his parents' law firm, but volunteered for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> on April 2, 1917, the day President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> asked Congress for a <a href="1917%20United%20States%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany">declaration of war against Germany</a>. An army clerk transposed his first two names; with Willkie unwilling to invest the time to have the bureaucracy correct it, he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Willkie was sent for artillery training, meaning he did not embark for France until September 1918. In January of that year, he married Edith Wilk, a librarian from <a href="Rushville%2C%20Indiana">Rushville, Indiana</a>; the couple had one son, <a href="Philip%20Willkie">Philip</a>. The war ended before Willkie reached the front, and he spent his time defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders. He was recommended for promotion to captain, but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through.

Discharged from the army, Willkie returned to Elwood. He considered a run for Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he would be unlikely to keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the <a href="Firestone%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Firestone Tire and Rubber Company</a> in <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a> as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from <a href="Harvey%20Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a> to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.

Willkie became active in the Akron Democratic Party, becoming prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the Democratic presidential nominee, Ohio Governor <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a>, when he came to town during the 1920 campaign. He was a delegate to the <a href="1924%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1924 Democratic National Convention</a>, and supported New York Governor <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a> through the record 103 ballots, when the nomination fell to former West Virginia congressman <a href="John%20W.%20Davis">John W. Davis</a>. More important to Willkie, though, was a fight against the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party, but he and other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the <a href="party%20platform">party platform</a> condemning the Klan. He also backed a proposed plank in support of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> that ultimately failed. In 1925, Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board.

After leaving Firestone in 1920, Willkie joined leading Akron law firm Mather & Nesbitt, which represented several local <a href="public%20utility">public utilities</a>. Although he quickly gained a reputation as a leading trial lawyer, he was especially noted for presenting utility cases before the <a href="Ohio%20Public%20Utilities%20Commission">Ohio Public Utilities Commission</a>. In 1925, he became president of the <a href="Akron%20Bar%20Association">Akron Bar Association</a>. One of Willkie's clients, Ohio Power & Light, was owned by New York-based <a href="Southern%20Company">Commonwealth & Southern Corporation</a> (C&S), whose chairman, B.C. Cobb, noticed him. Cobb wrote to the senior partner of Willkie's firm, "I think he is a comer and we should keep an eye on him." In 1929, Cobb offered Willkie a salary of $36,000 to be corporate counsel to C&S, a job which would involve a move to New York, and Willkie accepted.

Wendell and Edith Willkie moved to New York in October 1929, only weeks before the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>, and found an apartment overlooking <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway theatre</a>, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie and his wife had little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met <a href="Irita%20Van%20Doren">Irita Van Doren</a>, the book review editor of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.

At C&S, Willkie rose rapidly under the eye of Cobb, impressing his superiors. Much of his work was outside New York City; Willkie was brought in to help try important cases or aid in the preparation of major <a href="legal%20brief">legal brief</a>s. Cobb, a pioneer in the electricity transmission business, had presided over the 1929 merger of 165 utilities that made C&S the largest electric utility holding company in the country. He promoted Willkie over 50 junior executives, designating the younger man as his successor. In January 1933, Willkie became president of C&S.

Willkie maintained his interest in politics, and was a delegate to the <a href="1932%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1932 Democratic National Convention</a>. Since the incumbent Republican president, <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, was widely blamed for <a href="the%20Depression">the Depression</a> that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would have a good chance of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="John%20Nance%20Garner">John Nance Garner</a>, and former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Newton%20D.%20Baker">Newton D. Baker</a> sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.

Soon after taking office, President Roosevelt proposed legislation creating the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA), a government agency with far-reaching influence that promised to bring <a href="flood%20control">flood control</a> and cheap electricity to the impoverished <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a>. However, the TVA would compete with existing private power companies in the area, including C&S subsidiaries. Willkie appeared before the House Military Affairs Committee on April 14, 1933. He approved of the ideas for development of the Tennessee Valley, but felt that the government role should be limited to selling power generated by dams. Although the House of Representatives passed a bill limiting the TVA's powers, the Senate took the opposite stance, and the latter position prevailed.
Negotiations took place through the remainder of 1933 for C&S to sell assets, including a transmission line, to allow the TVA to distribute energy to retail customers, leading to an agreement on January 4, 1934. TVA head <a href="David%20Lilienthal">David Lilienthal</a> was impressed by Willkie, who left him "somewhat overwhelmed" and "pretty badly scared". C&S agreed to sell some of its properties in part of the Tennessee Valley, and the government agreed that the TVA would not compete with C&S in many areas. In October 1934, holders of securities issued by a C&S subsidiary filed suit to block the transfer. Willkie angrily denied that he had prompted the lawsuit, though plaintiffs' counsel proved later to have been paid by the <a href="Edison%20Electric%20Institute">Edison Electric Institute</a>, of which Willkie was a board member. Willkie warned that New York capital might avoid Tennessee if the TVA experiment continued, and when Roosevelt gave a speech in praise of the agency, issued a statement rebutting him. By 1934, Willkie had become the spokesman for the private electric power industry.

Amid this tension, Willkie and Roosevelt met for the first time, at the White House on December 13, 1934. The meeting was outwardly cordial, but each man told his own version of what occurred: the president boasted of having outtalked Willkie, while the executive sent a soon-to-be-famous telegram to his wife: "" Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up, stated so in his 1935 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20address">State of the Union address</a> and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent. In the meantime, the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new <a href="Norris%20Dam">Norris Dam</a> could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow, and the company ran "spite lines" that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non-compete agreement over broad areas.
Through 1935, as the breakup legislation wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly passed a bill for the breakup, Willkie made a series of speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the <a href="telephone%20book">telephone book</a>, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass <a href="Public%20Utility%20Holding%20Company%20Act%20of%201935">a bill</a> requiring the breakup to take place within three years.

In September 1936, Roosevelt and Willkie met again at the White House, and a truce followed as both sides waited to see if Roosevelt would be re-elected over the Republican, Kansas Governor <a href="Alf%20Landon">Alf Landon</a>. Willkie, who voted for Landon, expected a narrow victory for the Republican, but Roosevelt won an overwhelming landslide as Landon won only Maine and Vermont. In December, a federal district court judge granted the C&S companies an injunction against the TVA, and negotiations broke off by Roosevelt's order as the litigation continued. Willkie took his case to the people, writing columns for major publications, and proposing terms for an agreement that "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described as "sensible and realistic". He received favorable press, and many invitations to speak.

The January 1938 Supreme Court ruling in "Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes", resolving the 1934 case, and the lifting of the injunction by an appeals court, sent the parties back to the negotiating table. Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. "For several years now, we have been listening to a bedtime story, telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue." "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" dubbed Willkie "the man who talked back".

Willkie and Lilienthal negotiated for a year, with Willkie wanting $88 million for C&S's properties in and around the Tennessee Valley, and the TVA offering $55 million. After a final, January 1939, legal defeat for C&S in the Supreme Court, the pace of the talks quickened, and on February 1, 1939, C&S sold the assets to the TVA for $78.6 million. <a href="Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> chairman <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> deemed Willkie to have outsmarted Lilienthal. Though defeated in the courts, Willkie had gained national stature for driving a hard bargain for his shareholders, and was seen by some as a potential presidential candidate in 1940.

The <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 presidential campaign</a> was conducted against the backdrop of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Although the United States remained neutral, the nation—and especially the Republican Party—was deeply divided between <a href="isolationism">isolationists</a>, who felt the nation should avoid any steps that could lead America into the war, and <a href="Interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionists</a>, who felt that America's survival depended upon helping the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> defeat <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. The three leading candidates for the 1940 Republican nomination were all isolationists to varying degrees: Senators <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a> of Ohio and <a href="Arthur%20Vandenberg">Arthur Vandenberg</a> of Michigan, and <a href="Thomas%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>, the young (38), "gangbusting" Manhattan <a href="District%20Attorney">District Attorney</a>. Roosevelt's popularity had declined since the 1936 landslide, but many still hoped he would run for an unprecedented third term. He had long contemplated one, but made no announcement. Roosevelt's decision-making on this point is uncertain: as late as April 1940, he may have been thinking of retirement. If he stepped aside, possible candidates included Vice President Garner, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Cordell%20Hull">Cordell Hull</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Farley">James A. Farley</a>.
On the assumption Roosevelt would not seek a third term, Willkie had been spoken of as a possible Democratic presidential candidate as early as 1937. He raised his stock considerably when on January 3, 1938, he debated <a href="Assistant%20Attorney%20General">Assistant Attorney General</a> <a href="Robert%20H.%20Jackson">Robert H. Jackson</a> on the radio show, "Town Meeting of the Air". With the topic of the debate being the cooperation between the public and private sectors, Willkie came across as a businessman with a heart, while Jackson appeared dull. A stream of positive press mentions for Willkie continued through 1938 and into 1939, culminating with a favorable cover story in <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> in July 1939. Willkie was initially dismissive of the many letters he received urging him to run for president, but soon changed his mind. Van Doren thought Willkie could be president, and worked to persuade her contacts. After hosting the Willkies for a weekend, <a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">"Fortune" magazine</a> managing editor <a href="Russell%20Davenport">Russell Davenport</a> became convinced Wendell Willkie had presidential timber; he devoted the magazine's April 1940 issue to Willkie, and later served as his campaign manager. In that issue, Willkie wrote an article, "We The People: A Foundation for a Political Platform for Recovery," urging both major parties to omit anti-business policies from their party platforms, protect individual rights, and oppose foreign aggression while supporting world trade. This piece won him applause and supporters from the press.

Willkie never had any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term, and that his route to the White House would have to be through the Republican Party. In late 1939 he changed his registration from Democratic to Republican, and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti-business. He had voted for Landon in 1936, he said, and he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated. As he later characterized it, "I did not leave my party. My party left me."

The start of the war in September 1939 alarmed many Americans, but the majority thought the U.S. should not get involved. Willkie spoke often about the threat to America and the need to aid Britain and other Allies. Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war "transformed Willkie from a big-business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom. And it gave his candidacy new purpose." Despite the chatter about Willkie, there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination. <a href="Kenneth%20F.%20Simpson">Kenneth F. Simpson</a>, <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>man from New York, initially thought the idea of a Willkie run to be silly. Indiana Senator <a href="James%20Watson">James Watson</a> stated that he did not mind if "the town whore" joined the church, but she should not lead the choir the first week.
Willkie did not enter the Republican primaries, placing his hope in a deadlocked convention. His campaign was composed mostly of political amateurs. New York lawyer Orem Root, Jr. (grandnephew of former Secretary of State <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a>) formed a network of local Willkie Clubs, which attracted a large membership among Republicans discontented with their leadership and seeking a new figure who might beat Roosevelt. He especially appealed to liberal, <a href="Eastern%20Establishment">Eastern Establishment</a> Republicans who saw none of the declared candidates to their liking. His rumpled suits, country-style haircut, and Indiana <a href="twang">twang</a> were reminiscent of ordinary midwesterners, which led to some derision as the efforts to nominate him became more obvious. Interior Secretary <a href="Harold%20L.%20Ickes">Harold L. Ickes</a> mocked Willkie as "a simple, barefoot Wall Street lawyer". <a href="Alice%20Roosevelt%20Longworth">Alice Roosevelt Longworth</a> stated that the Willkie campaign came "from the <a href="grass%20roots">grass roots</a> of ten thousand country clubs".

His failure to enter primaries did not greatly disadvantage Willkie because most were "beauty contests" serving only to show voter preferences and not to elect delegates. The primaries were governed by a complex set of unwritten rules about who would enter which primary and Taft ran only in his native Ohio, where Dewey did not enter his name. Most delegates pledged to support a candidate were not strongly committed: what was important to most Republicans was to field a nominee who could beat Roosevelt. The run-up to the June convention in Philadelphia coincided with Hitler's advance in <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>, and delegates had second thoughts about running an isolationist, let alone a young one without national experience such as Dewey. Willkie, who had spoken out against isolationism, and who was a successful executive, was an attractive possibility. Willkie made speeches widely, including in a tour of <a href="New%20England">New England</a> that paid off with promises of support, though delegates might first support a <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidate for a ballot or two. Important converts to Willkie's cause included Minnesota Governor <a href="Harold%20Stassen">Harold Stassen</a> and Massachusetts Governor <a href="Leverett%20Saltonstall">Leverett Saltonstall</a>. The move to Willkie was reflected in polls; he went from 3 to 29 percent in the seven weeks before the convention, while Dewey, the frontrunner, fell from 67 to 47 percent.

The <a href="1940%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1940 Republican National Convention</a> opened at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention%20Hall%20and%20Civic%20Center">Philadelphia Civic Center</a> on June 24, 1940. As the delegates assembled, they discussed the war, the candidates, and Roosevelt's appointment of two Republican interventionists to his cabinet four days before the convention. <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, Secretary of War under <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">President Taft</a> and Secretary of State under Hoover, was restored to the War position, and Landon's 1936 running mate, <a href="Frank%20Knox">Frank Knox</a>, was appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Secretary</a>. The cabinet appointments divided the Republicans, who accused Roosevelt of dirty politics.
Willkie arrived by train in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on June 22, two days before the convention, and immediately attracted attention by walking from <a href="30th%20Street%20Station">30th Street Station</a> to his hotel, answering questions from reporters and anyone else who could get close enough to be heard. Dewey, Vandenberg and Taft had large public headquarters, but Willkie's campaign was run from clandestine rooms at the <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Hotel">Benjamin Franklin Hotel</a>. Root's Willkie Clubs and other supporters bombarded the delegates with telegrams urging support for their candidate, to the annoyance of some. Key convention officials were Willkie supporters; these included <a href="House%20Minority%20Leader">House Minority Leader</a> <a href="Joseph%20William%20Martin%2C%20Jr.">Joe Martin</a>, Massachusetts' favorite son and permanent chairman of the convention. When the head of the Committee on Arrangements, Ralph Williams (deemed likely to support Taft) died just before the convention, he was succeeded by the vice chairman, Sam Pryor, a firm Willkie backer. This placed a Willkie supporter in charge of tickets for the public galleries.

The opening night of the convention saw the <a href="keynote%20speech">keynote speech</a> by Governor Stassen; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie and became one of the candidate's floor managers. The second night featured a speech by the only living former president, Herbert Hoover, who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination. His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system. In the meantime, the Dewey campaign, faced with the German announcement that with France taken, Hitler's forces would sail on Britain, did its best to stem the flow of delegates to Willkie. Negotiations among Dewey, Taft, and Vandenberg came to nothing because none would accept less than the presidential nomination. A blaze of publicity followed Willkie wherever he went, as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters, including the entire Connecticut delegation. A strong minority of African Americans still supported the Republicans, and Willkie met with a group of them, urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941.

Indiana Congressman <a href="Charles%20Halleck">Charles Halleck</a> gave the nominating speech for Willkie on the evening of June 26, arguing that Willkie's recent conversion to the Republican Party was no reason not to nominate him, "is the Republican Party a closed corporation? Do you have to be born into it?" When Halleck mentioned Willkie's name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies, who thunderously chanted, "We want Willkie!". Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of <a href="standing%20room">standing room</a> passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.

Dewey had predicted he would have 400 of the 501 votes needed to be nominated on the first ballot and he kept nothing in reserve so that he might show momentum in future ballots. When delegates first balloted on the afternoon of June 27, he had only 360 to 189 for Taft, 105 for Willkie, and 76 for Vandenberg. On the second ballot, Dewey began to slip, falling to 338 to Taft's 203 and 171 for Willkie. The losses greatly damaged Dewey's campaign, because other than the trivial losses suffered in the early rounds of balloting by <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> in 1920, no Republican candidate had ever lost support from the previous ballot and won the nomination. Dewey came under pressure from his advisors to withdraw during the dinner break that followed the second ballot, and when the convention resumed to chants of "We want Willkie!" from the packed galleries, Dewey continued to slip as the convention became a two-horse race between Taft and Willkie. Listening by radio from his hotel room, Willkie refused to make a deal to get support from Taft delegates in exchange for making the Ohioan his running mate, and became convinced he would lose on the fifth ballot. Dewey had planned to go to the convention and withdraw, hoping to stop Willkie by endorsing Taft, but by the time he decided this, the fifth ballot was about to begin and he could not get to the Civic Center in time. Willkie led with 429 delegates after the fifth ballot, while Taft held 377 and Dewey only 57. The large states whose votes still were not committed to one of the two leaders were Pennsylvania (Governor <a href="Arthur%20James%20%28politician%29">Arthur James</a> was the favorite son) and Michigan, most of whose delegates stayed with Senator Vandenberg. Although Willkie had thus far refrained from making deals, to get Michigan he agreed to allow the Republican organization there to pick that state's federal judges. The sixth ballot, held at 12:20 am on June 28, saw Taft, then Willkie take the lead. As those in the gallery continued to call for Willkie, Vandenberg released his delegates, most of whom went to Willkie. Pennsylvania also broke for him, making Willkie the Republican nominee for president on a vote that was made unanimous.
Willkie had offered the vice presidential nomination to Connecticut Governor <a href="Raymond%20Baldwin">Raymond Baldwin</a>, a key supporter, but scuttled those plans after his advisors and Republican officials felt that a New York-Connecticut ticket would not give sufficient <a href="ticket%20balance">geographic balance</a>. They urged Willkie to select the <a href="Senate%20Minority%20Leader">Senate Minority Leader</a>, Oregon's <a href="Charles%20McNary">Charles McNary</a>. A lawyer, advocate of public power, and farmer, McNary was popular and respected in the West. Willkie agreed, and got Baldwin to withdraw as others persuaded McNary, who had called Willkie a tool of Wall Street after arriving in Philadelphia. The convention dutifully nominated McNary. Before departing Philadelphia, Willkie went to the Civic Center to appear before the delegates who had chosen him, becoming the first Republican nominee to speak to the convention after gaining its endorsement:

After the convention, Willkie returned to New York. When he went to the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play "<a href="Life%20With%20Father">Life With Father</a>". He resigned from C&S on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman <a href="John%20Hamilton%20%28Kansas%29">John Hamilton</a> dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a>, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to <a href="The%20Broadmoor">The Broadmoor</a>, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.

Roosevelt had been surprised by the outcome of the Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by <a href="1940%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">the Democratic convention</a> in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> as a third party candidate.

Willkie formally accepted the nomination at Elwood on August 17 before a crowd of at least 150,000, the largest political gathering in U.S. history to that point. It was an extremely hot day, and Willkie, who tried to read his speech from a typed manuscript without enlargement, failed to ignite the crowd. He remained in Rushville, where he owned farmland, over the next month, trying to become more associated with his native state than with <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>. He gave interviews to reporters there, and his firm support of Roosevelt's aid to the Allies led Congressman Martin and Senator McNary to support a peacetime draft despite the strident objections of many Republicans and some Democrats. Roosevelt contacted Willkie through intermediaries to ensure the Republican candidate would not make a political issue out of the <a href="Destroyers%20for%20Bases%20Agreement">Destroyers for Bases Agreement</a>; Willkie was supportive of the transfer, though he felt Congress should act, and opposed Roosevelt sending armaments to Britain by <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a>.
Conservatives and isolationists had little enthusiasm for the Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see stronger positions on progressive issues and foreign policy. Publisher <a href="Henry%20Luce">Henry Luce</a> decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing to be honest with the American people, "America will never be ready for any war "until she makes her mind up there is going to be a war"." (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. The president did not mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie "to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate ... Even in Willkie's speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage". Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand <a href="Social%20Security%20%28United%20States%29">Social Security</a>, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: "I pledge a new world".

On September 12, Willkie began a <a href="Whistle%20stop%20train%20tour">whistle-stop tour</a> by train, and between then and November 2, he reached 31 of the 48 states. He did not visit the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, though he spoke in Texas, hoping to win it as Hoover had in 1928. Willkie filled the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Coliseum</a> with 70,000 middle-class supporters, but reporters saw few working-class people at his rallies, and he cancelled some appearances at auto plants in the Midwest. Other people in working-class areas booed the candidate, held up signs in support of Roosevelt, or pelted his motorcade with overripe fruit. Although Edith Willkie accompanied her husband on his tour (he had little time for contact with Van Doren), she disliked the media attention and did not give interviews, completing the campaign without ever giving a speech. On one occasion, she looked at her husband and stated, "Politics makes strange bedfellows". The Democrats knew of Willkie's affair with Van Doren, but the Republicans had letters from <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a>, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, to his former guru, Russian mystic <a href="Nicholas%20Roerich">Nicholas Roerich</a>, and neither issue became a factor in the campaign.

With polls released on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt of being a warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, but he had been advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course for the remainder of the campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's "falsifications". The president stated, "I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again. Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign war." Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary <a href="Frances%20Perkins">Frances Perkins</a>, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.
Willkie concluded his campaign on November 2 with a large rally at New York's <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden%20%281925%29">Madison Square Garden</a>. Polls showed him four points behind Roosevelt, but with a trend towards the Republicans. Many pundits expected a tight race. On Election Day, November 5, 1940, the returns were initially encouraging, but quickly turned against Willkie. By 11 pm, radio commentators were reporting that Roosevelt had won a third term. Willkie received 45 percent of the popular vote to Roosevelt's 55 percent. The president received 27.2 million votes to Willkie's 22.3 million, and won 449 to 82 in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>. Willkie won 10 states to the president's 38 though he did better than Hoover and Landon had against Roosevelt. Willkie's popular vote total of 22,348,480 set a record for a Republican not broken until <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> in 1952.

The endorsement of <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations">CIO</a> head <a href="John%20L.%20Lewis">John L. Lewis</a> probably gave Willkie Michigan, and he gained ground in the suburbs and rural areas, but Roosevelt consolidated his 1936 coalition of working-class Americans, minorities, and Southerners to take the election. On the evening of November 11, Willkie gave a nationwide radio address, urging those who had voted for him not to oppose Roosevelt on all issues, but to give support where it was called for. In late November, Willkie interrupted a Florida vacation for a speech he concluded by offering a toast "to the health and happiness of the President of the United States"; Roosevelt confided to his son <a href="James%20Roosevelt">James</a>: "I'm happy I've won, but I'm sorry Wendell lost".

Although defeated in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one for years to come. Landon had received some 6,000 letters commiserating with him in his defeat; Willkie received over 100,000. Financially independent, he was in no hurry to decide among the many offers of employment from top law firms and major corporations. He resumed his affair with Van Doren.

While on vacation, Willkie decided his next cause should be military aid to embattled <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a>, and announced support of the president's <a href="Lend-Lease%20Act">Lend-Lease program</a> on January 13, 1941. Lend-Lease was highly unpopular in the Republican Party, and Willkie's announcement created a firestorm, with Landon and Taft decrying his actions. Former RNC chairman Hamilton wrote that of the almost 200 Republican members of the House and Senate, "Willkie couldn't dig up ten friends if his life depended on it."

Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, and seeking to divide and conquer his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former opponent might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party would be far more effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.

Willkie visited the president at the White House for the first time as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before <a href="Third%20inauguration%20of%20Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt's third swearing-in</a>. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see <a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a> and <a href="Harry%20Hopkins">Harry Hopkins</a>, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">New York Municipal Field</a> for London on January 22.

Upon arrival, Willkie told the press, "I want to do all I can to get the United States to give England the utmost aid possible in her struggle". Willkie saw the damage Nazi bombing had inflicted on Britain, visiting bombed-out sites in London, <a href="Birmingham%20Blitz">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Coventry%20Blitz">Coventry</a>, <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester</a> and <a href="Liverpool%20Blitz">Liverpool</a>. In London during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask (until Churchill gave him some), visiting bomb shelters. Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> and had him as a guest at <a href="Chequers">Chequers</a>. In his writings, Churchill recalled "a long talk with this most able and forceful man".

Although it was cut short by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade <a href="%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera">Éamon de Valera</a> to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; because of the risk of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the roundabout journey home took four days. He testified before the <a href="Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.

Willkie's Senate testimony made him the leading interventionist outside the government, with Lindbergh (who had testified against Lend-Lease) the leading isolationist, and they debated in the pages of magazines. Roosevelt weighed in, backing his former opponent in a radio address on March 29. "The leader of the Republican Party himself—Mr. Wendell Willkie—in word and in action is showing what patriotic Americans mean by rising above partisanship and rallying to the common cause." That same month, a Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believed Willkie would have made a good president.

In April 1941, Willkie joined the New York law firm of Miller, Boston, and Owen as a senior partner, with the firm changing its name to <a href="Willkie%20Farr%20%26amp%3B%20Gallagher">Willkie, Owen, Otis, Farr, and Gallagher</a>. Two months later, he agreed to represent motion picture producers before a Senate subcommittee which was investigating claims that <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> was producing pro-war propaganda. Willkie defended the rights of the studios to make films that reflected their views, and warned, "the rights of the individuals mean nothing if freedom of speech and freedom of the press are destroyed." Congress took no further action.

In late 1941, Willkie fought for the repeal of the <a href="Neutrality%20Acts%20of%201930s">Neutrality Act</a>. In September, Lindbergh accused American Jews of "agitating for war"; Willkie responded that the aviator's speech was "the most un-American made in my time". Willkie lobbied Republican congressmen to repeal the act. The measure passed Congress with the aid of Republican votes, though most of that party voted against it. Roosevelt invited Willkie to dedicate <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>, but because of other commitments, Willkie could not. Roosevelt also sought to have Willkie join his administration, which the Republican was reluctant to do, wishing to preserve independence of word and action.

After the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Willkie offered his full support to Roosevelt. Willkie was interested in the post of war production czar, but that position went to <a href="Donald%20M.%20Nelson">Donald M. Nelson</a>. Labor Secretary Perkins offered to have Willkie arbitrate between management and labor in war industries, but Willkie declined after White House officials informed the press. In early 1942, Willkie considered a run for <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">Governor of New York</a>. He later stated that Roosevelt had been willing to endorse him, but Willkie ultimately concluded that the Dewey forces were too strong and a defeat might eliminate him from a possible run for president in 1944. In July, Willkie proposed to Roosevelt that he go on another foreign mission, and the following month Willkie announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union, China, and the Middle East. Dewey wrote, "I hear he is going to Russia before the Republican [state] convention, so he will be where he belongs and I hope he stays there until Christmas".

According to Dunn, Willkie's mission was to be Roosevelt's personal representative, "demonstrating American unity, gathering information, and discussing with key heads of state plans for the postwar future". After leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie's first stop was in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, where he met <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">General Montgomery</a> and toured the front at <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>. In <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, he stayed with <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">General de Gaulle</a>, leader of the <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a>. In <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Willkie met with <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, told the British rulers of <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a> that both peoples should be brought into the government, and he later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient, it was unrealistic to think that it could "be solved by good will and simple honesty". Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so. There, he met with <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>, and upon his return he advocated more liberal Lend-Lease terms for the USSR. In China, Willkie was hosted by <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> and was fascinated by <a href="Soong%20Mei-ling">Madame Chiang</a>. Willkie was taken to the front in order to observe the Chinese military forces in their fight against the Japanese, and he spoke out against <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a>, in China and elsewhere. His statements were reported widely in Britain, angering Churchill, who responded by saying, "We mean to hold our own. I have not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>."

While in the USSR, Willkie urged the opening of a second front against the Germans; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments, the president responded flippantly by saying that he had read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading. This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House.

On October 26, 1942, Willkie made a "Report to the People", telling Americans about his trip in a radio speech heard by about 36 million people. The following April, he published "<a href="One%20World%20%28book%29">One World</a>", a book Van Doren edited, in which he recounted his travels and urged America to join a supernational global organization after the war was successfully concluded. The book was an immediate bestseller, selling a million copies in its first month. It was especially influential because Willkie was seen by many as having transcended partisan politics.

During his 1940 campaign, Willkie had pledged to integrate the civil service and armed forces, and proudly pointed to what he deemed the strongest civil rights plank in history in the Republican platform. He also promised to end <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> in Washington, D.C. He gained the endorsements of the two largest African American newspapers, the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Courier">Pittsburgh Courier</a>" and the "<a href="Baltimore%20Afro-American">Baltimore Afro-American</a>". With Willkie running to the left of Roosevelt on civil rights, Roosevelt feared that blacks would return to their traditional home in the Republican Party, and he secured several prominent promotions or hirings of African Americans. Roosevelt was successful in keeping the majority of the black vote. After the election, Willkie promised to keep fighting for civil rights.

Willkie warned Republicans that only a full commitment to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) in 1942, one of the most prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent <a href="Detroit%20Race%20Riot%20%281943%29">race riot broke out in Detroit</a> in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring racial issues. When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board of <a href="Twentieth-Century%20Fox">Twentieth-Century Fox</a>. In 1943, he worked with <a href="Walter%20Francis%20White">Walter White</a>, executive secretary of the NAACP, to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie's death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.

On November 9, 1942, soon after making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people, Willkie argued the case of "<a href="Schneiderman%20v.%20United%20States">Schneiderman v. United States</a>" before the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, secretary of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship, stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization. Representing a communist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie's diminishing support in the Republican Party, but he wrote to a friend saying, "I am sure I am right in representing Schneiderman. Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended, it is now." In his argument Willkie quoted <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Jefferson</a> by saying that the people could, if they deemed it necessary, remake the government, and he stated that Marx's view of revolution was mild by comparison. In 1943, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruled for Schneiderman, 5–3, restoring his citizenship. Although Willkie refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's <a href="internment%20of%20Japanese%20Americans">internment of Japanese Americans</a>, he stated in a speech that war was no excuse for depriving groups of people of their rights. He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war, warning against "witch-hanging and mob-baiting". For his activities, he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.

Willkie spent much of 1943 preparing for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.

Willkie made his candidacy clear in an interview with <a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Look" magazine</a> in early October 1943, arguing that a return to isolationism would lead the party to disaster. He decided to enter several presidential primaries in order to demonstrate his public support of the party, and he chose <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, with a primary on April 4, 1944, as the first major test. Willkie had not taken Wisconsin's electoral votes in 1940, though he had won in all parts of the state except <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>. His advisors feared the large <a href="German%20Americans">German-American</a> vote in Wisconsin, which had contributed to the state being firmly isolationist until Pearl Harbor. None of the other major candidates—Dewey, Stassen, MacArthur and Ohio Governor <a href="John%20Bricker">John Bricker</a>—spoke in Wisconsin; MacArthur and Stassen were on active duty and could not do so. Willkie stated that if he did badly in Wisconsin, he would end his campaign.

The <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> primary had not taken on the significance it later would, and Willkie won it on March 14, taking six out of eleven delegates. This was deemed a disappointment because he had spoken there many times since 1940, and was expected to do better. In Wisconsin, Willkie ran a slate of delegates led by future governor <a href="Vernon%20Wallace%20Thomson">Vernon W. Thomson</a>, and he devoted two weeks to campaigning there. He was endorsed by most newspapers, but polls showed him well behind Dewey both in the state and nationwide.

On March 16, his first day of campaigning in Wisconsin, Willkie made eight speeches, and the pace took a toll on his voice. The weather did not cooperate, and he travelled through a blizzard to reach a rally in the northern part of the state. Willkie attracted large crowds in most places, and he told them that the Republican party would fail unless it accepted the New Deal and recognized the need for the U.S. to remain active in the world after the war. The Democrats, he alleged, had been in office too long and they did not have the vision that was needed in the postwar world. Willkie's speech in Milwaukee attracted 4,000 people to a hall that could hold 6,000, and he left the state on the 29th for <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, where he had also entered the primary. Once he was gone, Dewey's backers, including most of the Wisconsin Republican leadership, flooded the state with billboard advertisements and radio commercials. On April 4, Dewey gained 17 of Wisconsin's 24 delegates, Stassen 4, and MacArthur 3. Willkie's delegates ran last in every district. The following night, after giving his speech in Omaha, Willkie addressed the crowd:

Defeated in his second bid for the White House, Willkie announced that he was returning to the practice of law, but his friends doubted that he would be content there. Roosevelt was anxious to dump Vice President Wallace from the ticket in his bid for a fourth term, and he had an intermediary sound out Willkie about running in Wallace's place. Willkie was reluctant even to respond, knowing that Roosevelt had made promises to potential running mates which he did not follow through on. There were further discussions between Willkie and the White House, of which third parties were aware though the details are not known; the vice presidential nomination went to <a href="Harry%20S%20Truman">Harry S Truman</a>. Willkie got Roosevelt interested in a new liberal party which would be formed once peace came that would combine the left of the two existing major parties, but Willkie broke off contact with the White House after there were leaks of this to the press, because he felt that Roosevelt had used him for political gain. Roosevelt sent a letter expressing his regret for the leak, but that too was printed in the papers, and Willkie stated, "I've been lied to for the last time."

In spite of their breach, Roosevelt continued to try to conciliate Willkie. Roosevelt's son <a href="Elliott%20Roosevelt">Elliott</a> later stated that his father hoped to have Willkie be the first <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary General of the United Nations</a>, and the two men agreed to meet later in the year. Willkie had not been invited to speak at the <a href="1944%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1944 Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago that nominated Dewey for president, and he declined a pass as an "honored guest". Dewey hoped to get Willkie's endorsement, and he sent his foreign policy advisor, <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a>, to see Willkie. The former candidate refused to be drawn, and he made no endorsement before he died. Willkie wrote two articles for <a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>, one urging an internationalist foreign policy, and the other demanding advances in civil rights for African Americans. He also explored becoming a newspaper publisher.

Willkie had long been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. His heavy drinking had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home. There, he suffered a <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a>, but he had to be persuaded to see a doctor and he refused to be admitted to a hospital.

Willkie's condition only worsened as the weeks went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance to take him to <a href="Lenox%20Hill%20Hospital">Lenox Hill Hospital</a>. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, "An American Program", and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught <a href="Streptococcal%20pharyngitis">a throat infection</a>, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.

Roosevelt released a statement applauding Willkie's "tremendous courage" which "prompted him more than once to stand alone ... In this hour of grave crisis the nation loses a great citizen." War Secretary Stimson offered to have Willkie buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, but Edith Willkie wanted her husband to be buried in his native Indiana, at Rushville. His casket was placed in the center aisle of the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20Presbyterian%20Church">Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church</a>; 60,000 people filed by his casket, and 35,000 crowded around the church during the service, including many blacks—as, Eleanor Roosevelt noted in her column, was fitting. Wendell and Edith Willkie rest together in Rushville's <a href="East%20Hill%20Cemetery%20%28Rushville%2C%20Indiana%29">East Hill Cemetery</a>, the gravesite was marked by a cross, and a book was carved in stone, designed by sculptor <a href="Malvina%20Hoffman">Malvina Hoffman</a>, and inscribed with quotations from "One World".

Willkie's 1940 running mate, McNary, died eight months before him, on February 25. It was the first, and to date only, time both members of a major-party presidential ticket died during the term for which they sought election. Had they been elected, the <a href="Presidential%20Succession%20Act%20of%201886">Presidential Succession Act of 1886</a> would have been invoked upon Willkie's death, and his <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> would have been sworn in as <a href="Acting%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Acting President</a> for the remainder of the term ending on January 20, 1945.

Soon after the 1940 convention, Roosevelt described Willkie's nomination as a "Godsend to our country", because it ensured that the presidential race would not turn on the issue of aid to Britain. <a href="Walter%20Lippmann">Walter Lippmann</a> believed Willkie's nomination to have been crucial to Britain's survival, "second only to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [Britain] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned". <a href="Charles%20Peters">Charles Peters</a> wrote that "it is arguable that [Willkie's] impact on [the United States] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [of president]. At a crucial moment in history, he stood for the right things at the right time." When Georgia Senator <a href="Zell%20Miller">Zell Miller</a>, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the <a href="2004%20Republican%20National%20Convention">2004 Republican National Convention</a>, he urged unity instead of partisan strife in the <a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a>, and recalled Willkie's actions, "He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time. And he made it clear that he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue."

Historian Hugh Ross argued that in gaining the nomination, Willkie "gave exceptional promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. In most of the previous instances, the nomination had gone to a military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." <a href="Richard%20Moe">Richard Moe</a>, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its <a href="Eastern%20Establishment">Eastern Establishment</a> wing; "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford">Gerald R. Ford</a>, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, "I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a lot of difference to me."

Correspondent and author Warren Moscow wrote that after 1940, Willkie helped Roosevelt, who was always careful not to go too far in front of public opinion, "as a pace-setter with the President's blessing". Willkie's global trip and the publication of "One World" increased public support for the idea that the United States should remain active internationally once the war was won, and should not withdraw into a new isolationism. Indiana University president <a href="Herman%20B%20Wells">Herman B Wells</a> noted that "One World" "has had such a profound influence on the thinking of Americans". Zipp noted, "He launched the most successful and unprecedented challenge to conventional nationalism in modern American history ... He urged [Americans] to imagine and feel a new form of reciprocity with the world, one that millions of Americans responded to with unprecedented urgency."

His advocacy came at a cost to his standing in the Republican Party. According to Moscow, "his appeal for the party to be the party of the Loyal Opposition, supporting the President, was treason to the diehards; his trip around the world marked him as a Presidential agent seeking to infiltrate the Republican Party". This decline was accelerated as it became apparent that Willkie was a liberal, standing to the left of Roosevelt and proposing even higher taxes than the president was willing to stomach.

In 1965, Indiana University completed Willkie Quadrangle, an 11-story undergraduate residence hall, on the Bloomington campus that was named after Willkie.

In 1992, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> marked the centennial of Willkie's birth with a 75-cent stamp in the <a href="Great%20Americans%20series">Great Americans series</a>. Dunn concluded that Willkie "died as he had lived, an idealist, a humanitarian—and a lone wolf". Willkie's biographer, Neal, wrote of him,

Xenon

Xenon is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Xe and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 54. It is a colorless, dense, odorless <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a> found in the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">Earth's atmosphere</a> in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s such as the formation of <a href="xenon%20hexafluoroplatinate">xenon hexafluoroplatinate</a>, the first <a href="noble%20gas%20compound">noble gas compound</a> to be synthesized.

Xenon is used in <a href="Flashtube%23Xenon">flash lamps</a> and <a href="xenon%20arc%20lamp">arc lamps</a>, and as a <a href="general%20anaesthesia">general anesthetic</a>. The first <a href="excimer%20laser">excimer laser</a> design used a xenon <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimer</a> molecule (Xe) as the <a href="Active%20laser%20medium">lasing medium</a>, and the earliest <a href="laser">laser</a> designs used xenon flash lamps as <a href="Laser%20pumping">pumps</a>. Xenon is used to search for hypothetical <a href="weakly%20interacting%20massive%20particles">weakly interacting massive particles</a> and as the <a href="propellant">propellant</a> for <a href="ion%20thruster">ion thruster</a>s in spacecraft.

Naturally occurring xenon consists of <a href="Isotopes%20of%20xenon">eight stable isotopes</a>. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>, and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. Radioactive <a href="xenon-135">xenon-135</a> is produced by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> from <a href="Isotopes%20of%20iodine%23Iodine-135">iodine-135</a> (a product of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>), and is the most significant (and unwanted) <a href="Neutron%20capture">neutron absorber</a> in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s.

Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist <a href="William%20Ramsay">William Ramsay</a> and English chemist <a href="Morris%20Travers">Morris Travers</a> in September 1898, shortly after their discovery of the elements <a href="krypton">krypton</a> and <a href="neon">neon</a>. They found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of <a href="liquid%20air">liquid air</a>. Ramsay suggested the name "xenon" for this gas from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word ξένον [xenon], neuter singular form of ξένος [xenos], meaning 'foreign(er)', 'strange(r)', or 'guest'. In 1902, Ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth's atmosphere to be one part in 20 million.

During the 1930s, American engineer <a href="Harold%20Eugene%20Edgerton">Harold Edgerton</a> began exploring <a href="strobe%20light">strobe light</a> technology for <a href="High-speed%20photography">high speed photography</a>. This led him to the invention of the xenon <a href="Flashtube">flash lamp</a> in which light is generated by passing brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one <a href="microsecond">microsecond</a> with this method.

In 1939, American physician <a href="Albert%20R.%20Behnke">Albert R. Behnke</a> Jr. began exploring the causes of "drunkenness" in deep-sea divers. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an <a href="Anesthesia">anesthetic</a>. Although Russian toxicologist <a href="Nikolay%20Lazarev">Nikolay V. Lazarev</a> apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by American medical researcher John H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully used it with two patients.

Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a>. However, while teaching at the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>, <a href="Neil%20Bartlett%20%28chemist%29">Neil Bartlett</a> discovered that the gas <a href="platinum%20hexafluoride">platinum hexafluoride</a> (PtF) was a powerful <a href="Redox">oxidizing</a> agent that could oxidize oxygen gas (O) to form <a href="dioxygenyl%20hexafluoroplatinate">dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate</a> (). Since O and xenon have almost the same first <a href="Ionization%20energy">ionization potential</a>, Bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon. On March 23, 1962, he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas, <a href="xenon%20hexafluoroplatinate">xenon hexafluoroplatinate</a>. Bartlett thought its composition to be Xe[PtF], but later work revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon-containing salts. Since then, many other xenon compounds have been discovered, in addition to some compounds of the noble gases <a href="argon">argon</a>, <a href="krypton">krypton</a>, and <a href="radon">radon</a>, including <a href="argon%20fluorohydride">argon fluorohydride</a> (HArF), <a href="krypton%20difluoride">krypton difluoride</a> (KrF), and <a href="Radon%20difluoride">radon fluoride</a>. By 1971, more than 80 xenon compounds were known.

In November 1989, <a href="IBM">IBM</a> scientists demonstrated a technology capable of manipulating individual <a href="atom">atom</a>s. The program, called <a href="IBM%20%28atoms%29">IBM in atoms</a>, used a <a href="scanning%20tunneling%20microscope">scanning tunneling microscope</a> to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of <a href="nickel">nickel</a> to spell out the three letter company initialism. It was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.

Xenon has <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 54; that is, its nucleus contains 54 <a href="proton">proton</a>s. At <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761 kg/m, about 4.5 times the density of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217 kg/m. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100 g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even water. Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640 g/cm, is greater than the average density of <a href="granite">granite</a>, 2.75 g/cm. Under <a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">gigapascals</a> of <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, xenon forms a metallic phase.

Solid xenon changes from <a href="face-centered%20cubic">face-centered cubic</a> (fcc) to <a href="Close-packing%20of%20spheres">hexagonal close packed</a> (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140 GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155 GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.
Liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting Xe ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification.

Xenon is a member of the zero-<a href="Valence%20%28chemistry%29">valence</a> elements that are called <a href="noble%20gas">noble</a> or <a href="inert%20gas">inert gas</a>es. It is inert to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer <a href="valence%20shell">valence shell</a> contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.

In a <a href="gas-filled%20tube">gas-filled tube</a>, xenon emits a <a href="blue">blue</a> or <a href="lavender%20%28color%29">lavenderish</a> glow when excited by <a href="Electric%20arc">electrical discharge</a>. Xenon emits a band of <a href="Spectral%20line">emission lines</a> that span the visual spectrum, but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light, producing the coloration.

Xenon is a <a href="trace%20gas">trace gas</a> in <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, occurring at (<a href="parts%20per%20billion">parts per billion</a>), or approximately 1 part per 11.5 million. It is also found as a component of gases emitted from some <a href="mineral%20spring">mineral spring</a>s.

Xenon is obtained commercially as a by-product of the <a href="air%20separation">separation of air</a> into <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. After this separation, generally performed by <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> in a double-column plant, the <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto <a href="silica%20gel">silica gel</a> or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into <a href="krypton">krypton</a> and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000 m. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10 <a href="Euro">€</a>/L for xenon, 1 €/L for krypton, and 0.20 €/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.

Within the Solar System, the <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a> fraction of xenon is , for an <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">abundance</a> of approximately one part in 630 thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>'s atmosphere, on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, and in <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s and <a href="comet">comet</a>s. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> is unusually high, about 2.6 times that of the Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the <a href="solar%20nebula">presolar disk</a>. (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>ing of xenon to oxygen within <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.

Unlike the lower-mass noble gases, the normal <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than <a href="iron-56">iron-56</a> consume energy through fusion, and the synthesis of xenon represents no energy gain for a star. Instead, xenon is formed during <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions, in classical <a href="nova">nova</a> explosions, by the slow neutron-capture process (<a href="s-process">s-process</a>) in <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a>, and from radioactive decay, for example by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of <a href="extinct%20radionuclide">extinct</a> <a href="iodine-129">iodine-129</a> and <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> of <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, and <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>.

Naturally occurring xenon is composed of eight <a href="stable%20isotope">stable</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. This is more than any other element except <a href="tin">tin</a>, which has ten. The isotopes Xe and Xe are predicted by theory to undergo <a href="double%20beta%20decay">double beta decay</a>, but this has never been observed so they are considered stable. In addition, more than 40 unstable isotopes that have been studied. The longest lived of these isotopes is Xe, which undergoes double beta decay with a half-life of . Xe is produced by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of <a href="iodine">I</a>, which has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 16 million years. Xe, Xe, Xe, and Xe are some of the <a href="nuclear%20fission">fission</a> products of <a href="uranium">U</a> and <a href="plutonium">Pu</a>, and are used to detect and monitor nuclear explosions.

Nuclei of two of the stable <a href="isotopes%20of%20xenon">isotopes of xenon</a>, Xe and Xe, have non-zero intrinsic <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momenta</a> (<a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">nuclear spins</a>, suitable for <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a>). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> vapor. The resulting <a href="spin%20polarization">spin polarization</a> of xenon <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by <a href="paramagnetic">paramagnetic</a> statistics (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>, even in the strongest <a href="magnet">magnet</a>s). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called "<a href="hyperpolarization%20%28physics%29">hyperpolarization</a>". The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called "optical pumping" (although the process is different from <a href="optical%20pumping">pumping a laser</a>).

Because a Xe nucleus has a <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> of 1/2, and therefore a zero <a href="electric%20field">electric</a> <a href="quadrupole%20moment">quadrupole moment</a>, the Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms, and the hyperpolarization persists for long periods even after the engendering light and vapor have been removed. Spin polarization of Xe can persist from several <a href="second">second</a>s for xenon atoms dissolved in <a href="blood">blood</a> to several hours in the <a href="gas%20phase">gas phase</a> and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon. In contrast, <a href="isotopes%20of%20xenon">Xe</a> has a nuclear spin value of and a nonzero <a href="quadrupole%20moment">quadrupole moment</a>, and has t relaxation times in the <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a> and <a href="second">second</a> ranges.

Some radioactive isotopes of xenon (for example, Xe and Xe) are produced by <a href="neutron">neutron</a> irradiation of fissionable material within <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s. <a href="Xenon-135">Xe</a> is of considerable significance in the operation of <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear fission reactors</a>. Xe has a huge <a href="Neutron%20cross-section">cross section</a> for <a href="thermal%20neutron">thermal neutron</a>s, 2.6×10 <a href="Barn%20%28unit%29">barns</a>, and operates as a <a href="neutron%20absorber">neutron absorber</a> or "<a href="nuclear%20poison">poison</a>" that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation. This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> for <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> production. However, the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor's reactivity (the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of <a href="nuclear%20fuel">nuclear fuel</a>).
Xe reactor poisoning was a major factor in the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster%23Conditions%20before%20the%20accident">Chernobyl disaster</a>. A shutdown or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of Xe, with reactor operation going into a condition known as the <a href="iodine%20pit">iodine pit</a>.

Under adverse conditions, relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may emanate from cracked <a href="fuel%20rod">fuel rod</a>s, or fissioning of uranium in <a href="Water%20cooling">cooling water</a>.

Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s are a powerful tool for studying the <a href="formation%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">formation of the Solar System</a>. The <a href="Iodine%E2%80%93xenon%20dating">iodine–xenon method</a> of <a href="Radiometric%20dating">dating</a> gives the time elapsed between <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> and the condensation of a solid object from the <a href="solar%20nebula">solar nebula</a>. In 1960, physicist <a href="John%20Reynolds%20%28physicist%29">John H. Reynolds</a> discovered that certain <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a> of radioactive <a href="iodine-129">iodine-129</a>. This isotope is produced slowly by <a href="cosmic%20ray%20spallation">cosmic ray spallation</a> and <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, because the I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.

In a similar way, xenon isotopic ratios such as Xe/Xe and Xe/Xe are a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, the <a href="atmosphere%20of%20Mars">atmosphere of Mars</a> shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth (0.08 parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess Xe found in <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> well gases from <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> is believed to be from the decay of <a href="Mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a>-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.

After Neil Bartlett's discovery in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the <a href="electronegative">electronegative</a> atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element <a href="iodine">iodine</a> in the immediately lower oxidation state.

Three <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>s are known: <a href="xenon%20difluoride"></a>, <a href="xenon%20tetrafluoride"></a>, and <a href="xenon%20hexafluoride"></a>. XeF is theorized to be unstable. These are the starting points for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds.

The solid, crystalline difluoride is formed when a mixture of <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet component of ordinary daylight is sufficient. Long-term heating of at high temperatures under an catalyst yields . Pyrolysis of in the presence of <a href="sodium%20fluoride">NaF</a> yields high-purity .

The xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors, forming salts that contain such cations as and , and anions such as , , and . The green, paramagnetic is formed by the reduction of by xenon gas.

Whereas the xenon fluorides are well characterized, with the exception of dichloride <a href="Xenon%20dichloride">XeCl</a>, the other halides are not known. Xenon dichloride, formed by the high-frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon, fluorine, and <a href="silicon%20tetrachloride">silicon</a> or <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a>, is reported to be an endothermic, colorless, crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at 80 °C. However, may be merely a <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20molecule">van der Waals molecule</a> of weakly bound Xe atoms and molecules and not a real compound. Theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule is less stable than the van der Waals complex.

Three oxides of xenon are known: <a href="xenon%20trioxide">xenon trioxide</a> () and <a href="xenon%20tetroxide">xenon tetroxide</a> (), both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents, and <a href="xenon%20dioxide">xenon dioxide</a> (XeO), which was reported in 2011 with a <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a> of four. XeO forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice. Its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals. The XeOO cation has been identified by <a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a> in solid <a href="argon">argon</a>.

Xenon does not react with oxygen directly; the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of :

Barium perxenate, when treated with concentrated <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>, yields gaseous xenon tetroxide:

To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9 °C into xenon and oxygen gas.

A number of xenon oxyfluorides are known, including , <a href="xenon%20oxytetrafluoride"></a>, , and . is formed by reacting <a href="oxygen%20difluoride"></a> with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by partial hydrolysis of . It disproportionates at −20 °C into and . is formed by the partial hydrolysis of , or the reaction of with sodium perxenate, . The latter reaction also produces a small amount of . reacts with <a href="caesium%20fluoride">CsF</a> to form the anion, while XeOF reacts with the alkali metal fluorides <a href="potassium%20fluoride">KF</a>, <a href="rubidium%20fluoride">RbF</a> and CsF to form the anion.

Recently, there has been an interest in xenon compounds where xenon is directly bonded to a less electronegative element than fluorine or oxygen, particularly <a href="carbon">carbon</a>. Electron-withdrawing groups, such as groups with fluorine substitution, are necessary to stabilize these compounds. Numerous such compounds have been characterized, including:

Other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include and . The latter is synthesized from <a href="dioxygenyl">dioxygenyl</a> tetrafluoroborate, , at −100 °C.

An unusual ion containing xenon is the <a href="tetraxenonogold%28II%29">tetraxenonogold(II)</a> cation, , which contains Xe–Au bonds. This ion occurs in the compound , and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, xenon and <a href="gold">gold</a>, with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand.

The compound contains a Xe–Xe bond, the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 <a href="Angstrom">Å</a>).

In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, scientists at the <a href="University%20of%20Helsinki">University of Helsinki</a> in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, announced the preparation of xenon dihydride (HXeH), and later xenon hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules. In 2008, Khriachtchev "et al." reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the <a href="photolysis">photolysis</a> of water within a <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> xenon matrix. <a href="Deuterium">Deuterated</a> molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.

In addition to compounds where xenon forms a <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>, xenon can form <a href="clathrate">clathrate</a>s—substances where xenon atoms or pairs are trapped by the <a href="Crystal%20structure">crystalline lattice</a> of another compound. One example is <a href="xenon%20hydrate">xenon hydrate</a> (Xe•5.75 HO), where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules. This clathrate has a melting point of 24 °C. The <a href="deuterate">deuterate</a>d version of this hydrate has also been produced. Another example is xenon <a href="hydride">hydride</a> (Xe(H)), in which xenon pairs (dimers) are trapped inside <a href="solid%20hydrogen">solid hydrogen</a>. Such <a href="clathrate%20hydrate">clathrate hydrate</a>s can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure,
such as in <a href="Lake%20Vostok">Lake Vostok</a> underneath the <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> ice sheet. Clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon, argon and krypton.

Xenon can also form <a href="endohedral%20fullerene">endohedral fullerene</a> compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a <a href="fullerene">fullerene</a> molecule. The xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be observed by Xe <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive <a href="chemical%20shift">chemical shift</a> of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.

When xenon atoms are in the <a href="stationary%20state">ground energy state</a>, they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an <a href="excimer">excimer</a> (excited dimer) until the electrons return to the <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost <a href="Electron%20shell">electronic shell</a> by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1–5 ns, and the decay releases <a href="photon">photon</a>s with <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s of about 150 and 173 <a href="Nanometre">nm</a>. Xenon can also form excimers with other elements, such as the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, and <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>.

Although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the <a href="atmosphere%20of%20Earth">Earth's atmosphere</a>, it has a number of applications.

Xenon is used in light-emitting devices called xenon flash lamps, used in <a href="Flash%20%28photography%29">photographic flashes</a> and stroboscopic lamps; to excite the <a href="active%20laser%20medium">active medium</a> in <a href="laser">laser</a>s which then generate <a href="coherent%20light">coherent light</a>; and, occasionally, in <a href="Bactericide">bactericidal</a> lamps. The first solid-state <a href="laser">laser</a>, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power <a href="inertial%20confinement%20fusion">inertial confinement fusion</a> are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.

Continuous, short-arc, high pressure <a href="xenon%20arc%20lamp">xenon arc lamp</a>s have a <a href="color%20temperature">color temperature</a> closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in <a href="Solar%20Simulator">solar simulators</a>. That is, the <a href="chromaticity">chromaticity</a> of these lamps closely approximates a heated <a href="black%20body">black body</a> radiator at the temperature of the Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived <a href="carbon%20arc%20lamp">carbon arc lamp</a>s in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical <a href="35%20mm%20film">35mm</a>, <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a>, and <a href="digital%20projectors">digital</a> <a href="Movie%20projector">film projection</a> systems. They are an excellent source of short wavelength <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation and have intense emissions in the near <a href="infrared">infrared</a> used in some <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a> systems. Xenon is used as a starter gas in <a href="High-intensity%20discharge%20lamp">HID</a> automotive headlights, and high-end <a href="tactical%20light">"tactical" flashlights</a>.

The individual cells in a <a href="plasma%20display">plasma display</a> contain a mixture of xenon and neon ionized with <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet <a href="photon">photon</a>s, which then excite the <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a> coating on the front of the display.

Xenon is used as a "starter gas" in <a href="Sodium%20vapor%20lamp">high pressure sodium lamps</a>. It has the lowest <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> and lowest <a href="ionization%20potential">ionization potential</a> of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the <a href="breakdown%20voltage">breakdown voltage</a> of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.

In 1962, a group of researchers at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Laboratories</a> discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding <a href="helium">helium</a> to the lasing medium. The first <a href="excimer%20laser">excimer laser</a> used a xenon <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimer</a> (Xe) energized by a beam of electrons to produce <a href="stimulated%20emission">stimulated emission</a> at an <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> wavelength of 176 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>.
Xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer (or, more accurately, exciplex) lasers.

Xenon has been used as a <a href="general%20anesthetic">general anesthetic</a>. Although it is expensive, anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are expected to appear on the European market because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.

Xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels, and like many theoretically multi-modal inhalation anesthetics, these interactions are likely complementary. Xenon is a high-affinity glycine-site <a href="NMDA%20receptor%20antagonist">NMDA receptor antagonist</a>. However, xenon is different from certain other NMDA receptor antagonists in that it is not <a href="neurotoxicity">neurotoxic</a> and it inhibits the neurotoxicity of <a href="ketamine">ketamine</a> and <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>, while actually producing <a href="neuroprotection">neuroprotective effects</a>. Unlike ketamine and nitrous oxide, xenon does not stimulate a dopamine efflux in the <a href="nucleus%20accumbens">nucleus accumbens</a>. Like nitrous oxide and <a href="cyclopropane">cyclopropane</a>, xenon activates the two-pore domain potassium channel <a href="KCNK2">TREK-1</a>. A related channel <a href="KCNK9">TASK-3</a> also implicated in the actions of inhalation anesthetics is insensitive to xenon. Xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine <a href="Alpha-4%20beta-2%20nicotinic%20receptor">αβ</a> receptors which contribute to spinally mediated analgesia. Xenon is an effective inhibitor of <a href="Plasma%20membrane%20Ca2%2B%20ATPase">plasma membrane Ca ATPase</a>. Xenon inhibits Ca ATPase by binding to a hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active conformations.

Xenon is a competitive inhibitor of the serotonin <a href="5-HT3%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a>. While neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive, this reduces anesthesia-emergent nausea and vomiting.

Xenon has a <a href="minimum%20alveolar%20concentration">minimum alveolar concentration</a> (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than NO as an anesthetic. Thus, it can be used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>. Unlike <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a> (NO), xenon is not a <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> and is viewed as <a href="environmentally%20friendly">environmentally friendly</a>. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.

Xenon induces robust <a href="cardioprotection">cardioprotection</a> and <a href="neuroprotection">neuroprotection</a> through a variety of mechanisms. Through its influence on Ca, K, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, xenon is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after <a href="Ischemia">ischemic</a> insults. Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing <a href="Pharmacology">pharmacologic</a> non-ischemic preconditioning. Xenon is cardioprotective by activating PKC-epsilon and downstream p38-MAPK. Xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating ATP sensitive potassium channels. Xenon allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency.

Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture activates production of the <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> <a href="HIF1A">HIF-1-alpha</a>, which may lead to increased production of <a href="erythropoietin">erythropoietin</a>. The latter hormone is known to increase <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a> production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation has been used in Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the <a href="World%20Anti%20Doping%20Agency">World Anti Doping Agency</a> (WADA) added xenon (and <a href="argon">argon</a>) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.

<a href="gamma%20ray">Gamma</a> emission from the <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a> Xe of xenon can be used to image the heart, lungs, and brain, for example, by means of <a href="single%20photon%20emission%20computed%20tomography">single photon emission computed tomography</a>. Xe has also been used to measure <a href="blood%20flow">blood flow</a>.

Xenon, particularly hyperpolarized Xe, is a useful contrast agent for <a href="MRI">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI). In the gas phase, it can image cavities in a porous sample, alveoli in lungs, or the flow of gases within the lungs. Because xenon is soluble both in water and in hydrophobic solvents, it can image various soft living tissues.

The xenon chloride <a href="excimer%20laser">excimer laser</a> has certain dermatological uses.

Because of the xenon atom's large, flexible outer electron shell, the <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">NMR</a> spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions and can be used to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.

Hyperpolarized xenon can be used by <a href="Surface%20science">surface chemists</a>. Normally, it is difficult to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by <a href="Proton%20Enhanced%20Nuclear%20Induction%20Spectroscopy">transferring spin polarization to them</a> from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.

In <a href="Nuclear%20physics">nuclear energy</a> studies, xenon is used in <a href="bubble%20chamber">bubble chamber</a>s, probes, and in other areas where a high <a href="Molecular%20mass">molecular weight</a> and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> testing is the release of radioactive <a href="isotopes%20of%20xenon">xenon-133 and xenon-135</a>. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear <a href="Test%20Ban%20Treaty%20%28disambiguation%29">test ban treaties</a>, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>.
Liquid xenon is used in <a href="Calorimeter%20%28particle%20physics%29">calorimeters</a> to measure <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, and as a detector of hypothetical <a href="weakly%20interacting%20massive%20particles">weakly interacting massive particles</a>, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and <a href="Scintillation%20%28physics%29">scintillation</a>. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.

Xenon is the preferred <a href="propellant">propellant</a> for <a href="ion%20propulsion">ion propulsion</a> of <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> because it has low <a href="ionization%20potential">ionization potential</a> per <a href="Atomic%20mass">atomic weight</a> and can be stored as a liquid at near <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a> (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an <a href="ion%20engine">ion engine</a> than other fuels such as <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> or <a href="caesium">caesium</a>. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's <a href="Deep%20Space%201">Deep Space 1</a> probe, Europe's <a href="SMART-1">SMART-1</a> spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's <a href="Dawn%20Spacecraft">Dawn Spacecraft</a>.

Chemically, the <a href="perxenate">perxenate</a> compounds are used as <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>s in <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analytical chemistry</a>. <a href="Xenon%20difluoride">Xenon difluoride</a> is used as an etchant for <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, particularly in the production of <a href="microelectromechanical%20systems">microelectromechanical systems</a> (MEMS). The anticancer drug <a href="Fluorouracil">5-fluorouracil</a> can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with <a href="uracil">uracil</a>. Xenon is also used in <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">protein crystallography</a>. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">MPa</a> (5 to 50 <a href="atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atm</a>) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly <a href="Hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a> cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative that can be used for solving the <a href="phase%20problem">phase problem</a>.

Because they are strongly <a href="oxidative">oxidative</a>, many oxygen-<a href="xenon%20compounds">xenon compounds</a> are toxic; they are also explosive (highly <a href="Exothermic%20process">exothermic</a>), breaking down to elemental xenon and <a href="Diatomic%20molecule">diatomic</a> oxygen (O) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.

Xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-<a href="toxic">toxic</a>, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>, causing mild to full surgical <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a> when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.

The <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> in xenon gas (169 m/s) is less than that in air because the average velocity of the heavy xenon atoms is less than that of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the <a href="vocal%20tract">vocal cords</a> when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in <a href="helium">helium</a>. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple <a href="asphyxiant%20gas">asphyxiant</a> and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas <a href="sulfur%20hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a> is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.

Dense gases such as xenon and sulfur hexafluoride can be breathed safely when mixed with at least 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% concentration along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and has been used for this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.

Yellowstone National Park

Yellowstone National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> located in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, and <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. It was established by the <a href="U.S.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCongress">U.S. Congress</a> and signed into law by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many <a href="Geothermal%20areas%20of%20Yellowstone">geothermal features</a>, especially <a href="Old%20Faithful">Old Faithful</a> geyser, one of its most popular features. It has many types of <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s, but the <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> forest is the most abundant. It is part of the <a href="South%20Central%20Rockies%20forests">South Central Rockies forests</a> ecoregion.

Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. Aside from visits by <a href="mountain%20man">mountain men</a> during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, the first being <a href="Columbus%20Delano">Columbus Delano</a>. However, the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.

Yellowstone National Park spans an area of , comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>s. <a href="Yellowstone%20Lake">Yellowstone Lake</a> is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and is centered over the <a href="Yellowstone%20Caldera">Yellowstone Caldera</a>, the largest <a href="supervolcano">supervolcano</a> on the continent. The <a href="caldera">caldera</a> is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. <a href="Lava">Lava</a> flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> or <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a>. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest and most famous <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> location in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. <a href="Grizzly%20bear">Grizzly bear</a>s, <a href="gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, and free-ranging herds of <a href="American%20bison">bison</a> and <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20elk">elk</a> live in this park. The <a href="Yellowstone%20Park%20bison%20herd">Yellowstone Park bison herd</a> is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. <a href="Forest%20fire">Forest fire</a>s occur in the park each year; in the <a href="Yellowstone%20fires%20of%201988">large forest fires of 1988</a>, nearly one third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either <a href="snow%20coach">snow coach</a>es or <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a>s.

The park contains the headwaters of the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a>, from which it takes its historical name. Near the end of the 18th century, <a href="Coureur%20des%20bois">French trappers</a> named the river ', which is probably a translation of the <a href="Hidatsa">Hidatsa</a> name ' ("Yellow Rock River"). Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as "Yellow Stone". Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Yellowstone">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</a>, the Native American name source is unclear.

The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when Native Americans began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in <a href="Gardiner%2C%20Montana">Gardiner, Montana</a>, in the 1950s, an <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a> projectile point of <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis</a> origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. These <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indians</a>, of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of obsidian found in the park to make <a href="cutting%20tool">cutting tool</a>s and <a href="weapon">weapon</a>s. <a href="Arrowhead">Arrowhead</a>s made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the <a href="Mississippi%20Valley">Mississippi Valley</a>, indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. By the time <a href="White%20people">white</a> <a href="Exploration">explorers</a> first entered the region during the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> in 1805, they encountered the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20%28tribe%29">Nez Perce</a>, <a href="Crow%20Indians">Crow</a>, and <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members heard of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it.

In 1806, <a href="John%20Colter">John Colter</a>, a member of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 1807–1808. He observed at least one <a href="Geothermal%20%28geology%29">geothermal</a> area in the northeastern section of the park, near <a href="Tower%20Fall">Tower Fall</a>. After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and <a href="Blackfoot">Blackfoot</a> tribes in 1809, Colter described a place of "<a href="fire%20and%20brimstone">fire and brimstone</a>" that most people dismissed as delirium; the supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "<a href="Colter%27s%20Hell">Colter's Hell</a>". Over the next 40 years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers, and <a href="Petrifaction">petrified</a> trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth.

After an 1856 exploration, mountain man <a href="Jim%20Bridger">Jim Bridger</a> (also believed to be the first or second European American to have seen the <a href="Great%20Salt%20Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>) reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was a known "spinner of yarns". In 1859, a U.S. Army Surveyor named Captain <a href="William%20F.%20Raynolds">William F. Raynolds</a> embarked on a <a href="Raynolds%20Expedition">two-year survey</a> of the northern Rockies. After wintering in Wyoming, in May 1860, Raynolds and his party – which included naturalist <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden</a> and guide Jim Bridger – attempted to cross the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> over <a href="Parting%20of%20the%20Waters">Two Ocean Plateau</a> from the <a href="Wind%20River%20%28Wyoming%29">Wind River</a> drainage in northwest Wyoming. Heavy spring snows prevented their passage, but had they been able to traverse the divide, the party would have been the first organized survey to enter the Yellowstone region. The <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s.
The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the <a href="Cook%E2%80%93Folsom%E2%80%93Peterson%20Expedition">Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition</a> of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the <a href="Washburn%E2%80%93Langford%E2%80%93Doane%20Expedition">Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition</a> in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana <a href="Henry%20D.%20Washburn">Henry Washburn</a>, and included <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Langford">Nathaniel P. Langford</a> (who later became known as "National Park" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt. <a href="Gustavus%20Cheyney%20Doane">Gustavus Doane</a>.

The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a national park; he wrote detailed articles about his observations for the "Helena Herald" newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor <a href="Thomas%20Francis%20Meagher">Thomas Francis Meagher</a>, who had previously commented that the region should be protected. Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from <a href="Jay%20Cooke">Jay Cooke</a> to Ferdinand V. Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman <a href="William%20D.%20Kelley">William D. Kelley</a> had also suggested "<a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever".

In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">Ferdinand V. Hayden</a> was finally able to explore the region. With government sponsorship, he returned to the region with a second, larger expedition, the <a href="Hayden%20Geological%20Survey%20of%201871">Hayden Geological Survey of 1871</a>. He compiled a comprehensive report, including large-format photographs by <a href="William%20Henry%20Jackson">William Henry Jackson</a> and paintings by <a href="Thomas%20Moran">Thomas Moran</a>. The report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from <a href="public%20auction">public auction</a>. On March 1, 1872, President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> signed "The Act of Dedication" law that created Yellowstone National Park.

Hayden, while not the only person to have thought of creating a park in the region, was its first and most enthusiastic advocate. He believed in "setting aside the area as a pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people" and warned that there were those who would come and "make merchandise of these beautiful specimens". Worrying the area could face the same fate as <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, he concluded the site should "be as free as the air or Water." In his report to the Committee on Public Lands, he concluded that if the bill failed to become law, "the vandals who are now waiting to enter into this wonder-land, will in a single season despoil, beyond recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which have required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to prepare".

Hayden and his 1871 party recognized Yellowstone as a priceless treasure that would become rarer with time. He wished for others to see and experience it as well. Eventually the railroads and, some time after that, the automobile would make that possible. The Park was not set aside strictly for ecological purposes; however, the designation "pleasure ground" was not an invitation to create an amusement park. Hayden imagined something akin to the scenic resorts and baths in England, Germany, and Switzerland.

There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.

After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior <a href="Columbus%20Delano">Columbus Delano</a>, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel <a href="William%20Ludlow">William Ludlow</a>, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a>, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's "Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park". The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist <a href="George%20Bird%20Grinnell">George Bird Grinnell</a>.
Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides. "It is estimated that during the winter of 1874–1875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."

As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877.
Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand, <a href="Philetus%20Norris">Philetus Norris</a> volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities.

In 1880, <a href="Harry%20Yount">Harry Yount</a> was appointed as a gamekeeper to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Yount had previously spent decades exploring the mountain country of present-day Wyoming, including the <a href="Grand%20Tetons">Grand Tetons</a>, after joining <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">F V. Hayden</a>'s Geological Survey in 1873. Yount is the first national park ranger, and Yount's Peak, at the head of the Yellowstone River, was named in his honor. However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.
The <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Northern Pacific Railroad</a> built a train station in <a href="Livingston%2C%20Montana">Livingston, Montana</a>, connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. Visitors in these early years faced poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>. By 1908 visitation increased enough to attract a <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a> connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and ceased around the 1960s. Much of the railroad line was converted to nature trails, among them the Yellowstone Branch Line Trail.
During the 1870s and 1880s Native American tribes were effectively excluded from the national park. Under a half-dozen tribes had made seasonal use of the Yellowstone area, but the only year-round residents were small bands of <a href="Eastern%20Shoshone">Eastern Shoshone</a> known as "<a href="Sheepeaters">Sheepeaters</a>". They left the area under the assurances of a treaty negotiated in 1868, under which the Sheepeaters ceded their lands but retained the right to hunt in Yellowstone. The United States never ratified the treaty and refused to recognize the claims of the Sheepeaters or any other tribe that had used Yellowstone.

The <a href="Nez%20Perce%20%28tribe%29">Nez Perce</a> band associated with <a href="Chief%20Joseph">Chief Joseph</a>, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were being pursued by the U.S. Army and entered the national park about two weeks after the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Big%20Hole">Battle of the Big Hole</a>. Some of the Nez Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that no one should be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded. One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the <a href="Firehole%20River">Firehole River</a> to Mary Mountain and beyond. That stream is still known as Nez Perce Creek. A group of <a href="Bannock%20%28tribe%29">Bannocks</a> entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent <a href="Philetus%20Norris">Philetus Norris</a>. In the aftermath of the <a href="Sheepeater%20Indian%20War">Sheepeater Indian War</a> of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.

Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at <a href="Mammoth%20Hot%20Springs">Mammoth Hot Springs</a> in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed <a href="Fort%20Yellowstone">Fort Yellowstone</a>. On May 7, 1894, the <a href="Boone%20and%20Crockett%20Club">Boone and Crockett Club</a>, acting through the personality of George G. Vest, Arnold Hague, William Hallett Phillips, W. A. Wadsworth, Archibald Rogers, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and <a href="George%20Bird%20Grinnell">George Bird Grinnell</a> were successful in carrying through the Park Protection Act, which saved the Park. The Lacey Act of 1900 provided legal support for the officials prosecuting poachers. With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918.

In 1898, the naturalist <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> described the park as follows: "However orderly your excursions or aimless, again and again amid the calmest, stillest scenery you will be brought to a standstill hushed and awe-stricken before phenomena wholly new to you. Boiling springs and huge deep pools of purest green and azure water, thousands of them, are plashing and heaving in these high, cool mountains as if a fierce furnace fire were burning beneath each one of them; and a hundred geysers, white torrents of boiling water and steam, like inverted waterfalls, are ever and anon rushing up out of the hot, black underworld."

By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse-drawn transportation. Horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited.

The <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC), a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> relief agency for young men, played a major role between 1933 and 1942 in developing Yellowstone facilities. CCC projects included reforestation, campground development of many of the park's trails and campgrounds, trail construction, fire hazard reduction, and fire-fighting work. The CCC built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads.

During <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, tourist travel fell sharply, staffing was cut, and many facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented <a href="Mission%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B66">Mission 66</a>, an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.
The <a href="1959%20Hebgen%20Lake%20earthquake">1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake</a> just west of Yellowstone at <a href="Hebgen%20Lake">Hebgen Lake</a> damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.

In 1963, after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone, United States Secretary of the Interior <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the <a href="Leopold%20Report">Leopold Report</a>, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended management of Yellowstone's elk population.

The <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic re-evaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On "Black Saturday", August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than burned.

The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000 <a href="archeology">archeological</a> sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20Yellowstone%20National%20Park">historic structures</a> and features, and of these <a href="Obsidian%20Cliff">Obsidian Cliff</a> and five buildings have been designated <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmarks">National Historic Landmarks</a>. Yellowstone was designated an <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> on October 26, 1976, and a UN <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> on September 8, 1978. The park was placed on the <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20in%20Danger">List of World Heritage in Danger</a> from 1995 to 2003 due to the effects of tourism, infection of wildlife, and issues with <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. In 2010, Yellowstone National Park was honored with its own <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a> under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.

Justin Ferrell explores three moral sensibilities that motivated activists in dealing with Yellowstone. First came the utilitarian vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists in the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision that focuses on the health of the ecosystem as theorized by <a href="Aldo%20Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a>, which led to the expansion of federally protected areas and to the surrounding ecosystems.

The Heritage and Research Center is located at <a href="Gardiner%2C%20Montana">Gardiner, Montana</a>, near the north entrance to the park. The center is home to the Yellowstone National Park's museum collection, archives, research library, historian, archeology lab, and <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>. The Yellowstone National Park Archives maintain collections of historical records of Yellowstone and the National Park Service. The collection includes the administrative records of Yellowstone, as well as resource management records, records from major projects, and donated manuscripts and personal papers. The archives are affiliated with the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a>.

Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another three percent is within Montana, with the remaining one percent in Idaho. The park is north to south, and west to east by air. Yellowstone is in area, larger than the states of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> or <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at . Yellowstone Lake is up to deep and has of shoreline. At an elevation of above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is <a href="prairie">grassland</a>.

The <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a <a href="topography">topographic</a> feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>s are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.
The park sits on the <a href="Yellowstone%20Plateau">Yellowstone Plateau</a>, at an average elevation of above sea level. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>s of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Middle Rocky Mountains</a>, which range from in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop <a href="Eagle%20Peak%20%28Wyoming%29">Eagle Peak</a> () and the lowest is along Reese Creek (). Nearby mountain ranges include the <a href="Gallatin%20Range">Gallatin Range</a> to the northwest, the <a href="Beartooth%20Mountains">Beartooth Mountains</a> in the north, the <a href="Absaroka%20Range">Absaroka Range</a> to the east, the <a href="Teton%20Range">Teton Range</a> to the south, and the <a href="Madison%20Range">Madison Range</a> to the west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is <a href="Mount%20Washburn">Mount Washburn</a> at .

Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified forests</a>, trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris are believed to have come from the park area itself as the central part of Yellowstone is the massive caldera of a supervolcano. The park contains 290 <a href="waterfall">waterfall</a>s of at least , the highest being the <a href="Yellowstone%20Falls">Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River</a> at .

Three deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The <a href="Lewis%20River%20%28Wyoming%29">Lewis River</a> flows through <a href="Lewis%20Canyon">Lewis Canyon</a> in the south, and the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a> has carved two colorful canyons, the <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Yellowstone">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</a> and the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.

Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the <a href="Snake%20River%20Plain">Snake River Plain</a>, a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a> some to the west.

The volcanism of Yellowstone is believed to be linked to the somewhat older volcanism of Snake River plain. Yellowstone is thus the active part of a <a href="hotspot%20%28geology%29">hotspot</a> that has moved northeast over time. The origin of this hotspot volcanism is disputed. One theory holds that a <a href="mantle%20plume">mantle plume</a> has caused the <a href="Yellowstone%20hotspot">Yellowstone hotspot</a> to migrate northeast, while another theory explains migrating hotspot volcanism as the result of the fragmentation and dynamics of the <a href="subduction">subducted</a> <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> in Earth's interior.

The <a href="Yellowstone%20Caldera">Yellowstone Caldera</a> is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "<a href="supervolcano">supervolcano</a>" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a> that lies under Yellowstone is estimated to be a single connected chamber, about long, wide, and 3 to 7 miles (5 to 12 km) deep. The current <a href="caldera">caldera</a> was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released more than 240 cubic miles (1,000 km³) of ash, rock and <a href="pyroclast">pyroclast</a>ic materials. This eruption was more than 1,000 times larger than the <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens</a>. It produced a caldera nearly five eighths of a mile (1 km) deep and in area and deposited the <a href="Lava%20Creek%20Tuff">Lava Creek Tuff</a>, a <a href="welded%20tuff">welded tuff</a> <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a>. The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km³) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the <a href="Huckleberry%20Ridge%20Tuff">Huckleberry Ridge Tuff</a> and created the <a href="Island%20Park%20Caldera">Island Park Caldera</a>. A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km³) of material 1.3 million years ago, forming the <a href="Henry%27s%20Fork%20Caldera">Henry's Fork Caldera</a> and depositing the <a href="Mesa%20Falls%20Tuff">Mesa Falls Tuff</a>.

Each of the three climactic eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the <a href="extinction">extinction</a> of some species, primarily in North America.
A subsequent caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the <a href="West%20Thumb">West Thumb</a> of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000 years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of <a href="rhyolite">rhyolitic</a> lavas such as those that can be seen at <a href="Obsidian%20Cliff">Obsidian Cliff</a>s and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic lavas which can be viewed at <a href="Sheepeater%20Cliff">Sheepeater Cliff</a>. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic <a href="V-shaped%20valley">V-shaped valley</a>, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by <a href="glacier">glaciation</a>.

Each eruption is part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the partial collapse of the roof of the volcano's partially emptied magma chamber. This creates a collapsed depression, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 800,000 years, but the small number of such climactic eruptions cannot be used to make an accurate prediction for future volcanic events.

The most famous <a href="geyser">geyser</a> in the park, and perhaps the world, is <a href="Old%20Faithful">Old Faithful</a> geyser, located in <a href="Upper%20Geyser%20Basin">Upper Geyser Basin</a>. <a href="Castle%20Geyser">Castle Geyser</a>, <a href="Lion%20Geyser">Lion Geyser</a> and <a href="Beehive%20Geyser">Beehive Geyser</a> are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world—<a href="Steamboat%20Geyser">Steamboat Geyser</a> in the <a href="Norris%20Geyser%20Basin">Norris Geyser Basin</a>. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year. Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 thermal features altogether. Half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are concentrated in Yellowstone.
In May 2001, the <a href="U.S.%20Geological%20Survey">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, Yellowstone National Park, and the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region.

In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome— areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement— had risen at a rate of per year from mid–2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. However, these changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system.

Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> 6 or greater in historical times, including the 7.2‑magnitude <a href="1959%20Hebgen%20Lake%20earthquake">Hebgen Lake earthquake</a> which occurred just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge <a href="landslide">landslide</a>, which caused a partial dam collapse on <a href="Hebgen%20Lake">Hebgen Lake</a>; immediately downstream, the <a href="sediment">sediment</a> from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as <a href="Quake%20Lake">Earthquake Lake</a>. Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs that normally have clear water turned muddy. A 6.1‑magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal.

For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a>, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.

On March 30, 2014, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck almost the very middle of Yellowstone near the Norris Basin at 6:34 am; reports indicated no damage. This was the largest earthquake to hit the park since February 22, 1980.

Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes <a href="Grand%20Teton%20National%20Park">Grand Teton National Park</a>, adjacent <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forests</a> and expansive <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the contiguous United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. With the successful <a href="wolf%20reintroduction">wolf reintroduction</a> program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.

Over 1,700 <a href="species">species</a> of trees and other <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be <a href="exotic%20species">exotic species</a> and are non-native. Of the eight <a href="conifer">conifer</a> tree species documented, <a href="Lodgepole%20Pine">Lodgepole Pine</a> forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as <a href="Subalpine%20Fir">Subalpine Fir</a>, <a href="Engelmann%20Spruce">Engelmann Spruce</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20Douglas-fir">Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir</a> and <a href="Whitebark%20Pine">Whitebark Pine</a>, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as <a href="Cronartium%20ribicola">white pine blister rust</a>; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. <a href="Quaking%20Aspen">Quaking Aspen</a> and <a href="willow">willow</a>s are the most common species of <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the <a href="History%20of%20wolves%20in%20Yellowstone">reintroduction of wolves</a> which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.
There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. The <a href="Abronia%20ammophila">Yellowstone sand verbena</a> is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline.

In Yellowstone's hot waters, bacteria form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>. In 2005 researchers from the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse <a href="Hyperthermophile">hyperthermophilic</a> species is <a href="hydrogen">molecular hydrogen</a>.

"<a href="Thermus%20aquaticus">Thermus aquaticus</a>" is a <a href="Bacteria">bacterium</a> found in the Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating <a href="DNA">DNA</a> as part of the <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, <a href="Hadesarchaea">Hadesarchaea</a>, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.

Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive.

Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> wildlife habitat in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">lower 48 states</a>. There are almost 60 species of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s in the park, including the <a href="northwestern%20wolf">timber wolf</a>, <a href="Mountain%20coyote">coyote</a>, the <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canadian lynx</a>, and <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s. Other large mammals include the <a href="American%20bison">bison</a> (often referred to as buffalo), <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20elk">elk</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a>, <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a>, <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, and <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>.
The <a href="Yellowstone%20Park%20bison%20herd">Yellowstone Park bison herd</a> is the largest public herd of <a href="American%20bison">American bison</a> in the United States. The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit <a href="bovine">bovine</a> diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, a bacterial disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause cattle to <a href="miscarriage">miscarry</a>. The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the <a href="Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</a> (APHIS) has stated that bison are the "likely source" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>. Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The Yellowstone Park bison herd reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the <a href="Henry%20Mountains%20bison%20herd">Henry Mountains bison herd</a> of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, at <a href="Wind%20Cave%20National%20Park">Wind Cave National Park</a> in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> and in <a href="Elk%20Island%20National%20Park">Elk Island National Park</a> in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>.
To combat the perceived threat of <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a> transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. <a href="Animal%20rights">Animal rights</a> activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.
Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of "destroying wolves, <a href="prairie%20dog">prairie dog</a>s, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry" on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the <a href="coyote">coyote</a> then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.

By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.
<a href="American%20black%20bear">Black bears</a> are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.

, an estimated 700 grizzly bears were living in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with about 150 grizzlies living wholly or partially within Yellowstone National Park. The grizzly was initially listed as a threatened species in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a> on July 28, 1975 by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The grizzly bear was taken off the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service%20list%20of%20endangered%20mammals%20and%20birds">endangered species list</a> in 2007. Opponents of delisting the grizzly expressed concerns that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures were needed to ensure a sustainable population. A federal district judge overturned the delisting ruling in 2009, reinstating the grizzly; however, the grizzly was once again removed from the list in 2017. In September 2018, a US district judge ruled that the grizzly's protections must be restored in full, arguing the Fish and Wildlife Service was mistaken in removing the bear from the threatened status list. Regardless of the rulings, hunting is prohibited within Yellowstone National Park. Hunters who legally hunt animals outside park boundaries may transport the carcass through the park with a permit.
Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000—the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid‑1990s; this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the <a href="National%20Elk%20Refuge">National Elk Refuge</a>, immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.
In 2003 the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over . Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though <a href="DNA">DNA</a> taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>. The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.

Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a>—a fish highly sought by <a href="fishing">anglers</a>. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of <a href="lake%20trout">lake trout</a>, an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. Although lake trout were established in <a href="Shoshone%20Lake">Shoshone</a> and <a href="Lewis%20Lake%20%28Wyoming%29">Lewis</a> lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite—<a href="Myxobolus%20cerebralis">whirling disease</a>—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of <a href="reptiles">reptiles</a>, such as the <a href="painted%20turtle">painted turtle</a> and <a href="Crotalus%20viridis">Prairie rattlesnake</a>, and four species of <a href="amphibians">amphibians</a>, including the <a href="Boreal%20Chorus%20Frog">Boreal Chorus Frog</a>.

311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. In 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles were documented. Extremely rare sightings of <a href="whooping%20crane">whooping crane</a>s have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a>, <a href="harlequin%20duck">harlequin duck</a>, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> and the <a href="trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter swan</a>.

As <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a> is a natural part of most ecosystems, plants that are <a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">indigenous</a> to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. <a href="Lodgepole%20Pine">Lodgepole Pine</a>s —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. <a href="Subalpine%20Fir">Subalpine Fir</a>, <a href="Engelmann%20Spruce">Engelmann Spruce</a>, <a href="Whitebark%20Pine">Whitebark Pine</a>, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. <a href="Populus%20tremuloides">Aspen</a> trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.

About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by <a href="lightning">lightning</a>, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three <a href="fire%20lookout">fire lookout towers</a>, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than , and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.
In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. <a href="Controlled%20burn">Controlled burn</a>s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.
1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.

Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.

Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year-round. The record high temperature was in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is in 1933. During the summer months of June to early September, daytime highs are normally in the range, while night time lows can go to below freezing (0 °C) especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>s. Spring and fall temperatures range between with nights in the teens to single digits (−5 to −20 °C). Winter in Yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between zero and 20 °F (−20 to −5 °C) and nighttime temperatures below 0  °F (−18 °C) for most of the winter.

Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the <a href="Snake%20River%20Plain">Snake River Plain</a> to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, but most common between November and April, with averages of annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations.

<a href="Tornado">Tornado</a>es in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the <a href="Teton%20Wilderness">Teton Wilderness</a> of <a href="Bridger-Teton%20National%20Forest">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a> and hit Yellowstone National Park. Called the <a href="Teton%E2%80%93Yellowstone%20tornado">Teton–Yellowstone tornado</a>, it was classified as an <a href="Fujita%20Scale">F4</a>, with wind speeds estimated at between . The tornado left a path of destruction wide, and long, and leveled of mature pine forest.

The climate at Yellowstone Lake is classified as <a href="Subarctic%20climate">subarctic</a> (Dfc), according to <a href="K%C3%B6ppen-Geiger%20climate%20classification%20system">Köppen-Geiger climate classification</a>, while at the park headquarters the classification is <a href="Humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental</a> (Dfb).

Yellowstone ranks among the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. Average annual visitation increased to 3.5 million during the ten-year period from 2007 to 2016, with a record of 4,257,177 recreational visitors in 2016. July is the busiest month for Yellowstone National Park. At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.

Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from <a href="Gardiner%2C%20Montana">Gardiner, Montana</a>, and extends to <a href="Cooke%20City%2C%20Montana">Cooke City, Montana</a>, are closed to wheeled vehicles. Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. The park has of paved roads which can be accessed from five different entrances. There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> and <a href="snow%20coach">snow coach</a> tours, though their numbers and access are based on quotas established by the National Park Service. Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.
The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the <a href="Old%20Faithful%20Inn">Old Faithful Inn</a> built from 1903 to 1904 and the entire <a href="Fort%20Yellowstone">Fort Yellowstone – Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District</a>. An historical and educational tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.

<a href="Camping">Camping</a> is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south. <a href="Backcountry">Backcountry</a> campsites are accessible only by foot or by <a href="horseback%20riding">horseback</a> and require a permit. There are of hiking trails available. The park is not considered to be a good destination for <a href="mountaineering">mountaineering</a> because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in "frontcountry" zones such as drive in campgrounds. Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year-round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year.

Hunting is not permitted, though it is allowed in the surrounding national forests during open season. Fishing is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters. Many park waters are <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a> only and all native fish species are <a href="catch%20and%20release">catch and release</a> only. Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and <a href="Shoshone%20Lake">Shoshone Lake</a>, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination.
In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.

The entire park is within the jurisdiction of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Wyoming">United States District Court for the District of Wyoming</a>, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor <a href="Brian%20C.%20Kalt">Brian C. Kalt</a> has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the <a href="Vicinage%20Clause">Vicinage Clause</a> of the <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixth Amendment</a> for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that it would be difficult to do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.

Zinc

Zinc is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element in <a href="group%2012%20element">group 12</a> of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn and Mg <a href="ion">ion</a>s are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">element in Earth's crust</a> and has five stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. The most common zinc <a href="ore">ore</a> is <a href="sphalerite">sphalerite</a> (zinc blende), a <a href="zinc%20sulfide">zinc sulfide</a> mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by <a href="froth%20flotation">froth flotation</a> of the <a href="ore">ore</a>, <a href="Roasting%20%28metallurgy%29">roasting</a>, and final <a href="extractive%20metallurgy">extraction</a> using <a href="electricity">electricity</a> (<a href="electrowinning">electrowinning</a>).

<a href="Brass">Brass</a>, an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> of <a href="copper">copper</a> and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Kalmykia">Kalmykia</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, and the second millennium BC in <a href="West%20India">West India</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, Iraq, and Israel/Palestine. Zinc <a href="metal">metal</a> was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. <a href="alchemy">Alchemists</a> burned zinc in air to form what they called "<a href="philosopher%27s%20wool">philosopher's wool</a>" or "white snow".

The element was probably named by the alchemist <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a> after the German word "Zinke" (prong, tooth). German chemist <a href="Andreas%20Sigismund%20Marggraf">Andreas Sigismund Marggraf</a> is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by <a href="Luigi%20Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a> and <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a> uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. <a href="Corrosion">Corrosion</a>-resistant <a href="galvanization">zinc plating</a> of iron (<a href="hot-dip%20galvanizing">hot-dip galvanizing</a>) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical <a href="Zinc%E2%80%93carbon%20battery">batteries</a>, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as <a href="brass">brass</a>. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as <a href="zinc%20carbonate">zinc carbonate</a> and <a href="zinc%20gluconate">zinc gluconate</a> (as dietary supplements), <a href="zinc%20chloride">zinc chloride</a> (in deodorants), <a href="zinc%20pyrithione">zinc pyrithione</a> (anti-<a href="dandruff">dandruff</a> shampoos), <a href="zinc%20sulfide">zinc sulfide</a> (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or <a href="diethylzinc">diethylzinc</a> in the organic laboratory.

Zinc is an <a href="micronutrient">essential mineral</a>, including to prenatal and postnatal development. <a href="Zinc%20deficiency">Zinc deficiency</a> affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. <a href="Enzyme">Enzyme</a>s with a zinc atom in the <a href="prosthetic%20groups">reactive center</a> are widespread in biochemistry, such as <a href="alcohol%20dehydrogenase">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> in humans.

Consumption of excess zinc may cause <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>, <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a>, and <a href="copper%20deficiency">copper deficiency</a>.

Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than <a href="iron">iron</a> and has a hexagonal <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a>, with a distorted form of <a href="Close-packing%20of%20equal%20spheres">hexagonal close packing</a>, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C. Above 210 °C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair <a href="electrical%20conductivity">conductor of electricity</a>. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C) and boiling points (907 °C). The melting point is the lowest of all the <a href="d-block">d-block</a> metals aside from <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often not considered to be <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s like the rest of the d-block metals are.

Many <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s contain zinc, including brass. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a>, and <a href="sodium">sodium</a>. Although neither zinc nor <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a> are <a href="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a>, their alloy exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>.

A bar of zinc generates a characteristic sound when bent, similar to <a href="tin%20cry">tin cry</a>.

Zinc makes up about 75 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> (0.0075%) of <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>, making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains zinc in 5–770 ppm with an average 64 ppm. <a href="Seawater">Seawater</a> has only 30 <a href="Parts%20per%20billion">ppb</a> and the atmosphere, 0.1–4 µg/m. The element is normally found in association with other <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a>s such as <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a> in <a href="ore">ore</a>s. Zinc is a <a href="Goldschmidt%20classification%23Chalcophile%20elements">chalcophile</a>, meaning the element is more likely to be found in minerals together with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and other heavy <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>s, rather than with the light chalcogen <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> or with non-chalcogen electronegative elements such as the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s. <a href="Sulfide">Sulfide</a>s formed as the crust solidified under the <a href="redox">reducing</a> conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. <a href="Sphalerite">Sphalerite</a>, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.

Other source minerals for zinc include <a href="smithsonite">smithsonite</a> (zinc <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>), <a href="hemimorphite">hemimorphite</a> (zinc <a href="silicate">silicate</a>), <a href="wurtzite">wurtzite</a> (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes <a href="hydrozincite">hydrozincite</a> (basic <a href="zinc%20carbonate">zinc carbonate</a>). With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.

Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9–2.8 billion <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, with the largest reserves in <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) at the time of determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.

Five stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of zinc occur in nature, with Zn being the most abundant isotope (49.17% <a href="natural%20abundance">natural abundance</a>). The other isotopes found in nature are (27.73%), (4.04%), (18.45%), and (0.61%). The most abundant isotope Zn and the rare Zn are theoretically unstable on energetic grounds, though their predicted half-lives exceed and , meaning that their radioactivity could be ignored for practical purposes.

Several dozen <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have been characterized. , which has a half-life of 243.66 days, is the least active radioisotope, followed by with a half-life of 46.5 hours. Zinc has 10 <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s. Zn has the longest half-life, 13.76 h. The superscript "m" indicates a <a href="metastable">metastable</a> isotope. The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an <a href="excited%20state">excited state</a> and will return to the <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a> by emitting a <a href="photon">photon</a> in the form of a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>. has three excited metastable states and has two. The isotopes , , and each have only one excited metastable state.

The most common <a href="decay%20mode">decay mode</a> of a <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a> of zinc with a <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> lower than 66 is <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>. The <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a> resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper.

The most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with mass number higher than 66 is <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> (β), which produces an isotope of <a href="gallium">gallium</a>.

Zinc has an <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> of [Ar]3d4s and is a member of the <a href="group%2012%20element">group 12</a> of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a>. The surface of the pure metal <a href="tarnish">tarnish</a>es quickly, eventually forming a protective <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivating</a> layer of the basic <a href="Hydrozincite">zinc carbonate</a>, , by reaction with atmospheric <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.

Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of <a href="zinc%20oxide">zinc oxide</a>. Zinc reacts readily with <a href="acid">acid</a>s, <a href="alkali">alkali</a>s and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a> with acids. Strong acids, such as <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric</a> or <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.

The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed, the outer <a href="electron%20shell">shell</a> "s" electrons are lost, yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, is the predominant species. The <a href="volatilization">volatilization</a> of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 °C indicates the formation of , a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.

Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, <a href="nickel">nickel</a> and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> and mostly colorless. The <a href="ionic%20radii">ionic radii</a> of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a>, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of <a href="covalency">covalency</a> and much more stable <a href="Complex%20%28chemistry%29">complexes</a> with <a href="nitrogen">N</a>- and <a href="sulfur">S</a>- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- <a href="coordinate%20covalent%20bond">coordinate</a> although 5-coordinate complexes are known.

Zinc(I) compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the [Zn] core, which is analogous to the [Hg] dimeric cation present in <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>(I) compounds. The <a href="diamagnetism">diamagnetic</a> nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn–Zn bond, <a href="Decamethyldizincocene">(η-CMe)Zn</a>, is also the first <a href="metallocene">dimetallocene</a>. The [Zn] ion rapidly <a href="disproportionation">disproportionates</a> into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has been obtained only a yellow glass only by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl.

<a href="Binary%20compound">Binary compound</a>s of zinc are known for most of the <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>s and all the <a href="nonmetal">nonmetal</a>s except the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es. The oxide <a href="zinc%20oxide">ZnO</a> is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is <a href="amphoteric">amphoteric</a>, dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions. The other <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>ides (<a href="zinc%20sulfide">ZnS</a>, <a href="zinc%20selenide">ZnSe</a>, and <a href="zinc%20telluride">ZnTe</a>) have varied applications in electronics and optics. <a href="Pnictogenide">Pnictogenide</a>s (<a href="Zinc%20nitride"></a>, <a href="zinc%20phosphide"></a>, <a href="zinc%20arsenide"></a> and <a href="zinc%20antimonide"></a>), the peroxide (<a href="zinc%20peroxide"></a>), the hydride (<a href="zinc%20hydride"></a>), and the carbide () are also known. Of the four <a href="halide">halide</a>s, <a href="zinc%20fluoride"></a> has the most ionic character, while the others (<a href="zinc%20chloride"></a>, <a href="zinc%20bromide"></a>, and <a href="zinc%20iodide"></a>) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character.

In weak basic solutions containing ions, the hydroxide <a href="Zinc%20hydroxide"></a> forms as a white <a href="precipitate">precipitate</a>. In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates (<a href="zincate"></a>). The nitrate <a href="Zinc%20nitrate"></a>, chlorate <a href="Zinc%20chlorate"></a>, sulfate <a href="Zinc%20sulfate"></a>, phosphate <a href="Zinc%20phosphate"></a>, molybdate <a href="Zinc%20molybdate"></a>, cyanide <a href="Zinc%20cyanide"></a>, arsenite , arsenate and the chromate <a href="Zinc%20chromate"></a> (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. One of the simplest examples of an <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a> of zinc is the acetate (<a href="Zinc%20acetate"></a>).

<a href="Organozinc%20compound">Organozinc compound</a>s are those that contain zinc–carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc (<a href="Diethylzinc"></a>) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and <a href="ethyl%20iodide">ethyl iodide</a>, and was the first compound known to contain a metal–carbon <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>.

Cobalticyanide paper (Rinnmann's test for Zn) can be used as a chemical indicator for zinc. 4 g of KCo(CN) and 1 g of KClO is dissolved on 100 ml of water. Paper is dipped in the solution and dried at 100 °C. One drop of the sample is dropped onto the dry paper and heated. A green disc indicates the presence of zinc.

Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. Zinc ores were used to make the zinc–copper alloy <a href="brass">brass</a> thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23% zinc.

Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> by the 7th century BC, but few varieties were made. Ornaments made of <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s containing 80–90% zinc, with lead, iron, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, and other metals making up the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years old. A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a <a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>n archaeological site.

The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship <a href="Relitto%20del%20Pozzino">Relitto del Pozzino</a>, wrecked in 140 BC.

The manufacture of brass was known to the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> by about 30 BC. They made brass by heating powdered <a href="Calamine%20%28mineral%29">calamine</a> (zinc <a href="silicate">silicate</a> or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting <a href="calamine%20brass">calamine brass</a> was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass.

<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>) mentions "drops of false silver" which when mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by-product of smelting <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a> ores. Zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless.

The <a href="Berne%20zinc%20tablet">Berne zinc tablet</a> is a votive plaque dating to <a href="Roman%20Gaul">Roman Gaul</a> made of an alloy that is mostly zinc.

The <a href="Charaka%20Samhita">Charaka Samhita</a>, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces "pushpanjan", thought to be zinc oxide. Zinc mines at Zawar, near <a href="Udaipur">Udaipur</a> in India, have been active since the <a href="Mauryan%20period">Mauryan period</a> ( and 187 BCE). The smelting of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The <a href="Rasaratna%20Samuccaya">Rasaratna Samuccaya</a>, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes.

Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of "Yasada" or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.
<a href="Alchemy">Alchemists</a> burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a <a href="Condenser%20%28heat%20transfer%29">condenser</a>. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide "lana philosophica", Latin for "philosopher's wool", because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it "nix album".

The name of the metal was probably first documented by <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as "zincum" or "zinken" in his book "Liber Mineralium II", in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German , and supposedly meant "tooth-like, pointed or jagged" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). "Zink" could also imply "tin-like" because of its relation to German "zinn" meaning tin. Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> word "seng" meaning stone. The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego, calamine, and spinter.

German metallurgist <a href="Andreas%20Libavius">Andreas Libavius</a> received a quantity of what he called "calay" of Malabar from a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596. Libavius described the properties of the sample, which may have been zinc. Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries, but was at times very expensive.

Metallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD, much earlier than in the West. Before it was isolated in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE. <a href="Postlewayt">Postlewayt's</a> "Universal Dictionary", a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.

Flemish <a href="metallurgist">metallurgist</a> and <a href="alchemist">alchemist</a> <a href="P.%20M.%20de%20Respour">P. M. de Respour</a> reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Geoffroy">Étienne François Geoffroy</a> described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, <a href="John%20Lane%20%28metallurgist%29">John Lane</a> is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at <a href="Landore">Landore</a>, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.

In 1738 in Great Britain, <a href="William%20Champion%20%28metallurgist%29">William Champion</a> patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical <a href="retort">retort</a> style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.

German chemist <a href="Andreas%20Sigismund%20Marggraf">Andreas Marggraf</a> normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously. In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.

William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for <a href="calcining">calcining</a> zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, <a href="Johann%20Christian%20Ruberg">Johann Christian Ruberg</a> improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Daniel%20Dony">Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony</a> built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc.

Italian doctor <a href="Luigi%20Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a> discovered in 1780 that connecting the <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create <a href="electricity">electricity</a> and called the effect "<a href="bioelectricity">animal electricity</a>". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for <a href="Battery%20%28electricity%29">electrical batteries</a>, galvanization, and <a href="cathodic%20protection">cathodic protection</a>.

Galvani's friend, <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>, continued researching the effect and invented the <a href="Voltaic%20pile">Voltaic pile</a> in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified <a href="galvanic%20cell">galvanic cell</a>, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> and connected by a conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing <a href="electron">electron</a>s from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.

The non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a>, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its <a href="active%20site">active site</a>. The digestive enzyme <a href="carboxypeptidase">carboxypeptidase</a> became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.

Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, and <a href="copper">copper</a> with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes. The world's largest zinc producer is <a href="Nyrstar">Nyrstar</a>, a merger of the Australian <a href="OZ%20Minerals">OZ Minerals</a> and the Belgian <a href="Umicore">Umicore</a>. About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc. Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated "SHG", and is 99.995% pure.

Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from <a href="sulfide">sulfidic</a> ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.

Zinc metal is produced using <a href="extractive%20metallurgy">extractive metallurgy</a>. The ore is finely ground, then put through <a href="froth%20flotation">froth flotation</a> to separate minerals from <a href="gangue">gangue</a> (on the property of <a href="hydrophobicity">hydrophobicity</a>), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% .

<a href="Roasting%20%28metallurgy%29">Roasting</a> converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide:

The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc spinel (like the <a href="Skorpion%20Zinc">Skorpion Deposit</a> in Namibia) are used for zinc production, the roasting can be omitted.

For further processing two basic methods are used: <a href="pyrometallurgy">pyrometallurgy</a> or <a href="electrowinning">electrowinning</a>. Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with <a href="carbon">carbon</a> or <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> at into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those temperatures. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. The equations below describe this process:

In <a href="electrowinning">electrowinning</a>, zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>:

Finally, the zinc is reduced by <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>.

The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step.

When galvanised feedstock is fed to an <a href="electric%20arc%20furnace">electric arc furnace</a>, the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominately the <a href="Waelz%20process">Waelz process</a> (90% as of 2014).

Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> vapor. Smelter <a href="slag">slag</a> and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of <a href="Kelmis">La Calamine</a> and <a href="Plombi%C3%A8res">Plombières</a> between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the <a href="Geul%20River">Geul River</a> contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1.

Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm. Effective <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a> greatly reduces this; treatment along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.

<a href="soil%20contamination">Soils contaminated</a> with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other <a href="Dietary%20mineral">essential metals</a>, such as iron and <a href="manganese">manganese</a>. Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.

Major applications of zinc include (numbers are given for the US)

Zinc is most commonly used as an anti-<a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> agent, and galvanization (coating of <a href="iron">iron</a> or <a href="steel">steel</a>) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893,000 tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.

Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by <a href="hot-dip%20galvanizing">hot-dip galvanizing</a> or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.

The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient <a href="sacrificial%20anode">sacrificial anode</a> in <a href="cathodic%20protection">cathodic protection</a> (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the <a href="anode">anode</a> (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.

With a <a href="standard%20electrode%20potential">standard electrode potential</a> (SEP) of −0.76 <a href="volt">volt</a>s, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in <a href="Lithium%20battery">lithium batteries</a> ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in <a href="alkaline%20battery">alkaline batteries</a> and the case (which also serves as the anode) of <a href="Zinc-carbon%20battery">zinc–carbon batteries</a> is formed from sheet zinc. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the <a href="zinc-air%20battery">zinc-air battery</a>/fuel cell. The <a href="Zinc%E2%80%93cerium%20battery">zinc-cerium</a> <a href="redox%20flow%20battery">redox flow battery</a> also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell.

A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more <a href="ductile">ductile</a> and stronger than copper, and has superior <a href="corrosion%20resistance">corrosion resistance</a>. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.
Other widely used zinc alloys include <a href="nickel%20silver">nickel silver</a>, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium <a href="solder">solder</a>, and commercial <a href="bronze">bronze</a>. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in <a href="Lincoln%20cent">American one cent coins</a> (pennies) since 1982. The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.

Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in <a href="die%20casting">die casting</a> as well as <a href="spin%20casting">spin casting</a>, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name <a href="Zamak">Zamak</a>. An example of this is <a href="zinc%20aluminium">zinc aluminium</a>. The low melting point together with the low <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This <a href="superplasticity">superplasticity</a> of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.

Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> formed by <a href="deep%20drawing">deep drawing</a>, <a href="roll%20forming">roll forming</a>, or <a href="bending%20%28metalworking%29">bending</a>, zinc alloys with <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.

As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a <a href="lead">lead</a> replacement. In the wake of <a href="Lead%20poisoning">lead concerns</a>, zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to <a href="tire%20balance">tire balance</a>s and flywheels.

<a href="Cadmium%20zinc%20telluride">Cadmium zinc telluride</a> (CZT) is a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductive</a> alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a> and can detect the energy of incoming <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.

Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> in the manufacture of rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from <a href="ultraviolet%20radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> (UV). The <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> properties of zinc oxide make it useful in <a href="varistor">varistor</a>s and photocopying products. The <a href="zinc%20zinc-oxide%20cycle">zinc zinc-oxide cycle</a> is a two step <a href="Thermochemistry">thermochemical</a> process based on zinc and zinc oxide for <a href="hydrogen%20production">hydrogen production</a>.

<a href="Zinc%20chloride">Zinc chloride</a> is often added to lumber as a <a href="fire%20retardant">fire retardant</a> and sometimes as a wood <a href="preservative">preservative</a>. It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. <a href="Zinc%20methyl">Zinc methyl</a> () is used in a number of organic <a href="organic%20synthesis">syntheses</a>. <a href="Zinc%20sulfide">Zinc sulfide</a> (ZnS) is used in <a href="luminescence">luminescent</a> pigments such as on the hands of clocks, <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> and television screens, and <a href="luminous%20paint">luminous paint</a>s. Crystals of ZnS are used in <a href="laser">laser</a>s that operate in the mid-<a href="infrared">infrared</a> part of the spectrum. <a href="Zinc%20sulfate">Zinc sulfate</a> is a chemical in <a href="dye">dye</a>s and pigments. <a href="Zinc%20pyrithione">Zinc pyrithione</a> is used in <a href="antifouling">antifouling</a> paints.

Zinc powder is sometimes used as a <a href="propellant">propellant</a> in <a href="model%20rocket">model rocket</a>s. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.

Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc <a href="bar%20%28counter%29">bars</a>.

, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to <a href="neutron%20activation">neutron activation</a>, being <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmuted</a> into the highly radioactive , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma radiation</a>. Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of before use, this is called <a href="depleted%20zinc%20oxide">depleted zinc oxide</a>. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a <a href="Salted%20bomb">salting</a> material for <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s (<a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of <a href="Isotope%20separation">isotopically enriched</a> would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's <a href="Nuclear%20fallout">fallout</a>. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.

Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural <a href="fungicide">fungicide</a>s; these include <a href="Zineb">Zineb</a>, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. Zinc in the form of <a href="Zinc%20dithiophosphate">ZDDP</a>, is used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.

<a href="Organozinc%20compound">Organozinc</a> chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon-zinc bonds, describing the physical properties, synthesis, and chemical reactions.Many organozinc compounds are important. Among important applications are

Zinc has found many applications as catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes. The results (yield and <a href="Enantiomeric%20excess">ee</a>) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice.

In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and <a href="Dietary%20mineral">mineral</a> supplements, zinc is included in such forms as <a href="zinc%20oxide">zinc oxide</a>, <a href="zinc%20acetate">zinc acetate</a>, or <a href="zinc%20gluconate">zinc gluconate</a>. Zinc is generally considered to be an antioxidant. However, it is redox inert and thus can serve such a function only indirectly. Generally, zinc supplement is recommended where there is high risk of zinc deficiency (such as low and middle income countries) as a preventive measure.

Zinc deficiency has been associated with <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a> (MDD), and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment.

Zinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months.

A Cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely to progress to <a href="age-related%20macular%20degeneration">age-related macular degeneration</a>.

Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for <a href="acrodermatitis%20enteropathica">acrodermatitis enteropathica</a>, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants.

<a href="Gastroenteritis">Gastroenteritis</a> is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the <a href="gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all <a href="granulocyte">granulocyte</a>s secrete zinc), or both.

In 2011, researchers reported that adding large amounts of zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.

Zinc is a negative allosteric modulator of the <a href="GABAA%20receptor">GABA receptor</a>.

<a href="Topical%20administration">Topical preparations</a> of zinc include those used on the skin, often in the form of <a href="zinc%20oxide">zinc oxide</a>. Zinc preparations can protect against <a href="sunburn">sunburn</a> in the summer and <a href="windburn">windburn</a> in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (<a href="perineum">perineum</a>) with each diaper change, it can protect against <a href="diaper%20rash">diaper rash</a>.

Chelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent <a href="halitosis">bad breath</a>.

<a href="Zinc%20pyrithione">Zinc pyrithione</a> is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff.

Zinc is an essential <a href="trace%20element">trace element</a> for humans and other animals, for plants and for <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s. Zinc is required for the function of over 300 <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s and 1000 <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s, and is stored and transferred in <a href="metallothionein">metallothionein</a>s. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all <a href="Enzyme%23Naming%20conventions">enzyme classes</a>.

In proteins, zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of <a href="Aspartic%20acid%20%28data%20page%29">aspartic acid</a>, <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a>, <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a> and <a href="histidine">histidine</a>. The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of other transition metals) is difficult.

Roughly  grams of zinc are distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye. <a href="Semen">Semen</a> is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in <a href="prostate%20gland">prostate gland</a> function and <a href="reproductive%20organ">reproductive organ</a> growth.

Zinc homeostasis of the body is mainly controlled by the intestine. Here, <a href="SLC39A4">ZIP4</a> and especially <a href="TRPM7">TRPM7</a> were linked to intestinal zinc uptake essential for postnatal survival.

In humans, the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous. It interacts with "a wide range of organic <a href="ligand">ligand</a>s", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a>, and <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. It also regulates <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc; a similar "<a href="in%20silico">in silico</a>" study in the plant "Arabidopsis thaliana" found 2367 zinc-related proteins.

In the <a href="brain">brain</a>, zinc is stored in specific <a href="synaptic%20vesicles">synaptic vesicles</a> by <a href="glutamatergic">glutamatergic</a> <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s and can modulate neuronal excitability. It plays a key role in <a href="synaptic%20plasticity">synaptic plasticity</a> and so in learning. Zinc <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a> also plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>. Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce <a href="neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</a> through mitochondrial oxidative stress (e.g., by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>, including <a href="complex%20I">complex I</a>, <a href="complex%20III">complex III</a>, and <a href="%CE%B1-ketoglutarate%20dehydrogenase">α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase</a>), the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal <a href="excitotoxicity">excitotoxicity</a>, and interference with intraneuronal <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a>. L- and D-histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake. <a href="SLC30A3">SLC30A3</a> is the primary <a href="Solute%20carrier%20family%23Solute%20carrier%20family%2030">zinc transporter</a> involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis.

Zinc is an efficient <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>, making it a useful catalytic agent in <a href="hydroxylation">hydroxylation</a> and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible <a href="coordination%20geometry">coordination geometry</a>, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift <a href="protein%20structure">conformations</a> to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a> and <a href="carboxypeptidase">carboxypeptidase</a>, which are vital to the processes of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> () regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.

In vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into for exhalation through the lungs. Without this enzyme, this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood <a href="pH">pH</a> of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more. The non-related β-carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> (auxin) and <a href="alcoholic%20fermentation">alcoholic fermentation</a>.

Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A <a href="coordinate%20covalent%20bond">coordinate covalent bond</a> is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.

Zinc has been recognized as a messenger, able to activate signalling pathways. Many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth. They can be targeted through <a href="Zinc%20transporter%20protein">ZIP transporters</a>.

Zinc serves a purely structural role in <a href="zinc%20finger">zinc finger</a>s, twists and clusters. Zinc fingers form parts of some <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s, which are proteins that recognize <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA base sequences</a> during the replication and transcription of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. Each of the nine or ten ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger's structure by coordinately binding to four <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s in the transcription factor. The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence.

In <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a>, zinc is bound to and transported by <a href="albumin">albumin</a> (60%, low-affinity) and <a href="transferrin">transferrin</a> (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use <a href="Cell%20signaling">zinc signaling</a> to communicate with other cells.

Zinc may be held in <a href="metallothionein">metallothionein</a> reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15–40%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.

The human <a href="dopamine%20transporter">dopamine transporter</a> contains a <a href="affinity%20%28pharmacology%29">high affinity</a> extracellular zinc <a href="binding%20site">binding site</a> which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine <a href="reuptake">reuptake</a> and amplifies <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>-induced <a href="neurotransmitter%20efflux">dopamine efflux</a> "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>". The human <a href="serotonin%20transporter">serotonin transporter</a> and <a href="norepinephrine%20transporter">norepinephrine transporter</a> do not contain zinc binding sites. Some <a href="EF%20hand">EF-hand</a> <a href="Calcium-binding%20protein">calcium binding proteins</a> such as <a href="S100%20protein">S100</a> or <a href="Neuronal%20calcium%20sensor-1">NCS-1</a> are also able to bind zinc ions.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4 mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11 mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets <a href="Tolerable%20upper%20intake%20level">Tolerable upper intake level</a>s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40 mg/day (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as <a href="Dietary%20Reference%20Intake">Dietary Reference Intake</a>s (DRIs).

The <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the <a href="phytate">phytate</a> content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25 mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For zinc labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 15 mg, but on May 27, 2016 it was revised to 11 mg. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at <a href="Reference%20Daily%20Intake">Reference Daily Intake</a>. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.

Animal products such as meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, and dairy contain zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds, including <a href="sesame">sesame</a>, <a href="poppy">poppy</a>, <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a>, <a href="celery">celery</a>, and <a href="Mustard%20%28condiment%29">mustard</a>. Zinc is also found in <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="nut%20%28fruit%29">nuts</a>, <a href="almond">almond</a>s, <a href="whole%20grain">whole grain</a>s, <a href="pumpkin%20seed">pumpkin seed</a>s, <a href="sunflower%20seed">sunflower seed</a>s, and <a href="blackcurrant">blackcurrant</a>. Plant <a href="phytate">phytate</a>s are particularly found in pulses and cereals and interfere with zinc absorption.

Other sources include <a href="food%20fortification">fortified food</a> and <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a>s in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.

Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc. Groups at risk include children in developing countries and elderly with chronic illnesses. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many in the developing world have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients. While zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, it can be associated with <a href="malabsorption">malabsorption</a>, <a href="acrodermatitis%20enteropathica">acrodermatitis enteropathica</a>, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses.

In the United States, a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2 mg/day, respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with age. The most recent published update of the survey (NHANES 2013–2014) reported lower averages – 9.3 and 13.2 mg/day – again with intake decreasing with age.

Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse. Clinical outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, <a href="alopecia">alopecia</a>, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired immune functions, defects in carbohydrate utilization, and reproductive <a href="teratogenesis">teratogenesis</a>. Zinc deficiency depresses immunity, but excessive zinc does also.

Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, <a href="phytates">phytates</a> in many whole-grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc <a href="chelation">chelator</a> <a href="phytic%20acid">phytate</a>, found in seeds and <a href="cereal">cereal</a> <a href="bran">bran</a>, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (8 mg/day for adult women; 11 mg/day for adult men) may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. The <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> (EFSA) guidelines attempt to compensate for this by recommending higher zinc intake when dietary phytate intake is greater. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc <a href="biomarker">biomarker</a>s, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor <a href="sensitivity%20and%20specificity">sensitivity and specificity</a>.

Species of "<a href="Calluna">Calluna</a>", "<a href="Erica">Erica</a>" and "<a href="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a>" can grow in zinc metalliferous soils, because translocation of toxic ions is prevented by the action of <a href="Ericoid%20mycorrhiza">ericoid mycorrhizal fungi</a>.

Zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient <a href="soil">soil</a> is <a href="Tillage">cultivated</a> in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia. Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (<a href="zinc%20phosphide">zinc phosphide</a>), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.

Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just <a href="mole%20%28unit%29">micromolar</a> amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all "<a href="Daphnia">Daphnia</a>" in water.

The free zinc ion is a powerful <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a> up to the point of being <a href="corrosive">corrosive</a>. Stomach acid contains <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one <a href="Cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cent</a> piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.

Evidence shows that people taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily may suffer induced <a href="copper%20deficiency">copper deficiency</a>. A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. A condition called the <a href="zinc%20shakes">zinc shakes</a> or "zinc chills" can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while <a href="brazing">brazing</a> or welding galvanized materials. Zinc is a common ingredient of <a href="denture">denture</a> cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram. Disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed.

The U.S. <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing <a href="anosmia">anosmia</a>. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent <a href="polio">polio</a> infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.

Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent <a href="heat%20shock">heat shock</a> response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of <a href="Poly%20ADP%20ribose%20polymerase">PARP</a>-dependent energy crisis in cultured human <a href="keratinocyte">keratinocyte</a>s and <a href="melanocyte">melanocyte</a>s.

In 1982, the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">US Mint</a> began minting <a href="Cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">pennies</a> coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>. Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a> and <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a> (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.

Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe <a href="hemolytic%20anemia">hemolytic anemia</a> and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in <a href="parrots">parrots</a> and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.

Zhang Heng

Zhang Heng (; AD 78–139), formerly <a href="romanization%20of%20Chinese">romanized</a> as Chang Heng, was a <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> <a href="polymath">polymath</a> from <a href="Nanyang%2C%20Henan">Nanyang</a> who lived during the <a href="Eastern%20Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a>. Educated in the capital cities of <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a> and <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>, he achieved success as an <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">astronomer</a>, <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">mathematician</a>, <a href="scientist">scientist</a>, <a href="engineer">engineer</a>, <a href="inventor">inventor</a>, <a href="geographer">geographer</a>, <a href="History%20of%20cartography%23China">cartographer</a>, <a href="Chinese%20painting">artist</a>, <a href="Chinese%20poetry">poet</a>, statesman, and literary scholar.

Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Shun%20of%20Han">Emperor Shun</a> (r. 125–144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of <a href="Hejian">Hejian</a> in <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a>. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.

Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first <a href="Hydraulics">water-powered</a> <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a> to assist astronomical observation; improved the inflow <a href="water%20clock">water clock</a> by adding another tank; and invented the world's first <a href="seismoscope">seismoscope</a>, which discerned the <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a> of an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> away. He improved previous Chinese calculations for <a href="pi">pi</a>. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive <a href="star%20catalog">star catalog</a>, Zhang also posited theories about the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> and its relationship to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the <a href="Lunar%20phase">hidden nature</a> of the other, and the nature of <a href="Solar%20eclipse">solar</a> and <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar</a> <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s. His "<a href="fu%20%28poetry%29">fu</a>" (rhapsody) and "<a href="shi%20%28poetry%29">shi</a>" poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (AD 86–161).

Born in the town of <a href="Xi%27e">Xi'e</a> in <a href="Nanyang%20Commandery">Nanyang Commandery</a> (north of the modern <a href="Nanyang%2C%20Henan">Nanyang City</a> in <a href="Henan">Henan</a> <a href="provinces%20of%20China">province</a>), Zhang Heng came from a distinguished but not very affluent family. His grandfather Zhang Kan had been governor of a <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">commandery</a> and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han</a> by <a href="Emperor%20Guangwu%20of%20Han">Emperor Guangwu</a> (r. 25–57), following the death of the usurping <a href="Wang%20Mang">Wang Mang</a> of the <a href="Xin%20Dynasty">Xin</a> (AD 9–23). When he was ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother. An accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the <a href="capitals%20of%20China">capitals</a> of <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a> and <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>. While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a> near <a href="Mount%20Li">Mount Li</a> and dedicated one of his earliest <a href="Fu%20%28poetry%29">"fu" poems</a> to it. This work, entitled ""Fu" on the Hot Springs" ("Wēnquán fù" 溫泉賦), describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the "<a href="Huaqing%20Pool">Huaqing Hot Springs</a>", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine <a href="Yang%20Guifei">Yang Guifei</a> during the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a>. After studying for some years at Luoyang's <a href="Taixue">Taixue</a>, he was well-versed in the <a href="Chinese%20classic%20texts">classics</a> and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher <a href="Cui%20Yuan%20%28Han%20dynasty%29">Cui Yuan</a> (78–143), the official and philosophical commentator <a href="Ma%20Rong">Ma Rong</a> (79–166), and the philosopher <a href="Wang%20Fu%20%28philosopher%29">Wang Fu</a> (78–163). Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the <a href="Three%20Excellencies">Imperial Secretaries</a>, yet he acted modestly and declined. At age twenty-three, he returned home with the title "Officer of Merit in Nanyang", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor <a href="Bao%20De">Bao De</a> (in office from 103–111). As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents. As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office. He spent much of his time composing <a href="Rhapsody%20%28music%29">rhapsodies</a> on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi'e. Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">mathematics</a>.

In 112, Zhang was summoned to the court of <a href="Emperor%20An%20of%20Han">Emperor An</a> (r. 106–125), who had heard of his expertise in mathematics. When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the <a href="Three%20Excellencies">Imperial Secretariat</a>. He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132. As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of <a href="Nine%20Ministers">Nine Ministers</a> ranked just below the Three Excellencies. In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the <a href="Censorate">Censorate</a>, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 <a href="Chinese%20characters">characters</a> and all major writing styles. Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving <a href="memorials%20to%20the%20throne">memorials to the throne</a> (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.
When the government official Dan Song proposed the <a href="Chinese%20calendar">Chinese calendar</a> should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain <a href="Apocrypha">apocryphal teachings</a>, Zhang opposed the idea. He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors. Others shared Zhang's opinion and the calendar was not altered, yet Zhang's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected. The officials Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu, members of a committee to compile the dynastic history "Dongguan Hanji" (), sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng. However, Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of <a href="Gengshi%20Emperor">Gengshi Emperor</a>'s (r. 23–25) role in the restoration of the Han Dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu's. Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu were Zhang's only historian allies at court, and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian.

Despite this setback in his official career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after <a href="Emperor%20Shun%20of%20Han">Emperor Shun of Han</a> (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne. His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600 bushels, or "<a href="Government%20of%20the%20Han%20Dynasty%23Salaries">shi</a>", of grain (mostly commuted to <a href="Chinese%20coins">coin cash</a> or bolts of <a href="silk">silk</a>). To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100 bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000 bushels during the Han. The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.

In 132, Zhang introduced an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Luoyang in <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a> province.
A year after Zhang presented his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven. The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's <a href="memorial%20to%20the%20throne">memorial</a> discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title "<a href="Xiaolian">Filial and Incorrupt</a>" at age forty. The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen. Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun. With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000 bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.

As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence. The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a "fu" rhapsody called ""Fu" on Pondering the Mystery", which vents his frustration. <a href="Rafe%20de%20Crespigny">Rafe de Crespigny</a> states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to <a href="Qu%20Yuan">Qu Yuan</a>'s (340–278 BC) poem "<a href="Li%20Sao">Li Sao</a>" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.
While working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion. Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the "<a href="Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian">Records of the Grand Historian</a>" by <a href="Sima%20Qian">Sima Qian</a> (145–90 BC) and the "<a href="Book%20of%20Han">Book of Han</a>" by <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> (AD 32–92) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him. His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th century text of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Later%20Han">Book of Later Han</a>" by <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a> (398–445). His <a href="Rhapsody%20%28music%29">rhapsodies</a> and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a>, and <a href="Twenty-Four%20Histories">histories</a>. He also compiled a commentary on the "Taixuan" (, "Great Mystery") by the <a href="Taoism">Daoist</a> author <a href="Yang%20Xiong%20%28author%29">Yang Xiong</a> (53 BC–AD 18).

<a href="Xiao%20Tong">Xiao Tong</a> (501–531), a <a href="crown%20prince">crown prince</a> of the <a href="Liang%20Dynasty">Liang Dynasty</a> (502–557), immortalized several of Zhang's works in his literary anthology, <a href="Wen%20Xuan">"Selections of Refined Literature (Wen xuan" 文選")"</a>. Zhang's rhapsodies (, "<a href="fu%20%28literature%29">fu</a>") include "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ("Xī jīng fù" 西京賦), "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody" ("Dōng jīng fù" 東京賦), "Southern Capital Rhapsody" ("Nán dū fù" 南都賦), "Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" ("Sī xuán fù" 思玄賦), and "<a href="Return%20to%20the%20Field%20%28rhapsody%29">Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields</a>" ("Guī tián fù" 歸田賦). The latter fuses <a href="Daoism">Daoist</a> ideas with <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi. A set of four short lyric poems ("<a href="shi%20%28poetry%29">shi</a>" <a href="shi%20%28poetry%29">詩</a>) entitled "Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows" ("Sì chóu fù" 四愁詩), is also included with Zhang's preface. This set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic "shi" <a href="Chinese%20poetry">Chinese poetry</a> written. While still in Luoyang, Zhang became inspired to write his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" and "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody", which were based on the "Rhapsody on the Two Capitals" by the historian Ban Gu. Zhang's work was similar to Ban's, although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity. These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes. Zhang's "Southern Capital Rhapsody" commemorated his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han Dynasty, Guangwu.

In Zhang Heng's poem "Four Sorrows", he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains, snows and rivers. Rafe de Crespigny, Tong Xiao, and David R. Knechtges claim that Zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor, hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men. This poem is one of the first in China to have seven words per line. His "Four Sorrows" reads:

In another poem of his called "Stabilizing the Passions" ("Dìng qíng fù" 定情賦) — preserved in a <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618–907) encyclopedia, but referred to earlier by <a href="Tao%20Yuanming">Tao Qian</a> (365–427) in praise of Zhang's lyrical minimalism — Zhang displays his admiration for an attractive and exemplary woman. This simpler type of "fu" poem influenced later works by the prominent official and scholar <a href="Cai%20Yong">Cai Yong</a> (132–192). Zhang wrote:

Zhang's long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody "Sir Based-On-Nothing" provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>, the Western Han capital. Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer <a href="bamboo%20shoot">bamboo shoot</a>s, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, <a href="perilla">perilla</a>, <a href="tetradium">evodia</a>, and purple ginger. Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400 "<a href="Li%20%28unit%29">li</a>" (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8 m, or 1,364 ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320 m, or 545,600 ft). Along with <a href="Sima%20Xiangru">Sima Xiangru</a> (179–117 BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from: <a href="Northern%20and%20southern%20China">northern or southern China</a>. Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of along Chang'an's Kunming Lake. The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of <a href="ethnographic">ethnographic</a> categorization. In his poem "Xijing fu", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, introduced via the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>, as well as the legend of the birth of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a> with the vision of the <a href="white%20elephant">white elephant</a> bringing about conception. In his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (西京賦), Zhang described court entertainments such as "juedi" (角抵), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks.

With his "Responding to Criticism" ("Ying jian" 應間), a work modeled on <a href="Yang%20Xiong%20%28author%29">Yang Xiong's</a> "Justification Against Ridicule", Zhang was an early writer and proponent of the Chinese literary genre "shelun", or hypothetical discourse. Authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person (or a real person of their entourage or association); the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life. He also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office, but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power. In this work, Dominik Declercq asserts that the person urging Zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or <a href="Liang%20Na">Empress Liang</a>'s (116–150) powerful relatives in the <a href="Liang%20%28surname%29">Liang clan</a>. Declercq states that these two groups would have been "anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side", but Zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power.

Zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls. This was seen as a general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites, guised in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors. Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence, Zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a>. In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han Dynasty, Zhang wrote:

For centuries the Chinese approximated <a href="pi">pi</a> as 3; <a href="Liu%20Xin%20%28scholar%29">Liu Xin</a> (d. AD 23) made the first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.1457, but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure. In his work around 130, Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724. In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 4:3. In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D:V = 16:9 or V=formula_1D; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio. Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional formula_2D, hence V=formula_1D + formula_2D = formula_5D. With the ratio of the <a href="volume">volume</a> of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is √8:√5. From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the <a href="square%20root">square root</a> of 10 (or approximately 3.162). Zhang also calculated pi as formula_6 = 3.1466 in his book "Ling Xian" (靈憲). In the 3rd century, <a href="Liu%20Hui">Liu Hui</a> made the calculation more accurate with his <a href="Liu%20Hui%27s%20%CF%80%20algorithm">π algorithm</a>, which allowed him to obtain the value 3.14159. Later, <a href="Zu%20Chongzhi">Zu Chongzhi</a> (429–500) <a href="Mil%C3%BC">approximated pi</a> as formula_7 or 3.141592, the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve.
In his publication of AD 120 called "The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe" (靈憲, "Ling Xian", lit. "Sublime Model"), Zhang Heng theorized that the universe was like an egg "as round as a <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a> pellet" with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk. This universe theory is congruent with the <a href="geocentric%20model">geocentric model</a> as opposed to the <a href="Heliocentrism">heliocentric model</a>. Although the ancient <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States</a> (403–221 BC) Chinese astronomers <a href="Shi%20Shen">Shi Shen</a> and <a href="Gan%20De">Gan De</a> had compiled China's first <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a> in the 4th century BC, Zhang nonetheless catalogued 2,500 stars which he placed in a "brightly shining" category (the Chinese estimated the total to be 14,000), and he recognized 124 constellations. In comparison, this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the Greek astronomer <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> (c. 190–c.120 BC) in his catalogue, and more than <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (AD 83–161), who catalogued over 1,000. Zhang supported the "radiating influence" theory to explain <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar</a> and <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar</a> eclipses, a theory which was opposed by <a href="Wang%20Chong">Wang Chong</a> (AD 27–97). In the "Ling Xian", Zhang wrote:

The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water. The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself—this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse.

Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state. Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The <a href="Music%20theory">music theorist</a> and mathematician <a href="Jing%20Fang">Jing Fang</a> (78–37 BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:

The Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.

The theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as <a href="Shen%20Kuo">Shen Kuo</a> (1031–1095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical. The theory of the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a> surrounding a <a href="Flat%20Earth">flat, square earth</a> was later criticized by the <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%28265-420%29">Jin-dynasty</a> scholar-official <a href="Yu%20Xi">Yu Xi</a> (fl. 307-345). He suggested that the Earth could be round like the heavens, a <a href="spherical%20Earth">spherical Earth</a> theory fully accepted by mathematician <a href="Li%20Ye%20%28mathematician%29">Li Ye</a> (1192-1279) but not by mainstream Chinese science until <a href="History%20of%20astronomy">European influence</a> in the 17th century.

The outflow <a href="Water%20clock">clepsydra</a> was a timekeeping device used in China as long ago as the <a href="Shang%20Dynasty">Shang Dynasty</a> (c. 1600–c. 1050 BC), and certainly by the <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a> (1122–256 BC). The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China since the beginning of the Han Dynasty in 202 BC and had replaced the outflow type. The <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> noted the problem with the falling <a href="pressure%20head">pressure head</a> in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled. Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right. Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all <a href="Striking%20clock">clock jacks that would later sound the hours</a> found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours. Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the <a href="Sui%20Dynasty">Sui Dynasty</a> (581–618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed <a href="steelyard%20balance">steelyard balance</a> able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year. Zhang mentioned a "jade dragon's neck", which in later times meant a siphon. He wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows:

Bronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.

Zhang Heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic <a href="motive%20power">motive power</a> (i.e. by employing a <a href="waterwheel">waterwheel</a> and <a href="Water%20clock">clepsydra</a>) to rotate an <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a>, an astronomical instrument representing the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>. The Greek astronomer <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> (276–194 BC) invented the first armillary sphere in 255 BC. The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52 BC, with the astronomer Geng Shouchang's addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring. In AD 84  the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring, and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings. This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan, referencing his book "Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh" (Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by Clepsydra Water). It was likely not an actual book by Zhang, but a chapter from his "Hun I" or "Hun I Thu Chu", written in 117 AD. His water-powered armillary influenced the design of later Chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the <a href="escapement">escapement</a> mechanism by the 8th century. The historian <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a> (1900–1995) states:

What were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725 ) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.

Zhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of <a href="hydraulic%20engineering">hydraulic engineering</a>, which began during the mid Zhou Dynasty (c. 6th century BC), through the work of engineers such as <a href="Sunshu%20Ao">Sunshu Ao</a> and <a href="Ximen%20Bao">Ximen Bao</a>. Zhang's contemporary, <a href="Du%20Shi">Du Shi</a>, (d. AD 38) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the <a href="bellows">bellows</a> of a <a href="blast%20furnace">blast furnace</a> to make <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a>, and the <a href="cupola%20furnace">cupola furnace</a> to make <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a>. Zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125, stating:

The equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.

Zhang Heng's water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations. His model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water-powered instruments of later astronomers such as <a href="Yi%20Xing">Yi Xing</a> (683–727), <a href="Zhang%20Sixun">Zhang Sixun</a> (fl. 10th century), <a href="Su%20Song">Su Song</a> (1020–1101), <a href="Guo%20Shoujing">Guo Shoujing</a> (1231–1316), and many others. Water-powered armillary spheres in the tradition of Zhang Heng's were used in the eras of the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a> (220–280) and <a href="Jin%20Dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29">Jin Dynasty</a> (265–420), yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418, due to invasions of northern <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a> nomads. Zhang Heng's old instruments were recovered in 418, when <a href="Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Liu%20Song">Emperor Wu of Liu Song</a> (r. 420–422) captured the ancient capital of Chang'an. Although still intact, the graduation marks and the representations of the stars, Moon, Sun, and planets were quite worn down by time and rust. In 436, the emperor ordered Qian Luozhi, the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar, to recreate Zhang's device, which he managed to do successfully. Qian's water-powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the Liang Dynasty (502–557), and successive models of water-powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties.

From the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian" of 91 BC that in 780 BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of <a href="tectonic%20plate">tectonic plate</a>s in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a>, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the "<a href="I%20Ching">Yijing</a>" (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a>. <a href="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> (c. 500–428 BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> (c. 460–370 BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; <a href="Anaximenes%20of%20Miletus">Anaximenes</a> (c. 585–c. 525 BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384–322 BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor ("pneuma") caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.

During the Han Dynasty, many learned scholars—including Zhang Heng—believed in the "<a href="oracle">oracle</a>s of the winds". These oracles of the occult observed the direction, force, and timing of the winds, to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth. These ideas influenced Zhang Heng's views on the cause of earthquakes. Against the grain of earlier theories proposed by his fellow Chinese and contemporary Greeks, Zhang Heng believed that earthquakes were caused by wind and air, writing:

In 132, Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions. It was named "earthquake weathervane" ("houfeng didongyi" 候風地動儀), and it was able to roughly determine the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from. According to the "<a href="Book%20of%20Later%20Han">Book of Later Han</a>" (compiled by <a href="Fan%20Ye%20%28historian%29">Fan Ye</a> in the 5th century), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away. This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster. The "Book of Later Han" records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern <a href="Gansu%20Province">Gansu Province</a>), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.

To indicate the direction of a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a <a href="compass%20rose">compass rose</a>. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. <a href="Wang%20Zhenduo">Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸)</a> argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.
Later Chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent Zhang's seismoscope. They included the 6th-century mathematician and surveyor <a href="Xindu%20Fang">Xindu Fang</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Qi">Northern Qi Dynasty</a> (550–577) and the astronomer and mathematician <a href="Lin%20Xiaogong">Lin Xiaogong</a> of the <a href="Sui%20Dynasty">Sui Dynasty</a> (581–618). Like Zhang, Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court. By the time of the <a href="Yuan%20Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> (1271–1368), it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved, except for that of the seismoscope. This was discussed by the scholar Zhou Mi around 1290, who remarked that the books of Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found. Horwitz, Kreitner, and Needham speculate if <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618–907) era seismographs found their way to contemporary <a href="Japan">Japan</a>; according to Needham, "instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder, have been described."

Hong-sen Yan states that modern replicas of Zhang's device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in Chinese historical records. Wang Zhenduo presented two different models of the seismoscope based on the ancient descriptions of Zhang's device. In his 1936 reconstruction, the central pillar ("du zhu") of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor, while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an <a href="inverted%20pendulum">inverted pendulum</a>. According to Needham, while working in the Seismological Observatory of <a href="Tokyo%20University">Tokyo University</a> in 1939, <a href="Akitsune%20Imamura">Akitsune Imamura</a> and Hagiwara made a reconstruction of Zhang's device. While it was John Milne and Wang Zhenduo who argued early on that Zhang's "central pillar" was a suspended pendulum, Imamura was the first to propose an inverted model. He argued that transverse shock would have rendered Wang's immobilization mechanism ineffective, as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position. On June 13, 2005, modern Chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument.

Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, a Professor of Early Chinese History at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, names Zhang Heng as one of several high-ranking Eastern-Han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans ("gong" 工), such as mechanical engineering. Barbieri-Low speculates that Zhang only designed his seismoscope, but did not actually craft the device himself. He asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by Zhang. He writes: "Zhang Heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the "gong" artisans and the government slaves. Most likely, he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops."

The <a href="Cao%20Wei">Wei</a> (220–265) and <a href="Jin%20Dynasty%20%28265-420%29">Jin Dynasty</a> (265–420) <a href="History%20of%20cartography%23China">cartographer</a> and official <a href="Pei%20Xiu">Pei Xiu</a> (224–271) was the first in China to describe in full the geometric <a href="grid%20reference">grid reference</a> for maps that allowed for precise measurements <a href="Scale%20%28map%29">using a graduated scale</a>, as well as topographical <a href="elevation">elevation</a>. However, map-making in China had existed since at least the 4th century BC with the <a href="Qin%20%28state%29">Qin state</a> maps found in <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a> in 1986. Pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the <a href="Qin%20Dynasty">Qin</a> and Han Dynasty, respectively, as evidenced by their existing maps, while the use of a rectangular <a href="Grid%20graph">grid</a> had been known in China since the Han as well. Historian Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng. Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography. Needham points out that the title of his book "Flying Bird Calendar" may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled "Bird's Eye Map". Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative "Guitian fu" contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a> of the Zhou Dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps ("tu") on a same level of importance with documents ("shu"). It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a "Ti Hsing Thu".

Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first <a href="odometer">odometer</a>, an achievement also attributed to <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> (c. 287–212 BC) and <a href="Heron%20of%20Alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</a> (fl. AD 10–70). Similar devices were used by the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had termed the device the "ji li gu che", or "<a href="li%20%28unit%29">li</a>-recording drum carriage" (the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640 ft).
Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the "huang men"—court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal "drum-chariot". There is speculation that at some time during the 1st century BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of <a href="Luoxia%20Hong">Luoxia Hong</a> (c. 110 BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.

The <a href="south-pointing%20chariot">south-pointing chariot</a> was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. <a href="differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">Differential gears</a> driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The "Song Shu" (c. AD 500 ) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, <a href="Ma%20Jun">Ma Jun</a> (200–265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.

Zhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century <a href="clock%20tower">clock tower</a>. The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official <a href="Chen%20Hongmou">Chen Hongmou</a> (1696–1771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book "Spiritual Constitution of the Universe". The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and <a href="James%20Alfred%20Ewing">James A. Ewing</a> at the <a href="Imperial%20College%20of%20Engineering">Imperial College of Engineering</a> in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to <a href="seismology">seismology</a>. The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to "make three wheels rotate as if they were one." More than one scholar has described Zhang as a <a href="polymath">polymath</a>. However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories. Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83–161) of <a href="History%20of%20Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:

Zhang's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death. In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the <a href="Eastern%20Wu">Eastern Wu</a> official <a href="Xue%20Zong">Xue Zong</a> (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems "Dongjing fu" and "Xijing fu". The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its "curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity", in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet. Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong "avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity", and adding that their "compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature".

Zhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet <a href="Fu%20Xuan">Fu Xuan</a> (217–278) of the <a href="Cao%20Wei">Wei</a> and <a href="Jin%20Dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29">Jin</a> dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the <a href="Nine%20Ministers">Ministry of Works</a>. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, "Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it—is this not hateful and disastrous?"

In honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the "Guwen yuan". Cui stated, "[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods." The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243–291) of the Wei Dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb. It read: "Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts, none has been as skillful as the Master [Zhang Heng] in choosing his words well ... if only the dead could rise, oh I could then turn to him for a teacher!"

Several things have been named after Zhang in modern times, including the lunar crater <a href="Chang%20Heng%20%28crater%29">Chang Heng</a>, the asteroid <a href="1802%20Zhang%20Heng">1802 Zhang Heng</a>, and the mineral <a href="zhanghengite">zhanghengite</a>. In 2018, China launched a research satellite called China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) which is also named Zhangheng-1 (ZH-1).

Roger B. Chaffee

Roger Bruce Chaffee (, February 15, 1935 – January 27, 1967) was an American <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">naval officer</a> and <a href="United%20States%20naval%20aviator">aviator</a>, <a href="Aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineer</a>, and NASA <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> in the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>.

Chaffee was born in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, where he became an <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scout</a>. He graduated from <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">Central High School</a> in 1953, and accepted a <a href="Naval%20ROTC">Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps</a> (NROTC) scholarship. He began his college education at <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, where he was involved in the fraternity <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Sigma">Phi Kappa Sigma</a>. He transferred to <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> in 1954, continuing his involvement in Phi Kappa Sigma and obtaining his private pilot's license.

After graduating from Purdue in 1957, Chaffee completed his Navy training and was commissioned as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23United%20States">ensign</a>. He began pilot training at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">Naval Air Station Pensacola</a>, Florida, flying aircraft such as the <a href="Beechcraft%20T-34%20Mentor">T-34</a>, <a href="North%20American%20T-28%20Trojan">T-28</a>, and <a href="Douglas%20A-3%20Skywarrior">A3D</a>. He became quality and safety control officer for <a href="VAP-62">Heavy Photographic Squadron 62</a> (VAP-62). His time in this unit included taking crucial photos of Cuba during the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, earning him the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>. He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> in 1966.

Along with thirteen other pilots, Chaffee was selected to be an astronaut as part of <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%203">NASA Astronaut Group 3</a> in 1963. He served as <a href="capsule%20communicator">capsule communicator</a> (CAPCOM) for the <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a> and <a href="Gemini%204">Gemini 4</a> missions and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966 as the third-ranking pilot on <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a>. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Virgil "Gus" Grissom</a> and <a href="Ed%20White%20%28astronaut%29">Ed White</a> during a pre-launch test for the mission at what was then the <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34</a>, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> and a second Air Medal.

Roger Bruce Chaffee was born on February 15, 1935, in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, the second child of Donald Lynn Chaffee and Blanche May (Mike) Chaffee Mosher. He had an older sister, Donna, born two years earlier. In January 1935, in their hometown of <a href="Greenville%2C%20Michigan">Greenville, Michigan</a>, his father was diagnosed with <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a>, and Mike moved in with her parents in Grand Rapids, where Roger was born. The family spent the next seven years in Greenville before moving to Grand Rapids, where his father took a job as the chief Army Ordnance inspector at the Doehler-Jarvis plant. Chaffee's interest in aerospace was sparked at a young age when his father, a former <a href="barnstorming">barnstorming</a> pilot, took him on his first flight at the age of seven. Chaffee was thrilled by the flight and soon after started building model airplanes with his father.

Chaffee excelled as a <a href="Scouts%20BSA%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Boy Scout</a>, earning his first <a href="Merit%20badge%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">merit badge</a> at the age of thirteen. He earned ten more badges that year. Many of these awards were typically earned by the older scouts. He continued his success by earning four more badges at the age of fourteen. He earned four badges for each of the next two years, almost all the badges available at the time. After becoming an <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scout</a>, he managed to earn another ten merit badges, for which he was awarded the bronze and gold palms. Between his camping trips with his family and his involvement with the Boy Scouts, Chaffee developed a passion for the outdoors.

Chaffee attended the Dickinson School in Grand Rapids, and later graduated in the top fifth of his class from <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">Central High School</a> in 1953. Turning down a possible appointment to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, he accepted a <a href="Naval%20ROTC">Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps</a> (NROTC) scholarship, and in September 1953 enrolled at the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. He performed well, making the <a href="Dean%27s%20List">Dean's List</a> and finishing with a B+ average. While enrolled, he joined <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Sigma">Phi Kappa Sigma</a>.

Chaffee was passionate about flying, and had a strong aptitude for science and engineering. To apply those talents, he transferred to <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> in the autumn of 1954 to attend the school's well-known <a href="aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a> program. Before arriving in <a href="West%20Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">West Lafayette</a>, he reported for an 8-week tour on as a part of the NROTC program. To qualify, he had to finish training and pass further tests. He initially failed the eye exam, but the physician permitted him to retake the test the next morning, and he passed. He was then allowed to tour on "Wisconsin" to England, Scotland, France, and Cuba. Upon his return to American soil, he worked as a gear cutter.

After starting classes at Purdue, Chaffee sought out a job to complement his coursework and involvement in the Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. His first job during his sophomore year was working as a server at one of the women's residences, but he disliked the job and sought new employment. He was hired as a <a href="draftsman">draftsman</a> at a small business near Purdue. As a <a href="Junior%20%28education%29">junior</a>, he was hired as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department to teach classes to <a href="freshman">freshman</a> students. He also joined the <a href="Tau%20Beta%20Pi">Tau Beta Pi</a> and <a href="Sigma%20Gamma%20Tau">Sigma Gamma Tau</a> engineering honor societies.
In 1955, Chaffee took four flying lessons, but he did not have enough money to get his <a href="private%20pilot%27s%20license">private pilot's license</a>. Two years later, the NROTC sponsored flight training for him to become a <a href="naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a>. He soloed on March 29, 1957 and obtained his private pilot's license on May 24, 1957. He earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree, with distinction, in aeronautical engineering at Purdue in 1957.

Chaffee met his future wife Martha Louise Horn on a double blind date in September 1955. They started dating, and he proposed to her on October 12, 1956. They married in <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City</a>, Martha's hometown, on August 24, 1957. Martha was a homemaker. The couple had two children, Sheryl Lyn (born in 1958) and Stephen (born in 1961).

After graduation, Chaffee completed his Navy training on August 22, 1957, and was commissioned as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a>. Following his honeymoon, he was assigned to the aircraft carrier for a six-week assignment in Norfolk with the Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. By the time Chaffee arrived at the base, the ship had already left port. He temporarily worked at the base until October 1957, when he attended flight school at the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">Naval Air Station Pensacola</a>, Florida. He started his training by flying the <a href="North%20American%20T-28%20Trojan">T-28</a> and the <a href="Beechcraft%20T-34%20Mentor">T-34</a>. He was posted to the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Kingsville">Naval Air Station Kingsville</a>, Texas, from August 1958 to February 1959 as a part of Advanced Training Unit 212. In Kingsville, he trained on the <a href="F9F%20Cougar">F9F Cougar</a> jet fighter. His daughter Sheryl was born the day before he left for his first <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> training. He was awarded his naval aviator <a href="United%20States%20Aviator%20Badge">wings</a> in early 1959.

Chaffee was transferred to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Jacksonville">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a>, Florida, to continue his training. His first project was not flying, but repairing a <a href="Douglas%20A-3%20Skywarrior">A3D</a> twin-engine jet photo reconnaissance plane. This plane was typically flown by pilots with the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> or above, but Chaffee became so familiar with the plane from repairing it he became one of the youngest pilots ever to fly it. He joined <a href="Second%20VA-44%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29">Attack Squadron 44</a> (VA-44) in September 1959, and from October 1959 to March 1960 he trained with <a href="RVAH-3">Reconnaissance Attack Squadron (Heavy) 3</a> (RVAH-3).
Chaffee was given a variety of assignments, and participated in numerous training duties over the next few years, spending most of his time in photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for <a href="VAP-62">Heavy Photographic Squadron 62</a> (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a>, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.

Between April 4, 1960, and October 25, 1962, including during the critical time of the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, Chaffee flew 82 missions over Cuba, sometimes up to three per day, and achieved over 100 flight hours each month. Some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane back and forth to <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a>, including the pilot, co-pilot, and the photographer. Some biographies credit him with flying the <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">U-2</a> plane to spy on Cuba, but this is erroneous since he was a Navy pilot and the U-2 was an Air Force plane.

After this, Chaffee undertook aircraft carrier flight training, including time spent on performing both day and night flights. He said of day flying, "Setting that big bird down on the flight deck was like landing on a postage stamp"; and of night flying, "Getting catapulted off that flight deck at night is like getting shot into a bottle of ink!" While working in Jacksonville, he concurrently worked on a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a>. He was on a cruise to Africa when his son Stephen was born in Oklahoma City.

During Chaffee's Navy service he logged more than 2,300 hours flying time, including more than 2,000 hours in jet aircraft. On February 1, 1966, he was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a>.

In August 1962, Chaffee confided in his family that he had submitted an application for the <a href="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a> for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%203">third group of NASA astronauts</a>. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered him the opportunity to continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. <a href="Air%20Force%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Air Force Institute of Technology</a> (AFIT) at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, to work on his <a href="Master%20of%20Science">Master of Science</a> degree in <a href="reliability%20engineering">reliability engineering</a>.

While at AFIT, Chaffee continued to participate in astronaut candidate testing as the pool of candidates dropped to 271 in mid-1963. It was noted during testing that he had a very small lung capacity, but that he used it better than most people with greater capacity. On his return from a hunting trip to <a href="Fairborn%2C%20Ohio">Fairborn, Ohio</a>, on October 14, 1963, he found a message from NASA in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas. He called them back, and discovered he had been chosen as an astronaut. On October 18, 1963, it was officially announced that he was one of fourteen chosen for NASA's third group of astronauts. He said, "I was very pleased with the appointment. I've always wanted to fly and perform adventurous flying tasks all my life. Ever since the first <a href="Mercury%20Seven">seven Mercury astronauts</a> were named, I've been keeping my studies up."

Phase one of training for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. As well as piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts were to perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled to the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> to learn about geography and to Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.

The second phase was contingency training, which focused on astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off in the middle of the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a>. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.

The third and final phase was operational training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of <a href="microgravity">microgravity</a> and rapid <a href="acceleration">acceleration</a>. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activities</a> (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants to check on the progress of the hardware.

Every astronaut was required to have a specialty, and Chaffee's specialty was communications. He focused on the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF), which the astronauts needed for navigation in space.

At the <a href="Manned%20Spacecraft%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> in Houston, Chaffee served as <a href="capsule%20communicator">capsule communicator</a> (CAPCOM) in March 1965 for <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a>. Later that year, he was CAPCOM, along with <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Virgil "Gus" Grissom</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Cernan">Eugene Cernan</a>, for the <a href="Gemini%204">Gemini 4</a> mission, in which <a href="Ed%20White%20%28astronaut%29">Ed White</a> performed the first spacewalk by an American. As CAPCOM, Chaffee relayed information between the crew members and the Director of Flight Operations, <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.">Chris Kraft</a>. He never got a seat on a <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini</a> mission, but was assigned to work on flight control, communications, instrumentation, and attitude and translation control systems in the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>. During this time, along with Grissom, he also flew chase planes at an altitude of between to take motion pictures of the launch of an unmanned <a href="Saturn%201B">Saturn 1B</a> rocket.

Chaffee received his first spaceflight assignment in January 1966, when he was selected for the first crewed Apollo-Saturn flight, AS-204. At the time, he was the youngest American astronaut to be selected for a mission. Joining Command Pilot Grissom and Senior Pilot White, he replaced the injured <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn F. Eisele</a> in the third-ranked pilot position. Eisele required surgery for a dislocated shoulder, which he sustained aboard the <a href="reduced%20gravity%20aircraft">KC-135 weightlessness training aircraft</a>. He was reassigned to a second Apollo crew, commanded by <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>.

The crew announcement was made public on March 21, 1966. The two-week flight of Apollo 1 was to test the spacecraft systems and the ground tracking and control facilities. While Chaffee had monitored the manufacture of the <a href="Gemini%20%28spacecraft%29">Gemini spacecraft</a>, he had not witnessed the building of the Apollo spacecraft. Three days after being selected for the Apollo 1 crew, he flew out to the <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> Plant in Downey, California, to see it.

Later in April, the crew traveled to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to study stars that were programmed into their flight computer. In October, the six crewmembers planned to test the spacecraft in sea level and altitude conditions. The failure of an oxygen regulator prevented them from performing the vacuum test, but they managed to complete the sea level test. They also performed egress tests, where capsule simulators were dropped in the Gulf of Mexico under various conditions and the crew had to exit the spacecraft. The crew was able to spend time with their families at Christmas. Chaffee entered a local Christmas decoration contest and he received first prize. Four Purdue astronauts were requested to attend the Rose Bowl as guests of honor. Grissom, <a href="Gene%20Cernan">Gene Cernan</a>, Armstrong, and Chaffee attended the game on January 2. Progress on pre-mission activities was nearing completion; NASA announced January 23 that February 21 would be the target launch date. The primary and backup crews moved back to the Cape for the last few weeks of training. They had their own living quarters, a private waiter and chef, and gymnasium to remain fit.
On January 27, 1967, Grissom, White and Chaffee were participating in a "plugs-out" countdown demonstration test at <a href="Cape%20Kennedy">Cape Kennedy</a> in preparation for the planned February 21 launch. Chaffee was sitting at the right side of the cabin. His main role was to maintain communications with the <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a>. A momentary power surge was detected at 23:30:55 GMT, which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on the lower left side of the cabin, the presumed ignition source for the fire. At 23:31:04 GMT, a voice was heard declaring, "[We]'ve got a fire in the cockpit." Most investigative listeners believe that voice was Chaffee's.

Assigned emergency roles called for Grissom, in the left-hand seat, to open the cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the <a href="plug%20door">plug door</a> hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by the intensity of the fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness because of a lack of oxygen which sent him into <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a>. He died from <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a> due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.

Failed oxygen and <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a> pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters were able to open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch was found in the horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.

Shortly after the AS-204 fire in 1967, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight, <a href="George%20Mueller%20%28NASA%29">Dr. George Mueller</a>, announced the mission would be officially designated as Apollo 1. The capsule underwent a significant redesign as a result of the disaster. The atmosphere in the cabin was changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of <a href="nylon">nylon</a>, were changed to <a href="beta%20cloth">beta cloth</a>, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> and coated with <a href="Teflon">Teflon</a>. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin materials with self extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.

Chaffee and Grissom were buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, while White was buried at <a href="West%20Point%20Cemetery">West Point Cemetery</a>. Chaffee's widow received $100,000 from the life insurance portion of the contract the astronauts signed with two publishing firms so they would have exclusive rights to stories and photographs of the astronauts and their families. She also received $16,250 per year for the life of the contract.

Chaffee is memorialized in many ways, from the <a href="Chaffee%20%28crater%29">Chaffee Crater</a> on the <a href="Far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side</a> of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, to the <a href="Roger%20B.%20Chaffee%20Planetarium">Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium</a> in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Another memorial is a hill on <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, Chaffee Hill, south-southwest of <a href="Columbia%20Memorial%20Station">Columbia Memorial Station</a>, part of the <a href="Apollo%201%20Hills">Apollo 1 Hills</a>. "Regor" ("Roger" spelled backwards), is a seldom-used nickname for the star <a href="Gamma%20Velorum">Gamma Velorum</a>. Grissom used this name, plus two others for White and himself, on his Apollo 1 mission planning star charts as a joke, and the succeeding Apollo astronauts kept using the names as a memorial. A terrestrial memorial is Chaffee Island, an <a href="artificial%20island">artificial island</a> off of Long Beach, California, created in 1966 for drilling oil (along with White, Grissom and <a href="Ted%20Freeman">Freeman</a> Islands). A park in <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton, California</a>, was named after Chaffee; parks were also named after his fellow Apollo 1 comrades. Chaffee is named with his Apollo 1 crewmates on the <a href="Space%20Mirror%20Memorial">Space Mirror Memorial</a>, which was dedicated in 1991. Chaffee's name is included on the plaque left on the Moon with the "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>" statue in 1971 by the crew of <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a>.

The dismantled <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Launch Pad 34</a> at Cape Canaveral bears two memorial plaques:

The Roger B. Chaffee scholarship named for him has been awarded annually since 1967 to exceptional students in the Kent Intermediate School District for high school seniors who will be pursuing a career in math and science. Chaffee Hall, an engineering building, was dedicated to him at his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>, Purdue University, in 1968. Grissom High School, Ed White Middle School and Chaffee Elementary School in Huntsville, Alabama, were named for the Apollo 1 astronauts.

Chaffee was awarded the Navy <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a> for his involvement in Heavy Photographic Squadron 62. He completed 82 classified missions "of paramount military importance to the security of the United States". He was posthumously awarded a second Air Medal. He was inducted into the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Space%20History">International Space Hall of Fame</a> in 1983 and into the <a href="United%20States%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame</a>, on October 4, 1997. Chaffee was awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> posthumously in 1997. He was later awarded the NASA Ambassador of Exploration Award for involvement in the U.S. space program in 2007.

In 2018 a life-size bronze statue of Chaffee was unveiled outside the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20Children%27s%20Museum">Grand Rapids Children's Museum</a> in Chaffee's hometown. His wife, other family members, and astronaut <a href="Jack%20Lousma">Jack Lousma</a> (a Grand Rapids native) were present for the event.

Mount St. Helens

Mount St. Helens (known as Lawetlat'la to the indigenous <a href="Cowlitz%20people">Cowlitz people</a>, and Loowit or Louwala-Clough to the <a href="Klickitat%20people">Klickitat</a>) is an active <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> located in <a href="Skamania%20County%2C%20Washington">Skamania County, Washington</a>, in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of the United States. It is northeast of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, Oregon and south of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat <a href="Alleyne%20Fitzherbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20St%20Helens">Lord St Helens</a>, a friend of explorer <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a> who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century. The volcano is located in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> and is part of the <a href="Cascade%20Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanic Arc</a>, a segment of the <a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a> that includes over 160 active volcanoes. This volcano is well known for its <a href="volcanic%20ash">ash</a> explosions and <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s.

Mount St. Helens is most notorious for <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">its major 1980 eruption</a>, the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. Fifty-seven people were killed; 250 homes, 47 bridges, of railways, and of highway were destroyed. A massive <a href="debris%20avalanche">debris avalanche</a> triggered by an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale caused an eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain's summit from to , leaving a wide horseshoe-shaped crater. The debris avalanche was up to in volume. The <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens%20National%20Volcanic%20Monument">Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument</a> was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption's aftermath to be scientifically studied.

As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St. Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of <a href="lava">lava</a> rock interlayered with ash, <a href="pumice">pumice</a>, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and <a href="andesite">andesite</a> through which several <a href="Lava%20dome">domes</a> of <a href="dacite">dacite</a> lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.

Mount St. Helens is west of <a href="Mount%20Adams%20%28Washington%29">Mount Adams</a>, in the western part of the Cascade Range. These "sister and brother" volcanic mountains are approximately from <a href="Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainier</a>, the highest of Cascade volcanoes. <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a>, the nearest major volcanic peak in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, is southeast of Mount St. Helens.

Mount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago. The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).

Prior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens was the fifth-highest peak in Washington. It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre-1980 summit cone, earning it the nickname "<a href="Mount%20Fuji">Fuji-san</a> of America". The peak rose more than above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges. The mountain is across at its base, which is at an elevation of on the northeastern side and elsewhere. At the pre-eruption <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a>, the width of the cone was .
<a href="Stream">Stream</a>s that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: the <a href="Toutle%20River">Toutle River</a> on the north and northwest, the <a href="Kalama%20River">Kalama River</a> on the west, and the <a href="Lewis%20River%20%28Washington%29">Lewis River</a> on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is , and the snow pack on the mountain's upper slopes can reach . The Lewis River is impounded by three <a href="dam">dam</a>s for <a href="hydroelectric%20power">hydroelectric power</a> generation. The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment, the <a href="Swift%20Reservoir">Swift Reservoir</a>, which is directly south of the volcano's peak.

Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through <a href="Cowlitz%20County%2C%20Washington">Cowlitz County</a> to the west and <a href="Lewis%20County%2C%20Washington">Lewis County</a> to the north. <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20504">State Route 504</a>, locally known as the <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20Memorial%20Highway">Spirit Lake Memorial Highway</a>, connects with <a href="Interstate%205%20%28Washington%29">Interstate 5</a> at Exit 49, to the west of the mountain. That north–south highway skirts the low-lying cities of <a href="Castle%20Rock%2C%20Washington">Castle Rock</a>, <a href="Longview%2C%20Washington">Longview</a> and <a href="Kelso%2C%20Washington">Kelso</a> along the <a href="Cowlitz%20River">Cowlitz River</a>, and passes through the <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>–<a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a> less than to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is <a href="Cougar%2C%20Washington">Cougar</a>, Washington, in the Lewis River valley south-southwest of the peak. <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot%20National%20Forest">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</a> surrounds Mount St. Helens.

During the winter of 1980–1981, a new <a href="glacier">glacier</a> appeared. Now officially named <a href="Crater%20Glacier">Crater Glacier</a>, it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly ( per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about , and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of and a maximum of , nearly as deep as the much older and larger <a href="Carbon%20Glacier">Carbon Glacier</a> of Mount Rainier. The ice is all post-1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre-1980 glaciers combined.

With the recent volcanic activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of <a href="icefall">icefall</a>s heavily criss-crossed with <a href="crevasse">crevasse</a>s and <a href="serac">serac</a>s caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.

The early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the "Ape Canyon Stage" (around 40,000–35,000 years ago), the "Cougar Stage" (ca. 20,000–18,000 years ago), and the "Swift Creek Stage" (roughly 13,000–8,000 years ago). The modern period, since about 2500 BCE, is called the "Spirit Lake Stage". Collectively, the pre–Spirit Lake stages are known as the "ancestral stages". The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of <a href="dacite">dacite</a> and <a href="andesite">andesite</a>, while modern lava is very diverse (ranging from <a href="olivine">olivine</a> <a href="basalt">basalt</a> to andesite and dacite).

St. Helens started its growth in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash. Thirty-six thousand years ago a large <a href="lahar">mudflow</a> cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">current ice age</a>.

The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 years ago and lasted for 2,000 years. <a href="Pyroclastic%20flow">Pyroclastic flow</a>s of hot pumice and ash along with <a href="Lava%20dome">dome</a> growth occurred during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with <a href="tephra">tephra</a>. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.

A dormancy of about 4,000 years was broken around 2500 BCE with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period, when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish-brown pumice covered thousands of square miles. An eruption in 1900 BCE was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epoch, judged by the volume of one of the tephra layers from that period. This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BCE and left deep deposits of material distant in what is now <a href="Mt.%20Rainier%20National%20Park">Mt. Rainier National Park</a>. Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as <a href="Banff%20National%20Park">Banff National Park</a> in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, and as far southeast as eastern <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. All told there may have been up to of material ejected in this cycle. Some 400 years of dormancy followed.

St. Helens came alive again around 1200 BCE — the Pine Creek eruptive period. This lasted until about 800 BCE and was characterized by smaller-volume eruptions. Numerous dense, nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens' flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys. A large mudflow partly filled of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE.

The next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BCE, and is characterized by a change in composition of St. Helens' lava, with the addition of <a href="olivine">olivine</a> and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>. The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks (<a href="tephra">tephra</a>) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BCE that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys. Others, such as Cave Basalt (known for its system of <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s), flowed up to from their vents. During the first century, mudflows moved down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. Another 400 years of <a href="dormancy">dormancy</a> ensued.

The Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.

Roughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480, when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt, beginning the Kalama period. The eruption in 1480 was several times larger than the May 18, 1980, eruption. In 1482, another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred. Ash and pumice piled northeast of the volcano to a thickness of ; away, the ash was deep. Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens' west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system.

This 150-year period next saw the eruption of less <a href="silica">silica</a>-rich lava in the form of <a href="andesitic">andesitic</a> ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with <a href="Scree">talus</a>. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, in about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.

The 57-year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome, and is the first time that both oral and written records exist. Like the Kalama period, the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of <a href="dacite">dacite</a> <a href="tephra">tephra</a>, followed by an andesite lava flow, and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome. The 1800 eruption probably rivalled the 1980 eruption in size, although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone. The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, northern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, and western <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857, including a fairly large one in 1842. The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank. Goat Rocks dome was the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption, and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18, 1980 that destroyed the entire north face and top of the mountain.

On March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> 4.2 <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>; and, on March 27, steam venting started. By the end of April, the north side of the mountain had started to bulge. 
On May 18, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.1, triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain. It was the largest known <a href="debris%20avalanche">debris avalanche</a> in recorded history. The <a href="magma">magma</a> in St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a> that flattened vegetation and buildings over . More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide was released into the atmosphere. On the <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a> scale, the eruption was rated a five, and categorized as a <a href="Plinian%20eruption">Plinian eruption</a>.
The collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (volcanic mudflows). The lahars flowed many miles down the <a href="Toutle%20River">Toutle</a> and <a href="Cowlitz%20River">Cowlitz River</a>s, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of of material was transported south into the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> by the mudflows.

For more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching 12 to 16 miles (20 to 27 km) above sea level. The plume moved eastward at an average speed of with ash reaching <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> by noon. Ashes from the eruption were found collecting on top of cars and roofs next morning, as far as the city of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada.
By about 5:30 p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, and less severe outbursts continued through the night and for the next several days. The St. Helens May 18 eruption released 24 megatons of thermal energy; it ejected more than of material. The removal of the north side of the mountain reduced St. Helens' height by about and left a crater to wide and deep, with its north end open in a huge breach. The eruption killed 57 people, nearly 7,000 big game animals (<a href="deer">deer</a>, <a href="elk">elk</a>, and <a href="bear">bear</a>), and an estimated 12 million fish from a hatchery. It destroyed or extensively damaged over 200 homes, of <a href="highway">highway</a> and of <a href="railway">railway</a>s.

Between 1980 and 1986, activity continued at Mount St. Helens, with a new <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a> forming in the crater. Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash.

Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome's south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as a <a href="lava%20spine">lava spine</a> nicknamed the "whaleback", which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.

Mount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a plume of steam and ash emerged—visible from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building. The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2.5 earthquake.

Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the "fin" or "slab". Approximately half the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as per day. In mid-June 2006, the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls, although it was still being extruded. The height of the dome was , still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.

On October 22, 2006, at 3:13 p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume over the western rim of the crater; the <a href="ash%20plume">ash plume</a> then rapidly dissipated.

On December 19, 2006, a large white plume of condensing steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption. However, the <a href="Cascades%20Volcano%20Observatory">Cascades Volcano Observatory</a> of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.

On January 16, 2008, steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome. Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004. Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks, but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low. By the end of January, the eruption paused; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome. On July 10, 2008, it was determined that the eruption had ended, after more than six months of no volcanic activity.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">American Indian</a> lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of these is the <a href="Bridge%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28geologic%20event%29">Bridge of the Gods</a> legend told by the <a href="Klickitat%20people">Klickitat people</a>. In their tale, the chief of all the gods and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.

They came upon an area that is now called <a href="The%20Dalles">The Dalles</a> and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land, so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow — one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. The chief of the gods then built the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.

When the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the <a href="Plunge%20waterfalls">cascades</a> of the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Gorge">Columbia River Gorge</a>.

For punishment, the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means "smoking or fire mountain" in their language (the <a href="Sahaptin%20people">Sahaptin</a> called the mountain Loowit).

The mountain is also of sacred importance to the <a href="Cowlitz%20people">Cowlitz</a> and <a href="Yakama%20people">Yakama</a> tribes that also historically lived in the area. They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance, and the mountain (which they call "Lawetlat'la", roughly translated as "the smoker") features prominently in their creation myth, and in some of their songs and rituals. In recognition of this cultural significance, over of the mountain (roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail) have been listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Other area tribal names for the mountain include "nšh´ák´" ("water coming out") from the <a href="Chehalis%20people">Upper Chehalis</a>, and "aka akn" ("snow mountain"), a <a href="Kiksht">Kiksht</a> term.

<a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> Commander <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a> and the officers of <a href="HMS%20Discovery%20%281789%29">HMS "Discovery"</a> made the Europeans' first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on May 19, 1792, while surveying the northern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> coast. Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat <a href="Alleyne%20Fitzherbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20St%20Helens">Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens</a> on October 20, 1792, as it came into view when the "Discovery" passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.

Years later, explorers, traders, and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area. Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800, marking the beginning of the 57-year-long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period (see <a href="%23Geologic%20history">geology section</a>). Alarmed by the "dry snow," the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation.

In late 1805 and early 1806, members of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one. They did however report the presence of <a href="quicksand">quicksand</a> and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> near Portland, suggesting an eruption by <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a> sometime in the previous decades.

In 1829 <a href="Hall%20J.%20Kelley">Hall J. Kelley</a> led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.

The first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by <a href="Meredith%20Gairdner">Meredith Gairdner</a>, while working for the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>. He sent an account to the "Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal", which published his letter in January 1836. <a href="James%20Dwight%20Dana">James Dwight Dana</a> of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, while sailing with the <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a>, saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described "cellular basaltic lavas" at the mountain's base.
In late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called Great Eruption. This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years. The eruptions of this period were likely <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic</a> (steam explosions). <a href="Josiah%20L.%20Parrish">Josiah Parrish</a> in <a href="Champoeg%2C%20Oregon">Champoeg, Oregon</a> witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22, 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles, Oregon</a>, 48 miles (80 km) southeast of the volcano.

In October 1843, future <a href="California">California</a> governor <a href="Peter%20Hardeman%20Burnett">Peter H. Burnett</a> recounted a story of an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, and two years later Canadian painter <a href="Paul%20Kane">Paul Kane</a> created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.
On April 17, 1857, the "Republican", a <a href="Steilacoom%2C%20Washington">Steilacoom, Washington</a>, newspaper, reported that "Mount St. Helens, or some other mount to the southward, is seen ... to be in a state of eruption". The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption. This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854.

Before the 1980 eruption, <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20%28Washington%29">Spirit Lake</a> offered year-round recreational activities. In the summer there was <a href="boating">boating</a>, <a href="human%20swimming">swimming</a>, and <a href="camping">camping</a>, while in the winter there was <a href="skiing">skiing</a>.

Fifty-seven people were killed during the eruption. Had the eruption occurred one day later, when loggers would have been at work, rather than on a Sunday, the death toll could have been much higher.

83-year-old <a href="Harry%20Randall%20Truman">Harry R. Truman</a>, who had lived near the mountain for 54 years, became famous when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption, despite repeated pleas by local authorities. His body was never found after the eruption.

Another victim of the eruption was 30-year-old <a href="volcanologist">volcanologist</a> <a href="David%20A.%20Johnston">David A. Johnston</a>, who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge. Moments before his position was hit by the pyroclastic flow, Johnston radioed his famous last words: "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" Johnston's body was never found.

<a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> surveyed the damage and said, "Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to what's up there." A film crew, led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber, was dropped by <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their <a href="compass">compass</a>es, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> helicopter pilots. Their film, "The Eruption of Mount St. Helens", later became a popular documentary.

In 1982, President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Congress</a> established the <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens%20National%20Volcanic%20Monument">Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument</a>, a area around the mountain and within the <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot%20National%20Forest">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</a>.

Following the 1980 eruption, the area was left to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when <a href="2004%E2%80%932008%20volcanic%20activity%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">renewed activity</a> caused the closure of the area around the mountain (see "Geological history" section above for more details).

Most notable was the closure of the Monitor Ridge trail, which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater.

The mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000–4900 feet (1,200-1,500 m). The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping, biking, pets, fires, and off-trail excursions are all prohibited.

Mount St. Helens is a popular climbing destination for both beginning and experienced <a href="Mountaineering">mountaineers</a>. The peak is climbed year-round, although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall. All routes include sections of steep, rugged terrain. 
A permit system has been in place for climbers since 1987. A climbing permit is required year-round for anyone who will be above on the slopes of Mount St. Helens.

The standard <a href="hiking">hiking</a>/<a href="mountaineering">mountaineering</a> route in the warmer months is the Monitor Ridge Route, which starts at the Climbers Bivouac. This is the most popular and crowded route to the summit in the summer and gains about in approximately to reach the crater rim. 
Although strenuous, it is considered non-technical climb that involves some <a href="scrambling">scrambling</a>. Most climbers complete the round trip in 7 to 12 hours.

The Worm Flows Route is considered the standard winter route on Mount St. Helens, as it is the most direct route to the summit. The route gains about in elevation over about from trailhead to summit but does not demand the technical climbing that some other Cascade peaks like <a href="Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainier</a> do. The route name refers to the rocky lava flows that surround the route. 
This route can be accessed via the Marble Mountain Sno-Park and the Swift Ski Trail.

Bristol

Bristol () is a <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city</a> and <a href="Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">county</a> in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> with a population of 459,300. The wider district has the 10th-largest population in England. The urban area population of 724,000 is the 8th-largest in the UK. The city borders <a href="North%20Somerset">North Somerset</a> and <a href="South%20Gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a>, with the cities of <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> and <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> to the south-east and north-east, respectively. <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> lies across the <a href="Severn%20estuary">Severn estuary</a>.

<a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s and <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a>s were built near the confluence of the rivers <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Bristol">Frome</a> and <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">Avon</a>, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (<a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "the place at the bridge"). Bristol received a <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> in 1155 and was <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historically</a> divided between <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> and <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> until 1373, when it became a <a href="county%20corporate">county of itself</a>. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after <a href="London">London</a> in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.

Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a>, a <a href="Venice">Venetian</a>, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 <a href="William%20Weston%20%28explorer%29">William Weston</a>, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the <a href="Bristol%20slave%20trade">Bristol slave trade</a>, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The <a href="Port%20of%20Bristol">Port of Bristol</a> has since moved from <a href="Bristol%20Harbour">Bristol Harbour</a> in the city centre to the <a href="Severn%20Estuary">Severn Estuary</a> at <a href="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> and <a href="Royal%20Portbury%20Dock">Royal Portbury Dock</a>.

Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the UK—the <a href="Bristol%20pound">Bristol pound</a>, which is <a href="Fixed%20exchange-rate%20system">pegged</a> to the <a href="Pound%20sterling">Pound sterling</a>. The city has two universities, the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20of%20England">University of the West of England</a>, and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the <a href="Royal%20West%20of%20England%20Academy">Royal West of England Academy</a>, the <a href="Arnolfini">Arnolfini</a>, <a href="Spike%20Island%2C%20Bristol">Spike Island</a>, <a href="Ashton%20Gate%20Stadium">Ashton Gate</a> and the <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Bristol%29">Memorial Stadium</a>. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road and rail, and to the world by sea and air: road, by the <a href="M5%20motorway">M5</a> and <a href="M4%20motorway">M4</a> (which connect to the city centre by the <a href="Portway%2C%20Bristol">Portway</a> and <a href="M32%20motorway">M32</a>); rail, via <a href="Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station">Bristol Temple Meads</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Parkway%20railway%20station">Bristol Parkway</a> mainline rail stations; and <a href="Bristol%20Airport">Bristol Airport</a>.

One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers <a href="Dorling%20Kindersley">Dorling Kindersley</a> in their "<a href="Eyewitness%20Books">Eyewitness</a>" series of travel guides. "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the <a href="European%20Union">EU's</a> <a href="European%20Green%20Capital%20Award">European Green Capital Award</a> in 2015.

The most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "Caer Odor" (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Bristol">River Frome</a> and <a href="Avon%20Gorge">Avon Gorge</a>. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name "Bricstow" was a simple <a href="calque">calque</a> of the existing <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Celtic</a> name, with "Bric" (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix "Stow" replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with <a href="Samuel%20Seyer">Samuel Seyer</a> enumerating 47 alternative forms.

The <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> form "Brycgstow" is commonly used to derive the meaning "place at the bridge". Utilizing another form, "Brastuile", Rev. Dr. Shaw derived the name from the <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Celtic</a> words "bras" (quick, rapid), or "braos" (a gap, chasm) and "tuile" (a stream). The poet <a href="Thomas%20Chatterton">Thomas Chatterton</a> popularised a derivation from "Brictricstow" linking the town to <a href="Brictric">Brictric</a>, the last king of Wessex. It appears that the form "Bricstow" prevailed until 1204, and the "<a href="Bristolian%20dialect">Bristolian 'L'</a>" (the tendency for the local dialect to add the sound "L" to many words ending in a neutral vowel) is what eventually changed the name to "Bristol".

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> finds, including flint tools believed to be between 300,000 and 126,000years old made with the <a href="Levallois%20technique">Levallois technique</a>, indicate the presence of <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a>s in the <a href="Shirehampton">Shirehampton</a> and <a href="Brislington%20West%20%28ward%29">St Annes</a> areas of Bristol during the <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Palaeolithic</a>. <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s near the city are at <a href="Leigh%20Woods%20National%20Nature%20Reserve">Leigh Woods</a> and <a href="Clifton%20Down">Clifton Down</a>, on the side of the <a href="Avon%20Gorge">Avon Gorge</a>, and on <a href="Kings%20Weston%20Hill">Kings Weston Hill</a> near <a href="Henbury">Henbury</a>. A <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> settlement, Abona, existed at what is now <a href="Sea%20Mills%2C%20Bristol">Sea Mills</a> (connected to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> by a <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman road</a>); another was at the present-day <a href="Filwood%20%28ward%29%23Inns%20Court">Inns Court</a>. Isolated <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a>s and small <a href="Castra">forts</a> and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.

Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a> producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified "<a href="burh">burh</a>", and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>'s sons. Under <a href="Normans">Norman</a> rule, the town had one of the strongest <a href="Bristol%20Castle">castles</a> in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for <a href="Diarmait%20Mac%20Murchada">Diarmait Mac Murchada</a>, the Irish <a href="king%20of%20Leinster">king of Leinster</a>, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding <a href="Richard%20Strongbow%20de%20Clare">Richard Strongbow de Clare</a> and the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland">Norman invasion of Ireland</a>.
The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Bristol">Rivers Frome</a> and <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">Avon</a>, adjacent to <a href="Bristol%20Bridge">Bristol Bridge</a> just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were <a href="Edict%20of%20Expulsion">expelled</a> from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a <a href="county%20corporate">county</a> in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, <a href="York">York</a> and <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> were England's largest <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

During the 15th century Bristol was the second-most important port in the country, trading with Ireland, Iceland and <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>. It was the starting point for many voyages, including <a href="Robert%20Sturmy">Robert Sturmy</a>'s (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade. New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a>, who in 1497 made landfall in North America. A 1499 voyage, led by merchant <a href="William%20Weston%20%28explorer%29">William Weston</a> of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America. During the first decade of the 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours. However, they seem to have lost interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.

During the 16th century, Bristol merchants concentrated on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies. This included the <a href="smuggling">smuggling</a> of prohibited goods, such as food and guns, to Iberia during the <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281585%E2%80%931604%29">Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)</a>. Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.
The original <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bristol">Diocese of Bristol</a> was founded in 1542, when the former <a href="Abbey">Abbey</a> of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">St. Augustine</a> (founded by <a href="Robert%20Fitzharding">Robert Fitzharding</a> four hundred years earlier) became <a href="Bristol%20Cathedral">Bristol Cathedral</a>. Bristol also gained <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city</a> status that year. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> in the 1640s <a href="Bristol%20in%20the%20English%20Civil%20War">the city</a> was occupied by <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a>, who built the <a href="Royal%20Fort%20House">Royal Fort House</a> on the site of an earlier <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> stronghold.

Growth of the city and trade came with the rise of England's <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">American colonies</a> in the 17th century. Bristol's location on the west side of Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic trade</a> in Africans taken for <a href="slavery">slavery</a> to the Americas. Bristol and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> became centres of the <a href="Triangular%20Trade">Triangular Trade</a>. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the <a href="Middle%20Passage">Middle Passage</a> under brutal conditions. In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic. Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The <a href="Somersett%20Case">Somersett Case</a> of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England. At the height of the <a href="Bristol%20slave%20trade">Bristol slave trade</a> from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The <a href="Seven%20Stars%2C%20Bristol">Seven Stars</a> <a href="pub">public house</a>, where <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolitionist</a> <a href="Thomas%20Clarkson">Thomas Clarkson</a> collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.

Fishermen from Bristol, who had fished the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Grand Banks of Newfoundland</a> since the 16th century, began settling Newfoundland permanently in larger numbers during the 17th century, establishing colonies at <a href="Bristol%27s%20Hope">Bristol's Hope</a> and <a href="Cuper%27s%20Cove">Cuper's Cove</a>. Because of Bristol's nautical environment, maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century, <a href="Samuel%20Plimsoll">Samuel Plimsoll</a>, known as "the sailor's friend," campaigned to make the seas safer; shocked by overloaded vessels, he successfully fought for a compulsory <a href="Waterline">load line</a> on ships.

In 1739 <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> founded the first <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> chapel, the <a href="New%20Room%2C%20Bristol">New Room</a>, in Bristol. Wesley, along with his brother <a href="Charles%20Wesley">Charles Wesley</a> and <a href="George%20Whitefield">George Whitefield</a>, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the neighbouring village of <a href="Kingswood%2C%20South%20Gloucestershire">Kingswood</a>, often in the open air.

The city was associated with Victorian engineer <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>, who designed the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> between Bristol and <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">London Paddington</a>, two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing <a href="Steamboat">steamships</a> ( and ), and the <a href="Clifton%20Suspension%20Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>. The new railway replaced the <a href="Kennet%20and%20Avon%20Canal">Kennet and Avon Canal</a>, which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London. Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a> and the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28region%29">West Midlands</a>. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a <a href="Bristol%20Harbour">floating harbour</a> designed by <a href="William%20Jessop">William Jessop</a> was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.

By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over from reaching the harbour, resulting in falling trade. The port facilities were migrating downstream to <a href="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> and new industrial complexes were founded there. Some of the traditional industries including copper and brass manufacture went into decline, but the import and processing of <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> flourished with the expansion of the <a href="W.D.%20%26amp%3B%20H.O.%20Wills">W.D. & H.O. Wills</a> business.

Supported by new industry and growing commerce, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801), quintupled during the 19th century, resulting in the creation of new suburbs such as <a href="Clifton%2C%20Bristol">Clifton</a> and <a href="Cotham%2C%20Bristol">Cotham</a>. These provide architectural examples from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="Gothic%20revival">gothic</a> style appeared, partially as a reaction against the <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> of <a href="Palladianism">Palladianism</a>, and can be seen in buildings such as the <a href="Bristol%20City%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery</a>, the <a href="Royal%20West%20of%20England%20Academy">Royal West of England Academy</a>, and <a href="The%20Victoria%20Rooms">The Victoria Rooms</a>. <a href="Bristol%20riots">Riots</a> broke out in 1793 and 1831; the first over the renewal of <a href="toll%20road">tolls</a> on Bristol Bridge, and the second against the rejection of the second <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Bill</a> by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. The Diocese of Bristol had undergone several boundary changes by 1897 when it was "reconstituted" into the configuration which has lasted into the 21st century.

From a population of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971. Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock. Another new dock, the <a href="Royal%20Portbury%20Dock">Royal Portbury Dock</a>, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s. As air travel grew in the first half of the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories. The unsuccessful <a href="Bristol%20International%20Exhibition">Bristol International Exhibition</a> was held on Ashton Meadows in the <a href="Bower%20Ashton">Bower Ashton</a> area in 1914. After the premature closure of the exhibition the site was used, until 1919, as <a href="barracks">barracks</a> for the <a href="Gloucestershire%20Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

<a href="Bristol%20Blitz">Bristol was heavily damaged by Luftwaffe raids</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; about 1,300 people living or working in the city were killed and nearly 100,000 buildings were damaged, at least 3,000 beyond repair. The original central shopping area, near the bridge and castle, <a href="Castle%20Park%2C%20Bristol">is now a park</a> containing two bombed churches and fragments of the castle. A third bomb-damaged church nearby, <a href="St%20Nicholas%2C%20Bristol">St Nicholas</a>, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> <a href="triptych">triptych</a> painted for the high altar of <a href="St%20Mary%20Redcliffe">St Mary Redcliffe</a>. The museum also has statues of <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">King Edward I</a> (moved from <a href="Arno%27s%20Court%20Triumphal%20Arch">Arno's Court Triumphal Arch</a>) and <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">King Edward III</a> (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester</a> (builder of <a href="Bristol%20Castle">Bristol Castle</a>) and <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Montbray">Geoffrey de Montbray</a> (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.

The rebuilding of <a href="Bristol%20city%20centre">Bristol city centre</a> was characterised by 1960s and 1970s <a href="skyscraper">skyscraper</a>s, <a href="mid-century%20modern">mid-century modern</a> architecture and <a href="20th%20Century%20Road%20Schemes%20in%20Bristol">road improvements</a>. Beginning in the 1980s some <a href="20th%20Century%20Road%20Schemes%20in%20Bristol%23Queen%20Square%2C%20Redcliffe%20Way%20and%20The%20Centre">main roads were closed</a>, the <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian-era</a> <a href="Queen%20Square%2C%20Bristol">Queen Square</a> and <a href="Portland%20Square%2C%20Bristol">Portland Square</a> were restored, the <a href="Broadmead">Broadmead</a> shopping area regenerated, and one of the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished. Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the <a href="M4%20motorway">M4</a> and <a href="M5%20motorway">M5 motorway</a>s, which meet at the <a href="Almondsbury%20Interchange">Almondsbury Interchange</a> just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a> (M4 westbound across the <a href="Severn%20Estuary">Severn Estuary</a>), <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> (M5 southbound) and <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> (M5 northbound). Bristol was bombed twice by the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">IRA</a>, in <a href="1974%20Bristol%20bombing">1974</a> and again in <a href="List%20of%20terrorist%20incidents%20in%20Great%20Britain%231970s">1978</a>.

The 20th-century relocation of the docks to <a href="Avonmouth%20Docks">Avonmouth Docks</a> and <a href="Royal%20Portbury%20Dock">Royal Portbury Dock</a>, downstream from the city centre, has allowed the redevelopment of the old dock area (the Floating Harbour). Although the docks' existence was once in jeopardy (since the area was seen as a derelict industrial site), the inaugural 1996 <a href="International%20Festival%20of%20the%20Sea%2C%201996">International Festival of the Sea</a> held in and around the docks affirmed the area as a leisure asset of the city.

Bristol City council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards, with between one and three per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three years out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election. Although the council was long dominated by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> have grown strong in the city and (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the <a href="2005%20UK%20general%20election">2005 UK general election</a>. In 2007, Labour and the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.

In February 2009, the Labour group resigned and the Liberal Democrats re-entered office with a minority administration. In the June <a href="Bristol%20City%20Council%20election%2C%202009">2009 council elections</a> the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council. In <a href="Bristol%20City%20Council%20election%2C%202010">2010</a> they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6. In 2011, they lost their majority; leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which a third of the city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7seats and the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20%26amp%3B%20Wales">Green Party</a> doubled their seats from 2to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.

These trends were continued into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three seats to take their total to 31, the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party</a> won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UKIP</a> won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.

On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum on the question of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate <a href="George%20Ferguson%20%28Mayor%20of%20Bristol%29">George Ferguson</a> became <a href="Mayor%20of%20Bristol">Mayor of Bristol</a>.

The Lord Mayor of Bristol, not to be confused with the Mayor of Bristol, is a figurehead elected each May by the city council. Councillor Faruk Choudhury was selected by his fellow councillors for the position in 2013. At 38, he was the youngest person to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol and the first Muslim elected to the office.

Bristol constituencies in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> also included parts of other local authority areas until the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010%20%28Bristol%29">2010 general election</a>, when their boundaries were aligned with the county boundary. The city is divided into Bristol <a href="Bristol%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West</a>, <a href="Bristol%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">East</a>, <a href="Bristol%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South</a> and <a href="Bristol%20North%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North West</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">2017 general election</a>, Labour won all four of the Bristol constituencies, gaining the Bristol North West seat, seven years after losing it to the Conservatives.

The city has a tradition of political activism. <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>, MP for the <a href="Bristol%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bristol constituency</a> for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that he was a Member of Parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second. Women's-rights advocate <a href="Emmeline%20Pethick-Lawrence%2C%20Baroness%20Pethick-Lawrence">Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence</a> (1867–1954) was born in Bristol, and the <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-winger</a><a href="Tony%20Benn">Tony Benn</a> served as MP for <a href="Bristol%20South%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bristol South East</a> in 1950–1960 and again from 1963–83. In 1963 the <a href="Bristol%20Bus%20Boycott">Bristol Bus Boycott</a>, following the <a href="Bristol%20Omnibus%20Company">Bristol Omnibus Company</a>'s refusal to hire Black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 <a href="Race%20Relations%20Act%201965">Race Relations Act</a>. The <a href="1980%20St.%20Pauls%20riot">1980 St. Pauls riot</a> protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the socioeconomic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of <a href="fair%20trade">fair trade</a> was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a <a href="Fairtrade%20Town">fairtrade zone</a>.

Bristol is both a city and a county, since <a href="King%20Edward%20III">King Edward III</a> granted it a county charter in 1373. The county was expanded in 1835 to include suburbs such as <a href="Clifton%2C%20Bristol">Clifton</a>, and it was named a <a href="county%20borough">county borough</a> in 1889 when that designation was introduced.

On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of <a href="Avon%20%28county%29">Avon</a>. On 1 April 1996, Avon was abolished and Bristol became a <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary authority</a>.

The former Avon area, called <a href="Greater%20Bristol">Greater Bristol</a> by the Government Office of the South West (now abolished) and others, refers to the city and the three neighbouring local authorities<a href="Bath%20and%20North%20East%20Somerset">Bath and North East Somerset</a>, <a href="North%20Somerset">North Somerset</a> and <a href="South%20Gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a> previously in Avon.

The <a href="North%20Fringe%20of%20Bristol">North Fringe of Bristol</a>, a developed area between the Bristol city boundary and the M4, M5 and M32 motorways (now in South Gloucestershire) was so named as part of a 1987 <a href="local%20plan">plan</a> prepared by the <a href="Northavon">Northavon</a> District Council of Avon county.

The <a href="West%20of%20England%20Combined%20Authority">West of England Combined Authority</a> was created on 9 February 2017. Covering Bristol and the rest of the old Avon county with the exception of North Somerset, the new <a href="combined%20authority">combined authority</a> has responsibility for regional planning, roads, and local transport, and to a lesser extent, education and business investment. The authority's first <a href="Mayor%20of%20the%20West%20of%20England">mayor</a>, <a href="Tim%20Bowles%20%28politician%29">Tim Bowles</a>, was elected in May 2017. One of the first actions of the new authority was the announcement of a new train station to be build at <a href="Portway%2C%20Bristol">Portway</a>.

Bristol's boundaries are defined in several ways, depending on whether they are those of the city, the developed area, or <a href="Greater%20Bristol">Greater Bristol</a>. The narrowest definition of the city is the <a href="Politics%20of%20Bristol">city council</a> boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of <a href="Steep%20Holm">Steep Holm</a> and <a href="Flat%20Holm">Flat Holm</a>.

The <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) has defined a <a href="Bristol%20Urban%20Area">Bristol Urban Area</a>, which includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as <a href="Kingswood%2C%20South%20Gloucestershire">Kingswood</a>, <a href="Mangotsfield">Mangotsfield</a>, <a href="Stoke%20Gifford">Stoke Gifford</a>, <a href="Winterbourne%2C%20Gloucestershire">Winterbourne</a>, <a href="Almondsbury">Almondsbury</a>, <a href="Easton%20in%20Gordano">Easton in Gordano</a>, <a href="Whitchurch%2C%20Bristol">Whitchurch</a> village, <a href="Filton">Filton</a>, <a href="Patchway">Patchway</a> and <a href="Bradley%20Stoke">Bradley Stoke</a>, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.

Bristol is part of a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> area running from the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a> in the south to the <a href="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome cut through the limestone to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through <a href="Floodplain">flood plains</a> and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">last ice age</a>.<ref name="10.1144/GSL"></ref>

The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as <a href="The%20Downs%2C%20Bristol">The Downs</a> and Leigh Woods. The Avon <a href="estuary">estuary</a> and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at <a href="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>. Another gorge, cut by the <a href="Hazel%20Brook">Hazel Brook</a> (which flows into the <a href="River%20Trym">River Trym</a>), crosses the <a href="Blaise%20Castle">Blaise Castle</a> estate in northern Bristol.

Bristol is often described, by its inhabitants, as being built on seven hills. Given the local geography of Bristol this is easily the case. To name but a few, Red Lion Hill, Barton Hill, Lawrence Hill, St. Michaels Hill, Black Boy Hill, Constitution Hill, Staple Hill, Brandon Hill, Windmill Hill, Malborough Hill, Nine Tree Hill, Talbot, Brook Hill and Granby Hill.

Bristol is west of London and south-southwest of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and east of the Welsh capital <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>.

The climate is <a href="Oceanic%20climate">oceanic</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a>: "Cfb)", milder than most places in <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Located in southern England, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK with a mean annual temperature of approximately . It is among the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885hours of sunshine per year. Although the city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, it is exposed to the Severn Estuary and the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a>. Annual rainfall increases from north to south, with totals north of the Avon in the range and south of the river. Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with autumn and winter the wetter seasons. The Atlantic Ocean influences Bristol's weather, keeping its average temperature above freezing throughout the year, but winter frosts are frequent and snow occasionally falls from early November to late April. Summers are warm and drier, with variable sunshine, rain and clouds, and spring weather is unsettled.

The weather stations nearest Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about south west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station, in the city centre. Data collection at these locations ended in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and Filton Airfield is currently the nearest weather station to the city. Temperatures at Long Ashton from 1959 to 2002 ranged from in July 1976 to in January 1982. Monthly high temperatures since 2002 at Filton exceeding those recorded at Long Ashton include in April 2003, in July 2006 and in October 2011. The lowest recent temperature at Filton was in December 2010. Although large cities in general experience an <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effect, with warmer temperatures than their surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon is minimal in Bristol.

Bristol was ranked as Britain's most sustainable city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, <a href="Future%20proof">future-proofing</a> and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity <a href="Forum%20for%20the%20Future">Forum for the Future</a>'s 2008 <a href="Sustainable%20city">Sustainable Cities</a> Index. Local initiatives include <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a> (creators of the <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a>, founded as Cyclebag in 1977) and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth. In 2014 "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" named it as the best city in Britain in which to live. The city received the 2015 <a href="European%20Green%20Capital%20Award">European Green Capital Award</a>, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.

The city has green belt mainly along its southern fringes, taking in small areas within the <a href="Ashton%20Court">Ashton Court Estate</a>, South Bristol crematorium and cemetery, High Ridge common and Whitchurch, with a further area around Frenchay Farm. The belt extends outside the city boundaries into surrounding counties and districts, for several miles in places, to afford a protection from urban sprawl to surrounding villages and towns.

In 2014, the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> estimated the <a href="Unitary%20authorities%20of%20England">Bristol unitary authority's</a> population at 442,474, making it the <a href="List%20of%20ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">43rd-largest</a> <a href="Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">ceremonial county</a> in England. The ONS, using <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">Census 2001</a> data, estimated the city's population at 441,556.

According to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 census</a>, 84% of the population was <a href="White%20people">White</a> (77.9% <a href="White%20British">White British</a>, 0.9% <a href="Irish%20migration%20to%20Great%20Britain">White Irish</a>, 0.1% <a href="Gypsy%20%28term%29">Gypsy</a> or <a href="Irish%20Travellers">Irish Travellers</a> and 5.1% <a href="Other%20White">Other White</a>); 3.6% <a href="Mixed%20%28United%20Kingdom%20ethnicity%20category%29">mixed-race</a> (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% <a href="British%20Asian">Asian</a> (1.6% <a href="British%20Pakistanis">Pakistani</a>, 1.5% <a href="British%20Indian">Indian</a>, 0.9% <a href="British%20Chinese">Chinese</a>, 0.5% <a href="British%20Bangladeshi">Bangladeshi</a>, and 1% other Asian); 6% <a href="Black%20British">Black</a> (2.8% African, 1.6% <a href="British%20African-Caribbean%20people">Caribbean</a>, 1.6% <a href="Other%20Black">Other Black</a>), 0.3% <a href="British%20Arabs">Arab</a> and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population. These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset—such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley. 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or taxi, 2.2% commute by rail and 9.8% by bus, while 19.6% walk.

The population of <a href="Bristol%20Urban%20Area">Bristol's contiguous urban area</a> was put at 551,066 by the ONS based on Census 2001 data. In 2006 the ONS estimated Bristol's urban-area population at 587,400, making it England's sixth-most populous city and tenth-most populous urban area.
At it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district. According to data from 2015, the urban area has the 8th-largest population in the UK with a daytime population of 724,000.

In 2007 the <a href="European%20Spatial%20Planning%20Observation%20Network">European Spatial Planning Observation Network</a> (ESPON) defined Bristol's <a href="functional%20urban%20area">functional urban area</a> as including Weston-super-Mare, Bath and Clevedon with a total population of 1.04 million, the twelfth largest of the UK.

Bristol has a long history of trade, originally exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, <a href="produce">produce</a> and petroleum products. Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.

Ships occasionally departed Bristol for <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> as early as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> or John Cabot. Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol <a href="Society%20of%20Merchant%20Venturers">Society of Merchant Venturers</a> sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities. In 1552, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> granted a <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were <a href="Martin%20Frobisher">Martin Frobisher</a>, <a href="Thomas%20James%20%28sea%20captain%29">Thomas James</a>, after whom <a href="James%20Bay">James Bay</a>, on southern coast of <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> is named and <a href="Martin%20Pring">Martin Pring</a>, who discovered <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> and the southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast in 1603.

By 1670 the city had 6,000tons of shipping (of which half was imported tobacco), and by the late 17th and early 18th centuries shipping played a significant role in the <a href="History%20of%20slavery">slave trade</a>. During the 18th century, Bristol was Britain's second-busiest port; business was conducted in the trading area around <a href="The%20Exchange%2C%20Bristol">The Exchange</a> in <a href="Corn%20Street">Corn Street</a> over bronze tables known as <a href="Bristol%20nail">Nails</a>. Although the Nails are cited as originating the phrase "cash on the nail" (immediate payment), the phrase was probably in use before their installation.

The city's economy also relies on the <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a>, defence, media, information technology, financial services and tourism industries. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later known as the <a href="Defence%20Procurement%20Agency">Defence Procurement Agency</a> and <a href="Defence%20Equipment%20and%20Support">Defence Equipment and Support</a>, moved to its headquarters to Abbey Wood, Filton, in 1995. This organisation, with a staff of 12,000 to 13,000, procures and supports MoD equipment. One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top-ten cities by international travel publishers <a href="Dorling%20Kindersley">Dorling Kindersley</a> in their "<a href="Eyewitness%20Books">Eyewitness</a>" guides for young adults.

Bristol is one of the eight-largest regional English cities that make up the <a href="Core%20Cities%20Group">Core Cities Group</a>, and is ranked as a <a href="gamma%20world%20city">gamma world city</a> by the <a href="Globalization%20and%20World%20Cities%20Research%20Network">Globalization and World Cities Research Network</a>, the fourth-highest-ranked English city. In 2017 Bristol's <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> was £88.448billion. Its <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a> GDP was £46,000 ($65,106, €57,794), which was some 65% above the national average, the third-highest of any English city (after London and <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>) and the sixth-highest of any city in the United Kingdom (behind London, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Glasgow, <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and Nottingham). According to the 2011 census, Bristol's unemployment rate (claiming <a href="Jobseeker%27s%20Allowance">Jobseeker's Allowance</a>) was three per cent, compared with two per cent for <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> and the national average of four per cent.

Although Bristol's economy no longer relies upon its <a href="Port%20of%20Bristol">port</a>, which was moved to docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, it is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9million long tons (4million tonnes) to 11.8million (12million). Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.

The financial services sector employs 59,000 in the city, and 50 micro-electronics and silicon design companies employ about 5,000. In 1983 <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> opened its national research laboratory in Bristol. In 2014 the city was ranked seventh in the "top 10 UK destinations" by <a href="TripAdvisor">TripAdvisor</a>.

During the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at Filton by the <a href="Bristol%20Aeroplane%20Company">Bristol Aeroplane Company</a> and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Holdings">Rolls-Royce</a>) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighter</a> and World War II <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Blenheim</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Beaufighter</a> planes. During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the <a href="Bristol%20Freighter">Freighter</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Britannia">Britannia</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Brabazon">Brabazon</a>. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, <a href="Luxury%20vehicle">luxury</a> <a href="Bristol%20Cars">Bristol Cars</a> at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960. The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by <a href="Bristol%20Commercial%20Vehicles">Bristol Commercial Vehicles</a>.
Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> supersonic airliner project during the 1960s. The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to <a href="RAF%20Fairford">RAF Fairford</a> on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight. In 2003 <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> and <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a> decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide.

During the mid-19th century <a href="Bristol%20Byzantine">Bristol Byzantine</a>, a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most <a href="History%20of%20architecture">architectural periods</a> of the United Kingdom can be seen in the city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period, and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.

The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. <a href="St%20James%27%20Priory%2C%20Bristol">St James' Priory</a> was founded in 1129 as a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> priory by Earl <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert</a> of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>. The second-oldest is Bristol Cathedral and its associated <a href="The%20Great%20Gatehouse">Great Gatehouse</a>. Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the <a href="bishop">bishop</a> and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around <a href="Dundry">Dundry</a> and <a href="Felton%2C%20Somerset">Felton</a> with <a href="Bath%20stone">Bath stone</a> being used in other areas. Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th-century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20I">Queen Elizabeth I</a> as "the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England."

Secular buildings include The Red Lodge, built in 1580 for John Yonge as a <a href="gatehouse">lodge</a> for a larger house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> times and restored in the early 20th century. <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Bristol">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by <a href="Earl%20De%20La%20Warr">Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr</a> (), and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel. Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. <a href="St%20Nicholas%27s%20Almshouses">St Nicholas's Almshouses</a> were built in 1652 to provide care for the poor.

Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square and the complex of small cottages around a green at <a href="Blaise%20Hamlet">Blaise Hamlet</a>, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> <a href="banking">banker</a> and <a href="philanthropy">philanthropist</a> <a href="John%20Scandrett%20Harford">John Scandrett Harford</a>, who owned Blaise Castle House. The 18th-century <a href="Kings%20Weston%20House">Kings Weston House</a>, in northern Bristol, was designed by <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. <a href="Almshouse">Almshouse</a>s and pubs from the same period intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian <a href="Garden%20square">squares</a> were designed for the middle class as prosperity increased during the 18th century. During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the <a href="Bristol%20Blitz">Bristol Blitz</a>.

The club played at the <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Bristol%29">Memorial Ground</a>, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers.

Bristol is home to <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> video developers and stylists <a href="The%20Yogscast">The Yogscast</a>, with founders Simon Lane and Lewis Brindley moving their operations from <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> to Bristol in 2012.

A dialect of English (<a href="West%20Country%20English">West Country English</a>), known as Bristolian, Bristolese, Brizzle or Bristle (after the publication of Derek Robson's "Krek Waiters peak Bristle") is spoken by longtime residents, who are known as Bristolians. Bristol natives have a <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">rhotic accent</a>, in which the post-vocalic "r" in "car" and "card" is pronounced (unlike in <a href="Received%20Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a>). The unique feature of this accent is the "Bristol (or terminal) l", in which "l" is appended to words ending in "a" or "o". Whether this is a broad "l" or a "w" is a subject of debate, with "area" pronounced "areal" or "areaw". The ending of "Bristol" is another example of the Bristol "l". Bristolians pronounce "-a" and "-o" at the end of a word as "-aw" ("cinemaw"). To non-natives, the pronunciation suggests an "l" after the vowel.

Until recently Bristolese was characterised by retention of the second-person singular, as in the <a href="doggerel">doggerel</a> "Cassn't see what bist looking at? Cassn't see as well as couldst, casst? And if couldst, 'ouldn't, 'ouldst?" The West Saxon "bist" is used for the English "art", and children were admonished with "Thee and thou, the Welshman's cow". In Bristolese, as in French and German, the second-person singular was not used when speaking to a superior (except by the egalitarian <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a>). The pronoun "thee" is also used in the subject position ("What bist thee doing?"), and "I" or "he" in the object position ("Give he to I."). Linguist <a href="Stanley%20Ellis%20%28linguist%29">Stanley Ellis</a>, who found that many dialect words in the Filton area were linked to aerospace work, described Bristolese as "a cranky, crazy, crab-apple tree of language and with the sharpest, juiciest flavour that I've heard for a long time".

In the 2011 United Kingdom census, 46.8% of Bristol's population identified as <a href="Christians">Christian</a> and 37.4% said they were not religious; the English averages were 59.4% and 24.7%, respectively. <a href="Islam">Islam</a> is observed by 5.1% of the population, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> by 0.6%, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> by 0.6%, <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> by 0.5%, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> by 0.2% and other religions 0.7%; 8.1% did not identify with a religion.

Bristol has several <a href="List%20of%20churches%20in%20Bristol">Christian churches</a>; the most notable are the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> Bristol Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe and the Roman Catholic <a href="Clifton%20Cathedral">Clifton Cathedral</a>. <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a> chapels include <a href="Buckingham%20Baptist%20Chapel">Buckingham Baptist Chapel</a> and John Wesley's New Room in Broadmead. After <a href="St%20James%27%20Presbyterian%20Church%20of%20England%2C%20Bristol">St James' Presbyterian Church</a> was <a href="The%20Blitz">bombed</a> on 24 November 1940, it was never again used as a church; although its <a href="bell%20tower">bell tower</a> remains, its <a href="nave">nave</a> was converted into offices. The city has eleven mosques, several Buddhist meditation centres, a <a href="Hindu%20temple">Hindu temple</a>, <a href="Movement%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> and Orthodox-Jewish synagogues and four <a href="Gurdwara">Sikh temples</a>.

Bristol has been awarded Purple Flag status on many of its districts which shows that it meets or surpasses the standards of excellence in managing the evening and night-time economy. 

DJ Mag's top 100 club list ranked Motion as the 19th-best club in the world in 2016.  This is up 5 spots from 2015. Motion is host to some of the world's top DJs, and leading producers. Motion is a complex made up of different rooms, outdoor space and a terrace that looks over the river Avon. In 2011 Motion was transformed from a skate park, into the rave spot it is today. In:Motion is an annual series which takes place each autumn and delivers 12 weeks of music and dancing.

The Attic Bar is a venue located in <a href="Stokes%20Croft">Stokes Croft</a>.  Equipped with a sound system and stage which are used every weekend for gigs of every genre, the bar and the connected Full Moon Pub were rated by "The Guardian", a British daily paper, as one of the top ten clubs in the UK. Located by Bristol's harbourside, The Apple is a cider bar located by Bristol's harbour side which opened in 2004, in a converted <a href="Dutch%20barge">Dutch barge</a>, offering a range of 40 different ciders.  In 2014, the Great British Pub Awards ranked The Apple as the best cider bar in the UK. Bristol is also home to the pie chain Pieminster started in the Stokes Croft area of the city.

Bristol has two major institutions of higher education: the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, a <a href="Red%20brick%20university">redbrick</a> chartered in 1909, and the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20of%20England">University of the West of England</a>, opened as Bristol <a href="Institute%20of%20technology">Polytechnic</a> in 1969, it became a university in 1992. <a href="The%20University%20of%20Law">The University of Law</a> also has a campus in the city. Bristol has two <a href="further%20education">further education</a> institutions (<a href="City%20of%20Bristol%20College">City of Bristol College</a> and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College) and two <a href="Theology">theological</a> colleges: <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Bristol">Trinity College</a>, and <a href="Baptists%20Together">Bristol Baptist College</a>. The city has 129 <a href="Infant%20school">infant</a>, <a href="Junior%20school">junior</a> and primary schools,
<a href="List%20of%20schools%20in%20Bristol">17 secondary schools</a>, and three learning centres. After a section of north London, Bristol has England's second-highest number of <a href="Independent%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">independent school</a> places.

In 2005 <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> Gordon Brown named Bristol one of six English "science cities",
and a £300million science park was planned at <a href="Emersons%20Green">Emersons Green</a>. Research is conducted at the two universities, the <a href="Bristol%20Royal%20Infirmary">Bristol Royal Infirmary</a> and <a href="Southmead%20Hospital">Southmead Hospital</a>, and science outreach is practiced at <a href="We%20The%20Curious">We The Curious</a>, the Bristol Zoo, the <a href="Bristol%20Festival%20of%20Nature">Bristol Festival of Nature</a> and the Create Centre.

The city has produced a number of scientists, including 19th-century chemist <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> (who worked in <a href="Hotwells">Hotwells</a>). Physicist <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> (from <a href="Bishopston%2C%20Bristol">Bishopston</a>) received the 1933 Nobel Prize for his contributions to <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. <a href="C.%20F.%20Powell">Cecil Frank Powell</a> was the Melvill Wills Professor of Physics at the University of Bristol when he received the 1950 Nobel Prize for, among other discoveries, his photographic method of studying nuclear processes. <a href="Colin%20Pillinger">Colin Pillinger</a> was the planetary scientist behind the <a href="Beagle%202">Beagle 2</a> project, and neuropsychologist <a href="Richard%20Gregory">Richard Gregory</a> founded the Exploratory (a hands-on science centre which was the predecessor of At-Bristol/We The Curious).

Initiatives such as the <a href="Flying%20Start%20Challenge">Flying Start Challenge</a> encourage an interest in science and engineering in Bristol secondary-school pupils; links with aerospace companies impart technical information and advance student understanding of design.
The <a href="Bloodhound%20SSC">Bloodhound SSC</a> project to break the <a href="land%20speed%20record">land speed record</a> is based at the Bloodhound Technology Centre on the city's harbourside.

Bristol has two principal railway stations. <a href="Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station">Bristol Temple Meads</a> (near the city centre) has <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Great Western Railway</a> services which include high-speed trains to <a href="Paddington%20railway%20station">London Paddington</a> and local, regional and <a href="CrossCountry">CrossCountry</a> trains. <a href="Bristol%20Parkway%20railway%20station">Bristol Parkway</a>, north of the city centre, has high-speed Great Western Railway services to <a href="Swansea%20railway%20station">Swansea</a>, <a href="Cardiff%20Central%20railway%20station">Cardiff Central</a> and London Paddington and CrossCountry services to <a href="Birmingham%20New%20Street%20railway%20station">Birmingham</a> and the <a href="North%20East%20England">North East</a>. Limited service to <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">London Waterloo</a> via <a href="Clapham%20Junction%20railway%20station">Clapham Junction</a> from Bristol Temple Meads is operated by <a href="South%20Western%20Railway%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">South Western Railway</a>, and there are scheduled coach links to most major UK cities.
Bristol's principal surviving suburban railway is the <a href="Severn%20Beach%20Line">Severn Beach Line</a> to Avonmouth and <a href="Severn%20Beach">Severn Beach</a>. Although <a href="Portishead%20Railway">Portishead Railway's</a> passenger service was a casualty of the <a href="Beeching%20cuts">Beeching cuts</a>, freight service to the Royal Portbury Dock was restored from 2000 to 2002 with a <a href="Strategic%20Rail%20Authority">Strategic Rail Authority</a> rail-freight grant. The <a href="MetroWest%20%28Bristol%29">MetroWest</a> scheme, formerly known as The Greater Bristol Metro, proposes to increase the city's rail capacity and is scheduled for completion by 2019. A further scheme to restore a further of track on the <a href="Portishead%20Railway">line</a> to <a href="Portishead%2C%20Somerset">Portishead</a> (a <a href="Commuter%20town">dormitory town</a> with one connecting road), is due to open in 2021. A further commuter rail line from <a href="Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station">Bristol Temple Meads</a> to <a href="Henbury">Henbury</a> is due to open in 2021.

The M4 motorway connects the city on an east-west axis from London to <a href="West%20Wales">West Wales</a>, and the M5 is a north–south west axis from Birmingham to Exeter. The <a href="M49%20motorway">M49 motorway</a> is a shortcut between the M5 in the south and the M4 <a href="Second%20Severn%20Crossing">Severn Crossing</a> in the west, and the <a href="M32%20motorway">M32</a> is a spur from the M4 to the city centre. The <a href="Portway%2C%20Bristol">Portway</a> connects the M5 to the city centre, and was the most expensive road in Britain when opened in 1926.

As of 2019, Bristol is working on plans for a Clean Air Zone to reduce pollution, which could involve charging the most polluting vehcles to enter the city centre.

Several road-construction plans, including re-routing and improving the <a href="South%20Bristol%20%28UK%29">South Bristol</a> <a href="A4174%20road">Ring Road</a>, are supported by the city council.

Private car use is high in the city, leading to traffic congestion costing an estimated £350million per year.
Bristol allows motorcycles to use most of the city's bus lanes and provides secure, free parking for them.

Public transport in the city consists primarily of a <a href="First%20West%20of%20England">First West of England</a> <a href="Buses%20in%20Bristol">bus network</a>. Other providers are Abus, <a href="Stagecoach%20West">Stagecoach West</a>, <a href="Stagecoach%20South%20West">Stagecoach South West</a> and <a href="Wessex%20Bus">Wessex Bus</a>. Bristol's bus service has been criticised as unreliable and expensive, and in 2005 FirstGroup was fined for delays and safety violations.

Although the city council has included a <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> system in its <a href="local%20transport%20plan">local transport plan</a> since 2000, it has not yet funded the project; Bristol was offered European Union funding for the system, but the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a> did not provide the required additional funding. The most recent light rail proposal was put forward as part of a consultation produced by the <a href="Local%20enterprise%20partnership">West of England Local Enterprise Partnership</a> in November 2016, outlining potential <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a>/<a href="tram">tram</a> routes from the <a href="Bristol%20city%20centre">city centre</a> to <a href="Bristol%20Airport">Bristol Airport</a>, the eastern and north west fringes of the city, and a route along the <a href="A4%20road%20%28England%29">A4 road</a> to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. In 2017, a further feasibility study will be undertaken into the possibility of an underground light rail system.

A new <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> system (BRT) called <a href="MetroBus%20%28Bristol%29">MetroBus</a>, is currently under construction across Bristol, as of 2018, to provide a faster and more reliable service than buses, improve transport infrastructure and reduce congestion. The MetroBus rapid transit scheme will run on both bus lanes and segregated <a href="guided%20busway">guided busway</a>s on three routes; <a href="North%20Fringe">North Fringe</a> to <a href="Hengrove">Hengrove</a> (route m1), <a href="Ashton%20Vale">Ashton Vale</a> to <a href="Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station">Bristol Temple Meads</a> (route m2), and <a href="Emersons%20Green">Emersons Green</a> to <a href="The%20Centre%2C%20Bristol">The Centre</a> (route m3). MetroBus services started in 2018.

Three <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> sites serve Bristol.
The city centre has water transport operated by <a href="Bristol%20Ferry%20Boats">Bristol Ferry Boats</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Packet%20Boat%20Trips">Bristol Packet Boat Trips</a> and Number Seven Boat Trips, providing leisure and commuter service in the harbour.

Bristol was designated as England's first "cycling city" in 2008 and is home to <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a>, the sustainable transport charity. The <a href="Bristol%20and%20Bath%20Railway%20Path">Bristol and Bath Railway Path</a> links it to Bath, and was the first part of the <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a>. The city also has urban cycle routes and links with National Cycle Network routes to The rest of the Country. Cycling trips increased by 21% from 2001 to 2005.

The runway, terminal and other facilities at <a href="Bristol%20Airport">Bristol Airport</a> (BRS), <a href="Lulsgate%20Plateau">Lulsgate</a>, have been upgraded since 2001.

Bristol was among the first cities to adopt <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">town twinning</a> after World War II. Twin towns include:

Magic Johnson

Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> player and current president of basketball operations of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). He played <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in <a href="High%20school%20basketball%23U.S.%20high%20school%20basketball">high school</a> and <a href="College%20basketball">college</a>, Johnson was selected first overall in the <a href="1979%20NBA%20draft">1979 NBA draft</a> by the Lakers. He won a championship and an <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award</a> in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, but returned to play in the <a href="1992%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1992 All-Star Game</a>, winning the <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star MVP Award</a>. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

Johnson's career achievements include three <a href="NBA%20MVP%20Awards">NBA MVP Awards</a>, nine <a href="NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a> appearances, twelve <a href="List%20of%20NBA%20All-Stars">All-Star</a> games, and ten <a href="All-NBA%20Team">All-NBA</a> First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assists</a> four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2. Johnson was a member of the <a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team</a> ("The Dream Team"), which won the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic</a> gold medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a <a href="barnstorm%20%28sports%29">barnstorming</a> team that travelled around the world playing <a href="exhibition%20game">exhibition game</a>s. Johnson was honored as one of the <a href="50%20Greatest%20Players%20in%20NBA%20History">50 Greatest Players in NBA History</a> in 1996.

Johnson became a two-time inductee into the <a href="Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Basketball Hall of Fame</a>—being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team". He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> in 2007. His friendship and rivalry with <a href="Boston%20Celtics">Boston Celtics</a> star <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a>, whom he faced in the <a href="1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1979 NCAA finals</a> and three NBA championship series, are well documented.

Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/<a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> prevention and <a href="safe%20sex">safe sex</a>, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster and motivational speaker. His public announcement of his HIV-positive status in 1991 helped dispel the stereotype, still widely held at the time, that <a href="Misconceptions%20about%20HIV/AIDS">HIV was a "gay disease"</a> that heterosexuals need not worry about; his bravery in making this announcement was widely commended. Named by "<a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>" magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009, Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years. Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in 2012 and the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Sparks">Los Angeles Sparks</a> in 2014.

Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>, the son of <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> assembly worker Earvin Sr. and school janitor Christine. Johnson, who had six siblings (and three half-siblings by his father's previous marriage), was influenced by his parents' strong work ethic. His mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Johnson would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him "Garbage Man".

Johnson came to love basketball as a youngster. His favorite basketball player was <a href="Bill%20Russell">Bill Russell</a>, whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability. He also idolized players such as <a href="Earl%20Monroe">Earl Monroe</a> and <a href="Marques%20Haynes">Marques Haynes</a>, and practiced "all day". Johnson came from an athletic family. His father played high school basketball in his home state of Mississippi, and Johnson learned the finer points about the game from him. Johnson's mother, originally from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, had also played basketball as a child, and she grew up watching her brothers play the game.

By the time he had reached the eighth grade, Johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball. He had become a dominant junior high player, once scoring 48 points in a game. Johnson looked forward to playing at <a href="J.%20W.%20Sexton%20High%20School">Sexton High School</a>, a school with a very successful basketball team and history that also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be <a href="Desegregation%20busing">bused</a> to the predominately white <a href="Everett%20High%20School%20%28Michigan%29">Everett High School</a> instead of going to Sexton, which was predominately black. Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg his brother not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball to him. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually, Johnson accepted his situation and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader. When recalling the events in his autobiography, "My Life", he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him:

Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Everett High School, when he recorded a <a href="triple-double">triple-double</a> of 36 <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">points</a>, 18 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a>, and 16 assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the "<a href="Lansing%20State%20Journal">Lansing State Journal</a>", gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious. In his final high school season, Johnson led Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a> victory in the state championship game. Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, who was killed in a car accident the previous summer. He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, saying years later, "I doubted myself back then." Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car. Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan and was also named to the 1977 <a href="McDonald%27s%20All-America">McDonald's All-America</a>n team.

Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as <a href="Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball">Indiana</a> and <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball">UCLA</a>, he decided to play close to home. His college decision came down to <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan</a> and <a href="Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan State</a> in <a href="East%20Lansing">East Lansing</a>. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach <a href="Jud%20Heathcote">Jud Heathcote</a> told him he could play the <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.

Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his <a href="communication%20studies">communication studies</a> <a href="Academic%20major">major</a> and on his desire to become a television commentator. Playing with future NBA draftees <a href="Greg%20Kelser">Greg Kelser</a>, <a href="Jay%20Vincent">Jay Vincent</a> and <a href="Mike%20Brkovich">Mike Brkovich</a>, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a <a href="First%20year">freshman</a>, and led the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Spartans</a> to a 25–5 record, the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a> title, and a berth in the <a href="1978%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1978 NCAA Tournament</a>. The Spartans reached the <a href="Elite%20Eight">Elite Eight</a>, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kentucky</a>.

During the <a href="1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1978–79 season</a>, Michigan State again qualified for the <a href="1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">NCAA Tournament</a>, where they advanced to the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">championship game</a> and faced <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Indiana%20State%20Sycamores%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Indiana State</a>, which was led by senior <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a>. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted <a href="NCAA%20Basketball%20Tournament%20Most%20Outstanding%20Player">Most Outstanding Player</a> of the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">Final Four</a>. He was selected to the <a href="1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">1978–79 All-American team</a> for his performance that season. After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.9 assists per game, Johnson entered the <a href="1979%20NBA%20draft">1979 NBA draft</a>. Jud Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans after the 1994–95 season, and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the <a href="Breslin%20Center">Breslin Center</a> to play in the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game. He led all scorers with 39 points.

Johnson was <a href="List%20of%20first%20overall%20NBA%20draft%20picks">drafted first overall</a> in 1979 by the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Los Angeles Lakers</a>. Johnson said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>, the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Lakers coach <a href="Jack%20McKinney%20%28basketball%29">Jack McKinney</a> had the rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play <a href="forward%20%28basketball%29">forward</a>, be a point guard, even though incumbent <a href="Norm%20Nixon">Norm Nixon</a> was already one of the best in the league. Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the <a href="NBA%20All-Rookie%20Team">NBA All-Rookie Team</a>, and was named an <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">NBA All-Star Game</a> starter.

The Lakers compiled a 60–22 record in the regular season and reached the <a href="1980%20NBA%20Finals">1980 NBA Finals</a>, in which they faced the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Philadelphia 76ers</a>, who were led by <a href="forward%20%28basketball%29">forward</a> <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a>. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33 points a game in the series, sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6. Coach <a href="Paul%20Westhead">Paul Westhead</a>, who had replaced McKinney early in the season after he suffered a near-fatal bicycle accident, decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 <a href="steal%20%28basketball%29">steals</a> in a 123–107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game. Johnson became the only rookie to win the <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA Finals MVP</a> award, and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history. He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years.

Early in the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NBA%20season">1980–81 season</a>, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> in his left knee. He missed 45 games, and said that his <a href="Physical%20therapy">rehabilitation</a> was the "most down" he had ever felt. Johnson returned before the start of the <a href="1981%20NBA%20Playoffs">1981 playoffs</a>, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach <a href="Pat%20Riley">Pat Riley</a> later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a "divided team". The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Houston%20Rockets%20season">Houston Rockets</a> in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson <a href="Air%20ball">airballed</a> a last-second shot in Game 3.

In 1981, after the 1980–81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. Early in the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20NBA%20season">1981–82 season</a>, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" and "predictable". After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner <a href="Jerry%20Buss">Jerry Buss</a> fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Laker fans. However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead–Johnson altercation, but assistant GM <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a> and GM <a href="Bill%20Sharman">Bill Sharman</a> had convinced Buss to delay his decision. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals per game, and was voted a member of the <a href="All-NBA">All-NBA</a> Second Team. He also joined <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a> as the only NBA players to tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season. The Lakers advanced through the <a href="1982%20NBA%20Playoffs">1982 playoffs</a> and faced <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Philadelphia</a> for the second time in three years in the <a href="1982%20NBA%20Finals">1982 NBA Finals</a>. After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4–2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award. During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2 points on .533 shooting, 10.8 rebounds, 8.0 assists, and 2.5 steals per game. Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley.

During the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NBA%20season">1982–83 NBA season</a>, Johnson averaged 16.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 8.6 rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination. The Lakers again reached the <a href="1983%20NBA%20Finals">Finals</a>, and for a third time faced the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Sixers</a>, who featured <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> <a href="Moses%20Malone">Moses Malone</a> as well as Erving. With Johnson's teammates Nixon, <a href="James%20Worthy">James Worthy</a>, and <a href="Bob%20McAdoo">Bob McAdoo</a> all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP. In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0 points on .403 shooting, 12.5 assists, and 7.8 rebounds per game.

Prior to Johnson's <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">fifth season</a>, West—who had become the Lakers general manager—traded Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling responsibilities. Johnson that season averaged a <a href="double-double">double-double</a> of 17.6 points and 13.1 assists, as well as 7.3 rebounds per game. The Lakers reached the <a href="1984%20NBA%20Finals">Finals</a> for the third year in a row, where Johnson's <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> and Bird's <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Celtics</a> met for the first time in the post-season. The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18 seconds to go, but after a <a href="layup">layup</a> by <a href="Gerald%20Henderson">Gerald Henderson</a>, Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime. In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21 assists in a 137–104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center <a href="Robert%20Parish">Robert Parish</a>, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard <a href="Dennis%20Johnson">Dennis Johnson</a> stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series. Friends <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a> and <a href="Mark%20Aguirre">Mark Aguirre</a> consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street. During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game. Johnson later described the series as "the one championship we should have had but didn't get".
In the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20NBA%20season">1984–85 regular season</a>, Johnson averaged 18.3 points, 12.6 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game and led the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> into the <a href="1985%20NBA%20Finals">1985 NBA Finals</a>, where they faced the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Celtics</a> again. The series started poorly for the Lakers when they allowed an NBA Finals record 148 points to the Celtics in a 34-point loss in Game 1. However, Abdul-Jabbar, who was now 38 years old, scored 30 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in Game 2, and his 36 points in a Game 5 win were instrumental in establishing a 3–2 lead for Los Angeles. After the Lakers defeated the Celtics in six games, Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, who averaged 18.3 points on .494 shooting, 14.0 assists, and 6.8 rebounds per game in the championship series, said the Finals win was the highlight of their careers.

Johnson again averaged a double-double in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NBA%20season">1985–86 NBA season</a>, with 18.8 points, 12.6 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game. The <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> advanced to the <a href="1986%20NBA%20Playoffs">Western Conference Finals</a>, but were unable to defeat the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Houston%20Rockets%20season">Houston Rockets</a>, who advanced to the Finals in five games. In the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20NBA%20season">next season</a>, Johnson averaged a career-high of 23.9 points, as well as 12.2 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game, and earned his first <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">regular season MVP award</a>. The <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> met the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Celtics</a> for the third time in the <a href="1987%20NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a>, and in Game 4 Johnson hit a last-second hook shot over Celtics <a href="frontcourt">big men</a> Parish and <a href="Kevin%20McHale%20%28basketball%29">Kevin McHale</a> to win the game 107–106. The game-winning shot, which Johnson dubbed his "junior, junior, junior <a href="hook%20shot">sky-hook</a>", helped Los Angeles defeat Boston in six games. Johnson was awarded his third Finals MVP title after averaging 26.2 points on .541 shooting, 13.0 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 2.33 steals per game.

Before the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20NBA%20season">1987–88 NBA season</a>, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Celtics</a> did so in the <a href="1969%20NBA%20Finals">1969 NBA Finals</a>. Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury. In the <a href="1988%20NBA%20Playoffs">1988 playoffs</a>, the Lakers swept the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20San%20Antonio%20Spurs%20season">San Antonio Spurs</a> in 3 games, then survived two 4–3 series against the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Utah%20Jazz%20season">Utah Jazz</a> and the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Dallas%20Mavericks%20season">Dallas Mavericks</a> to reach <a href="1988%20NBA%20Finals">the Finals</a> and face Thomas and the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Detroit Pistons</a>, who with players such as <a href="Bill%20Laimbeer">Bill Laimbeer</a>, <a href="John%20Salley">John Salley</a>, <a href="Vinnie%20Johnson">Vinnie Johnson</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a> were known as the "Bad Boys" for their physical style of play. Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the <a href="opening%20tip">opening tip</a> of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP <a href="James%20Worthy">James Worthy</a> had his first career <a href="triple-double">triple-double</a> of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108–105 win. Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13.0 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game. It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career.

In the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NBA%20season">1988–89 NBA season</a>, Johnson's 22.5 points, 12.8 assists, and 7.9 rebounds per game earned him his second MVP award, and the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> reached the <a href="1989%20NBA%20Finals">1989 NBA Finals</a>, in which they again faced the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Pistons</a>. However, after Johnson went down with a hamstring injury in Game 2, the Lakers were no match for the Pistons, who swept them 4–0.

Playing without Abdul-Jabbar for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award after a strong <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NBA%20season">1989–90 NBA season</a> in which he averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 assists, and 6.6 rebounds per game. However, the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Lakers</a> bowed out to the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Phoenix%20Suns%20season">Phoenix Suns</a> in the <a href="1990%20NBA%20Playoffs">Western Conference semifinals</a>, which was the Lakers' earliest playoffs elimination in nine years. <a href="Mike%20Dunleavy%2C%20Sr.">Mike Dunleavy</a> became the Lakers' head coach in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">1990–91</a>, when Johnson had grown to be the league's third-oldest point guard. He had become more powerful and stronger than in his earlier years, but was also slower and less nimble. Under Dunleavy, the offense used more half-court sets, and the team had a renewed emphasis on defense. Johnson performed well during the season, with averages of 19.4 points, 12.5 assists, and 7.0 rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the <a href="1991%20NBA%20Finals">1991 NBA Finals</a>. There they faced the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">Chicago Bulls</a>, led by <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his era. Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson and Jordan, Bulls forward <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a> defended effectively against Johnson. Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, finals MVP Jordan led his team to a 4–1 win. In the last championship series of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6 points on .431 shooting, 12.4 assists, and 8.0 rebounds per game.

After a <a href="Physical%20examination">physical</a> before the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NBA%20season">1991–92 NBA season</a>, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately. He stated that his wife Cookie and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to "battle this deadly disease".

Johnson initially said that he did not know how he contracted the disease, but later acknowledged that it was through having numerous sexual partners during his playing career. He admitted to having "harems of women" and talked openly about his sexual activities because "he was convinced that heterosexuals needed to know that they, too, were at risk". At the time, only a small percentage of HIV-positive American men had contracted it from heterosexual sex, and it was initially rumored that Johnson was <a href="gay">gay</a> or <a href="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>, although he denied both. Johnson later accused <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a> of spreading the rumors, a claim Thomas denied.

Johnson's HIV announcement became a major news story in the United States, and in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh-most memorable moment of the previous 25 years. Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> said, "For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports."

Despite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as a starter for the <a href="1992%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1992 NBA All-Star Game</a> at <a href="Orlando%20Arena">Orlando Arena</a>, although his former teammates <a href="Byron%20Scott%20%28basketball%29">Byron Scott</a> and <a href="A.%20C.%20Green">A. C. Green</a> said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a>, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153–113 win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute <a href="three-pointer">three-pointer</a>, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.

Johnson was chosen to compete in the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">US basketball team</a>, dubbed the "<a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">Dream Team</a>" because of the NBA stars on the roster. The Dream Team, which along with Johnson included fellow <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> such as <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a>, and <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a>, was considered unbeatable. The Dream Team dominated the competition, winning the gold medal with an 8–0 record, beating their opponents by an average of 43.8 points per game. Johnson averaged 8.0 points per game during the Olympics, and his 5.5 assists per game was second on the team. Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a>s from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.

Before the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NBA%20season">1992–93 NBA season</a>, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. In an August 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, "If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired." Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he "didn't want to hurt the game."

During his retirement, Johnson has written a book on <a href="safe%20sex">safe sex</a>, run several businesses, worked for <a href="NBC">NBC</a> as a <a href="Color%20commentator">commentator</a>, and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team of former college and NBA players. In 1985, Johnson created "A Midsummer Night's Magic", a yearly charity event which included a celebrity basketball game and a <a href="black%20tie%20event">black tie</a> dinner. The proceeds went to the <a href="United%20Negro%20College%20Fund">United Negro College Fund</a>, and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005. "A Midsummer Night's Magic" eventually came under the umbrella of the <a href="Magic%20Johnson%20Foundation">Magic Johnson Foundation</a>, which he founded in 1991. The 1992 event, which was the first one held after Johnson's appearance in the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Olympics</a>, raised over $1.3 million for UNCF. Magic Johnson joined <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> and celebrity coach <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a> to lead the blue team to a 147–132 victory over the white team, which was coached by <a href="Arsenio%20Hall">Arsenio Hall</a>.

Johnson returned to the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NBA%20season">1993–94 NBA season</a>, replacing <a href="Randy%20Pfund">Randy Pfund</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Bertka">Bill Bertka</a>, who served as an interim coach for two games. Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner <a href="Jerry%20Buss">Jerry Buss</a>, admitted "I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back of my mind." He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, "I'm retired. Let's leave it at that." Amid speculation from general manager <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a> that he may only coach until the end of the season, Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the <a href="Milwaukee%20Bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a>. He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: <a href="Vlade%20Divac">Vlade Divac</a>, <a href="Elden%20Campbell">Elden Campbell</a>, <a href="Tony%20Smith%20%28basketball%29">Tony Smith</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Rambis">Kurt Rambis</a>, <a href="James%20Worthy">James Worthy</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Cooper">Michael Cooper</a>, who was brought in as an assistant coach. Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NBA%20season">1994–95 NBA season</a>, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation. The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11. Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.

At the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback as a player when he re-joined the Lakers during the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20NBA%20season">1995–96 NBA season</a>. During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his <a href="bench%20press">bench press</a> from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Golden%20State%20Warriors%20season">Golden State Warriors</a>. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Atlanta%20Hawks%20season">Atlanta Hawks</a>. Playing <a href="Power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">power forward</a>, he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a> in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22–10 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback "a success." While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. <a href="Cedric%20Ceballos">Cedric Ceballos</a>, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnson's arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain. <a href="Nick%20Van%20Exel">Nick Van Exel</a> received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee <a href="Ron%20Garretson">Ron Garretson</a> during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were "inexcusable." Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53–29 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Houston%20Rockets%20season">Houston Rockets</a>, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach <a href="Del%20Harris">Del Harris</a>' offense. Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets won three games to one.

After the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of <a href="1996%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>, Johnson initially expressed a desire to return to the team for the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NBA%20season">1996–97 NBA season</a>, but he also talked about joining another team as a free agent, hoping to see more playing time at point guard instead of power forward. A few days later Johnson changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, "I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992."

Determined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players. In 1994, Johnson joined with former pros <a href="Mark%20Aguirre">Mark Aguirre</a>, <a href="Reggie%20Theus">Reggie Theus</a>, <a href="John%20Long%20%28basketball%29">John Long</a>, <a href="Earl%20Cureton">Earl Cureton</a>, <a href="Jim%20Farmer">Jim Farmer</a>, and <a href="Lester%20Conner">Lester Conner</a>, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the <a href="Continental%20Basketball%20Association">CBA</a>. In the final game of the CBA series, Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126–121 victory over the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Cavalry">Oklahoma City Cavalry</a>. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55–0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November 2001. At the age of 42, Johnson played with the All-Stars against his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>, <a href="Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan State</a>. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnson's first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a <a href="triple-double">triple-double</a> and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnson's half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002, Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State. Playing with the <a href="Canberra%20Cannons">Canberra Cannons</a> of Australia's <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28Australasia%29">National Basketball League</a> instead of his usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104–85, as he scored 12 points, with 10 assists and 10 rebounds.

In 1999, Johnson joined the Swedish squad <a href="Bor%C3%A5s%20Basket">M7 Borås</a> (now known as 'Borås Basket'), and was undefeated in five games with the team. Johnson also became a co-owner of the club; however, the project failed after one season and the club was forced into reconstruction. He later joined the Danish team The Great Danes.

On February 21, 2017, Johnson replaced <a href="Jim%20Buss">Jim Buss</a> as the president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers.

Johnson first fathered a son in 1981, when Andre Johnson was born to Melissa Mitchell. Although Andre was raised by his mother, he visited Johnson each summer, and later worked for <a href="Magic%20Johnson%20Enterprises">Magic Johnson Enterprises</a> as a marketing director. In 1991, Johnson married Earlitha "Cookie" Kelly in a small wedding in Lansing which included guests Thomas, Aguirre, and <a href="Herb%20Williams">Herb Williams</a>. Johnson and Cookie have one son, <a href="EJ%20Johnson">Earvin III</a> (EJ), who is <a href="homosexuality">openly gay</a> and a star on the reality show "<a href="Rich%20Kids%20of%20Beverly%20Hills">Rich Kids of Beverly Hills</a>". The couple adopted a daughter, Elisa, in 1995. Johnson resides in <a href="Dana%20Point%2C%20California">Dana Point, California</a>.

Johnson is a Christian and has said his faith is "the most important thing" in his life.

In 2010, Magic Johnson and current and former NBA players such as <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a>, <a href="Dwyane%20Wade">Dwyane Wade</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Russell">Bill Russell</a>, as well as <a href="Maya%20Moore">Maya Moore</a> from the <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20Association">WNBA</a>, played a basketball game with President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> as an exhibition for a group of military troops who had been injured in action. The game was played at a gym inside <a href="Fort%20McNair">Fort McNair</a>, and reporters covering the president were not allowed to enter. The basketball game was part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.

In 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> called "<a href="The%20Magic%20Hour%20%28talk%20show%29">The Magic Hour</a>", but the show was canceled after two months because of low <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings</a>. Shortly after the cancellation of his talk show, Magic Johnson started a record label. The label, initially called Magic 32 Records, was renamed Magic Johnson Music when Johnson signed a <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> with <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA</a> in 2000. Magic Johnson Music signed R&B artist <a href="Avant%20%28singer%29">Avant</a> as its first act. Johnson also <a href="Concert%20promoter">co-promoted</a> <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s <a href="The%20Velvet%20Rope%20Tour">Velvet Rope Tour</a> through his company Magicworks. He has also worked as a <a href="motivational%20speaker">motivational speaker</a>, and was an NBA commentator for <a href="Turner%20Network%20Television">Turner Network Television</a> for seven years, before becoming a studio analyst for ESPN's "<a href="NBA%20Countdown">NBA Countdown</a>" in 2008.

Johnson runs Magic Johnson Enterprises, a conglomerate company that has a net worth of $700 million; its subsidiaries include Magic Johnson Productions, a promotional company; <a href="Magic%20Johnson%20Theaters">Magic Johnson Theaters</a>, a nationwide chain of movie theaters; and Magic Johnson Entertainment, a film studio. In addition to these business ventures, Johnson has also created the "Magic Card", a <a href="Stored-value%20card">pre-paid</a> <a href="MasterCard">MasterCard</a> aimed at helping low-income people save money and participate in <a href="electronic%20commerce">electronic commerce</a>. In 2006, Johnson created a contract food service with <a href="Sodexo">Sodexo</a> USA called Sodexo-Magic. In 2004, Johnson and his partner Ken Lombard, sold Magic Johnson Theaters to <a href="Loews%20Cineplex%20Entertainment">Loews Cineplex Entertainment</a> in 2004. The first Magic Johnson Theater located in the <a href="Baldwin%20Hills%20Crenshaw%20Plaza">Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza</a>, closed in 2010 and re-opened in 2011 as <a href="Rave%20Cinemas">Rave Cinema</a> 15.

Johnson began thinking of life after basketball while still playing with the Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he had a meeting with <a href="Michael%20Ovitz">Michael Ovitz</a>, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a <a href="Luxury%20goods">high-end</a> sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating <a href="redevelopment">redevelopment</a> opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his <a href="partnership">partnership</a> with Starbucks. He went to <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> CEO <a href="Howard%20Schultz">Howard Schultz</a> with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Washington, D.C., <a href="Harlem%2C%20New%20York">Harlem</a>, and the <a href="Crenshaw%20District">Crenshaw District</a> of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. He has also made investments in urban real estate through the Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2005–2007, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the <a href="Williamsburgh%20Savings%20Bank%20Tower">Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower</a>, then the tallest building in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.

In 1994, Johnson became a minority owner of the Lakers, having reportedly paid more than $10 million for part ownership. He also held the title of team vice president. Johnson sold his ownership stake in the Lakers in October 2010 to <a href="Patrick%20Soon-Shiong">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, a Los Angeles surgeon and professor at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, but continued as an unpaid vice president for the team. In February 2017, Johnson returned to the Lakers as an advisor to Jeanie Buss.

In the wake of the <a href="Donald%20Sterling">Donald Sterling</a> controversy, limited media reports indicated that Johnson had expressed an interest in purchasing the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a> franchise.

In 2015, Johnson completed his planned acquisition for a "majority, controlling interest" in EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, which manages $14.5 billion in annuities, life insurance and other financial products.

He is an investor for aXiomatic eSports, the ownership company of <a href="Team%20Liquid">Team Liquid</a>.

In January 2012, Johnson joined with <a href="Guggenheim%20Partners">Guggenheim Partners</a> and <a href="Stan%20Kasten">Stan Kasten</a> in a bid for ownership of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> baseball team. In March 2012, Johnson's ownership group was announced as the winner of the proceedings to buy the Dodgers. The Johnson-led group, which also includes movie executive <a href="Peter%20Guber">Peter Guber</a>, paid $2 billion for the Dodgers, the largest amount paid for a professional sports team. While Johnson is considered the leader of the ownership group, the <a href="controlling%20interest">controlling owner</a> is Mark Walter, chief executive officer for Guggenheim Partners. Peter Guber, who is the co-owner of the <a href="Golden%20State%20Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, owns a small stake in the Dodgers along with Johnson.

Johnson and Guber were also partners in the <a href="Dayton%20Dragons">Dayton Dragons</a>, a <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball%23Class%20A">Class-A minor league baseball</a> team in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, that sold out more than 1,000 consecutive games, a record for professional sports. Johnson and Guber sold their stake in the Dragons in 2014.

Together with Guggenheim, Johnson was also involved in the February 2014 purchase of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Sparks">Los Angeles Sparks</a> team in the <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20Association">WNBA</a>. As such, in 2014, Johnson was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25. He won the WNBA championship as the owner in <a href="2016%20WNBA%20Finals">2016</a>.

Johnson announced his co-ownership of a <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> expansion franchise based in Los Angeles on October 30, 2014. The temporary name was <a href="Los%20Angeles%20FC">Los Angeles Football Club</a>, which later became permanent in 2015.

Johnson is a supporter of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. In 2006, he publicly endorsed <a href="Phil%20Angelides">Phil Angelides</a> for <a href="governor%20of%20California">governor of California</a>, in 2007 he supported <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in her <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">presidential campaign</a>, and in 2010 he endorsed <a href="Barbara%20Boxer">Barbara Boxer</a> in her <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20California%2C%202010">race for re-election</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">US Senate</a>. In 2012, he endorsed <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> for president. He endorsed and appeared in campaign ads for unsuccessful Los Angeles mayoral candidate <a href="Wendy%20Greuel">Wendy Greuel</a> in 2013. In 2015, he once again endorsed Hillary Clinton in her <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">second presidential campaign</a>. He hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.

After announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the <a href="Magic%20Johnson%20Foundation">Magic Johnson Foundation</a> to help combat HIV, although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals. In 1992, he joined the <a href="National%20Commission%20on%20AIDS">National Commission on AIDS</a>, a committee appointed by members of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and the <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">Bush Administration</a>. Johnson left after eight months, saying that the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> had "utterly ignored" the work of the panel, and had opposed the commission's recommendations, which included <a href="universal%20healthcare">universal healthcare</a> and the expansion of <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> to cover all low-income people with AIDS. He was also the main speaker for the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) <a href="World%20AIDS%20Day">World AIDS Day</a> Conference in 1999, and has served as a <a href="United%20Nations%20Messengers%20of%20Peace">United Nations Messenger of Peace</a>.

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals, but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to "help educate all people about what [HIV] is about" and teach others not to "discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS". Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.

To prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a <a href="Antiretroviral%20drug">daily combination of drugs</a>. He has advertised <a href="GlaxoSmithKline">GlaxoSmithKline</a>'s drugs, and partnered with <a href="Abbott%20Laboratories">Abbott Laboratories</a> to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.

In 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history. Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24), holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21), and has the most playoff assists (2,346). He is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving it six times. He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127).

Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "<a href="Showtime%20%28basketball%29">Showtime</a>", described as a mix of "no-look passes off the <a href="fast%20break">fastbreak</a>, pin-point <a href="Alley-oop%20%28basketball%29">alley-oops</a> from <a href="half%20court">halfcourt</a>, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through <a href="double%20team">triple teams</a>." Fellow Lakers guard <a href="Michael%20Cooper">Michael Cooper</a> said, "There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the <a href="1982%20NBA%20Finals">1982 NBA Finals</a>, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.

Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size reserved normally for <a href="frontcourt">frontcourt</a> players. He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a <a href="swingman">swingman</a>, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous <a href="triple-double">triple-double</a> threats of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only to <a href="Oscar%20Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a>'s 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.

For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the <a href="50%20Greatest%20Players%20in%20NBA%20History">50 Greatest Players of All Time</a> by the NBA in 1996, and was inducted into the <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</a> in 2002. ESPN's "SportsCentury" ranked Johnson #17 in their "50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century" In 2006, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time, stating, "It could be argued that he's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan." Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA.

Johnson and <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a> were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily <a href="box%20score">box score</a> was the first thing he checked in the morning.

Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana <a href="Blue-collar%20worker">blue collar</a> grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>.

Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 <a href="Converse%20%28company%29">Converse</a> shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a "friend forever"; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.

In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist <a href="Jackie%20MacMullan">Jackie MacMullan</a> on a non-fiction book titled "When the Game Was Ours". The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship with one another. The following year, <a href="HBO">HBO</a> developed a documentary about their rivalry titled "", which was directed by <a href="Ezra%20Edelman">Ezra Edelman</a>.

Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner <a href="Jerry%20Buss">Jerry Buss</a>, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure. Calling Buss his "second father" and "one of [his] best friends", Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, "Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic." Buss acquired the team from <a href="Jack%20Kent%20Cooke">Jack Kent Cooke</a> in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the <a href="1979%20NBA%20draft">1979 NBA draft</a>. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994. Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Buss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.
Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NBA%20season">1992–93 NBA season</a> voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.

Pericles

Pericles (; "Periklēs", in <a href="Attic%20Greek">Classical Attic</a>; c. 495 – 429 BC) was a prominent and influential <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="Politician">statesman</a>, orator and general of <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a> during its golden age – specifically the time between the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Persian</a> and <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian</a> wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential <a href="Alcmaeonidae">Alcmaeonid</a> family. Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, a contemporary historian, acclaimed him as "the first citizen of Athens". Pericles turned the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> into an Athenian empire, and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the "<a href="Age%20of%20Pericles">Age of Pericles</a>", though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the <a href="Persian%20Wars">Persian Wars</a>, or as late as the next century.

Pericles promoted the arts and literature; it is principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a> (including the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>). This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people. Pericles also fostered <a href="Athenian%20democracy">Athenian democracy</a> to such an extent that critics call him a <a href="Populism">populist</a>. He, along with several members of his family, succumbed to the <a href="Plague%20of%20Athens">Plague of Athens</a> in 429 BC, which weakened the city-state during a protracted conflict with <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

Pericles was born c. 495 BC, in Athens, Greece. He was the son of the politician <a href="Xanthippus">Xanthippus</a>, who, though <a href="Ostracism">ostracized</a> in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Mycale">Mycale</a> just five years later. Pericles' mother, Agariste, a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the <a href="Alcmaeonidae">Alcmaeonidae</a>, and her familial connections played a crucial role in helping start Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>, <a href="Cleisthenes%20of%20Sicyon">Cleisthenes</a>, and the niece of the Athenian reformer <a href="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a>.

According to <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Agariste dreamed, a few nights before Pericles' birth, that she had borne a lion. Legends say that Philip II of Macedon had a similar dream before the birth of his son, Alexander the Great. One interpretation of the dream treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusually large size of Pericles' skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians (who called him "Squill-head", after the <a href="Drimia%20maritima">squill</a> or sea-onion). Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as <a href="strategos">strategos</a> (general).

Pericles belonged to the <a href="tribe">tribe</a> of Acamantis (). His early years were quiet; the introverted young Pericles avoided public appearances, instead preferring to devote his time to his studies.

His family's nobility and wealth allowed him to fully pursue his inclination toward education. He learned music from the masters of the time (<a href="Damon%20%28ancient%20Greek%20musicologist%29">Damon</a> or Pythocleides could have been his teacher) and he is considered to have been the first politician to attribute importance to <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>. He enjoyed the company of the <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>s <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a>, <a href="Zeno%20of%20Elea">Zeno of Elea</a>, and <a href="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>. Anaxagoras, in particular, became a close friend and influenced him greatly.

Pericles' manner of thought and <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>al charisma may have been in part products of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble, and <a href="philosophical%20scepticism">skepticism</a> about divine phenomena. His proverbial calmness and self-control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras' influence.

In the spring of 472 BC, Pericles presented "<a href="The%20Persians">The Persians</a>" of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> at the <a href="Greater%20Dionysia">Greater Dionysia</a> as a <a href="Liturgy%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">liturgy</a>, demonstrating that he was one of the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>' famous victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Salamis</a>, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.

Plutarch says that Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. If this was so, Pericles must have taken up a position of leadership by the early 460s BC in his early or mid-thirties. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself as a model for his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.

In 463 BC, Pericles was the leading prosecutor of Cimon, the leader of the conservative faction who was accused of neglecting Athens' vital interests in <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>. Although Cimon was acquitted, this confrontation proved that Pericles' major political opponent was vulnerable.

Around 461 BC, the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the <a href="Areopagus">Areopagus</a>, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state. The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, <a href="Ephialtes%20of%20Athens">Ephialtes</a>, proposed a reduction of the Areopagus' powers. The <a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">Ecclesia</a> (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of "radical democracy".

The democratic party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing to follow a populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Pericles' stance can be explained by the fact that his principal political opponent, <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>, was both rich and generous, and was able to gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.

In 461 BC, Pericles achieved the political elimination of this opponent using <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a>. The accusation was that Cimon betrayed his city by aiding <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles continued to promote a populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering the cost of their admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the <a href="archon">archon</a>ship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the <a href="Heliaia">Heliaia</a> (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454 BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.

Such measures impelled Pericles' critics to hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. <a href="Constantine%20Paparregopoulus">Constantine Paparrigopoulos</a>, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions. Hence, he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred.

According to Samons, Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the "<a href="Deme">demos</a>", in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance. (The fleet, backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles, was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes.)

Cimon, on the other hand, apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished as a result of Pericles' populist policies.

According to another historian, Justin Daniel King, radical democracy benefited people individually, but harmed the state. On the other hand, <a href="Donald%20Kagan">Donald Kagan</a> asserts that the democratic measures Pericles put into effect provided the basis for an unassailable political strength. After all, Cimon finally accepted the new democracy and did not oppose the citizenship law, after he returned from exile in 451 BC.

Ephialtes' murder in 461 BC paved the way for Pericles to consolidate his authority. Without opposition after the expulsion of Cimon, the unchallengeable leader of the democratic party became the unchallengeable ruler of Athens. He remained in power until his death in 429 BC.

Pericles made his first military excursions during the First Peloponnesian War, which was caused in part by Athens' alliance with <a href="Megara">Megara</a> and <a href="Argos">Argos</a> and the subsequent reaction of Sparta. In 454 BC he attacked <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a> and <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>. He then unsuccessfully tried to conquer Oeniadea on the <a href="Corinthian%20gulf">Corinthian gulf</a>, before returning to Athens. In 451 BC, Cimon returned from exile and negotiated a five years' truce with Sparta after a proposal of Pericles, an event which indicates a shift in Pericles' political strategy. Pericles may have realized the importance of Cimon's contribution during the ongoing conflicts against the Peloponnesians and the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a>. Anthony J. Podlecki argues, however, that Pericles' alleged change of position was invented by ancient writers to support "a tendentious view of Pericles' shiftiness".

Plutarch states that Cimon struck a power-sharing deal with his opponents, according to which Pericles would carry through the interior affairs and Cimon would be the leader of the Athenian army, campaigning abroad. If it was actually made, this bargain would constitute a concession on Pericles' part that he was not a great strategist. Kagan's view is that Cimon adapted himself to the new conditions and promoted a political marriage between Periclean liberals and Cimonian conservatives.

In the mid-450s the Athenians launched an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, which led to a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Cimon defeated the Persians in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis%20%28in%20Cyprus%29">Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus</a>, but died of disease in 449 BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as <a href="Karl%20Julius%20Beloch">Karl Julius Beloch</a>, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.

Complicating the account of this period is the issue of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Callias">Peace of Callias</a>, which allegedly ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated at the conclusion of the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448 BC.

John Fine, on the other hand, suggests that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449 BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>. Kagan believes that Pericles used <a href="Callias">Callias</a>, a brother-in-law of Cimon, as a symbol of unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.

In the spring of 449 BC, Pericles proposed the Congress Decree, which led to a meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' intentions remain unclear. Some historians think that he wanted to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others think he wanted to assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> and for the collection of "phoros" (taxes).

During the <a href="Second%20Sacred%20War">Second Sacred War</a> Pericles led the Athenian army against <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and reinstated <a href="Phocis%20%28ancient%20region%29">Phocis</a> in its sovereign rights on the <a href="oracle">oracle</a>. In 447 BC Pericles engaged in his most admired excursion, the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, in order to establish Athenian colonists in the region. At this time, however, Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its subjects. In 447 BC the oligarchs of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> conspired against the democratic faction. The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender, but after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronea%20%28447%20BC%29">Battle of Coronea</a>, Pericles was forced to concede the loss of Boeotia in order to recover the prisoners taken in that battle. With Boeotia in hostile hands, Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs.

In 446 BC, a more dangerous uprising erupted. <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> and <a href="Megara">Megara</a> revolted. Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops, but was forced to return when the Spartan army invaded <a href="Attica">Attica</a>. Through bribery and negotiations, Pericles defused the imminent threat, and the Spartans returned home. When Pericles was later audited for the handling of public money, an expenditure of 10 <a href="Greek%20talent">talents</a> was not sufficiently justified, since the official documents just referred that the money was spent for a "very serious purpose". Nonetheless, the "serious purpose" (namely the bribery) was so obvious to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery.

After the Spartan threat had been removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea to crush the revolt there. He then punished the landowners of <a href="Chalcis">Chalcis</a>, who lost their properties. The residents of <a href="Oreus">Histiaea</a>, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian <a href="trireme">trireme</a>, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20Peace">Thirty Years' Peace</a> (winter of 446–445 BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460 BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt to win over the other state's allies.

In 444 BC, the conservative and the democratic factions confronted each other in a fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of the conservatives, <a href="Thucydides%20%28politician%29">Thucydides</a> (not to be confused with the historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442 BC, the Athenian public voted to <a href="Ostracism">ostracize</a> Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.

Pericles wanted to stabilize Athens' dominance over its alliance and to enforce its pre-eminence in Greece. The process by which the Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.

The final steps in the shift to empire may have been triggered by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean and led to the revolt of several allies, such as <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> and <a href="Erythrae">Erythrae</a>. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from <a href="Delos">Delos</a> to Athens in 454–453 BC.

By 450–449 BC the revolts in Miletus and Erythrae were quelled and Athens restored its rule over its allies. Around 447 BC Clearchus proposed the Coinage Decree, which imposed Athenian silver coinage, weights and measures on all of the allies. According to one of the decree's most stringent provisions, surplus from a minting operation was to go into a special fund, and anyone proposing to use it otherwise was subject to the death penalty.

It was from the alliance's treasury that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious building plan, centered on the "Periclean Acropolis", which included the <a href="Propylaea">Propylaea</a>, the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena, sculpted by Pericles' friend, <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a>. In 449 BC Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9,000 talents to finance the major rebuilding program of Athenian temples. Angelos Vlachos, a Greek <a href="Academician">Academician</a>, points out the utilization of the alliance's treasury, initiated and executed by Pericles, as one of the largest embezzlements in human history; this misappropriation financed, however, some of the most marvellous artistic creations of the ancient world.

The Samian War was one of the last significant military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the "de facto" ruler of the state. In 440 BC <a href="Samos">Samos</a> went to war against <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> over control of <a href="Priene">Priene</a>, an ancient city of <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> on the foot-hills of <a href="Mycale">Mycale</a>. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.

When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration in Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos, "alleging against its people that, although they were ordered to break off their war against the Milesians, they were not complying".

In a naval battle the Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals defeated the forces of Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration. When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors. Pericles then quelled a revolt in <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and, when he returned to Athens, gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers who died in the expedition.

Between 438–436 BC Pericles led Athens' fleet in <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a> and established friendly relations with the Greek cities of the region. Pericles focused also on internal projects, such as the fortification of Athens (the building of the "middle wall" about 440 BC), and on the creation of new <a href="Cleruchy">cleruchies</a>, such as <a href="Andros">Andros</a>, <a href="Naxos%20Island">Naxos</a> and <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> (444 BC) as well as <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> (437–436 BC).

Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack, as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, <a href="Aspasia">Aspasia</a>, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.

Phidias, who had been in charge of all building projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of <a href="Athena">Athena</a> and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a> on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.

Aspasia, who was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were probably nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the <a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a> for his religious beliefs.

Beyond these initial prosecutions, the ecclesia attacked Pericles himself by asking him to justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did not let the Athenians yield to the <a href="Lacedaemonians">Lacedaemonians</a>. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, at the start of the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.

The causes of the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics "with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife". Thucydides hints at the same thing, believing the reason for the war was Sparta's fear of Athenian power and growth. However, as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has been criticized for bias against <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta, which could not conceal its envy of Athens' pre-eminence, was inevitable if unfortunate. Therefore, he did not hesitate to send troops to <a href="Corcyra">Corcyra</a> to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, which was fighting against <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>. In 433 BC the enemy fleets confronted each other at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sybota">Battle of Sybota</a> and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Potidaea">Battle of Potidaea</a>; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth's lasting hatred of Athens. During the same period, Pericles proposed the <a href="Megarian%20decree">Megarian Decree</a>, which resembled a modern trade embargo. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which was allied with Megara. According to <a href="George%20Cawkwell">George Cawkwell</a>, a <a href="praelector">praelector</a> in <a href="ancient%20history">ancient history</a>, with this decree Pericles breached the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20Peace">Thirty Years' Peace</a> "but, perhaps, not without the semblance of an excuse". The Athenians' justification was that the Megarians had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> and had given refuge to runaway slaves, a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious.

After consultations with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later. At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles' instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents' demands, since they were militarily stronger. Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions, believing that "if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands". Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a "quid pro quo". In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory (<a href="xenelasia">xenelasia</a>) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta's hegemony was also ruthless. The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and with neither side willing to back down, the two cities prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and <a href="international%20politics">international politics</a>, "rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war". Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles' stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed itself weak.

In 431 BC, while peace already was precarious, <a href="Archidamus%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Archidamus II</a>, Sparta's king, sent a new delegation to Athens, demanding that the Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.

No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas. For most, the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle. Therefore, although they agreed to leave, many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles' decision. Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that, if the enemy did not plunder his farms, he would offer his property to the city. This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, might pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.

In any case, seeing the pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even when in the face of mounting pressure, Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field. As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the "prytanies", Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished. While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city. When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces. According to the most stringent provision of the decree, even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death. During the autumn of 431 BC, Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later (winter of 431–430 BC) he delivered his monumental and emotional <a href="Pericles%27%20Funeral%20Oration">Funeral Oration</a>, honoring the Athenians who died for their city.

In 430 BC, the army of Sparta looted Attica for a second time, but Pericles was not daunted and refused to revise his initial strategy. Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle, he again led a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnese, this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him. According to Plutarch, just before the sailing of the ships an <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a> of the <a href="sun">sun</a> frightened the crews, but Pericles used the astronomical knowledge he had acquired from Anaxagoras to calm them. In the summer of the same year <a href="Plague%20of%20Athens">an epidemic broke out</a> and devastated the Athenians. The exact identity of the disease is uncertain, typhus or typhoid fever are suspected, but this has been the source of much debate. In any case, the city's plight, caused by the epidemic, triggered a new wave of public uproar, and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech, a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides. This is considered to be a monumental oration, revealing Pericles' virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots' ingratitude. Temporarily, he managed to tame the people's resentment and to ride out the storm, but his internal enemies' final bid to undermine him came off; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents. Ancient sources mention <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>, a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war, as the public prosecutor in Pericles' trial.
Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians not only forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was reinstated in command of the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, <a href="Paralus%20and%20Xanthippus">Paralus and Xanthippus</a>, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.

Just before his death, Pericles' friends were concentrated around his bed, enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies. Pericles, though moribund, heard them and interrupted them, pointing out that they forgot to mention his fairest and greatest title to their admiration; "for", said he, "no living Athenian ever put on mourning because of me". Pericles lived during the first two and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and, according to Thucydides, his death was a disaster for Athens, since his successors were inferior to him; they preferred to incite all the bad habits of the rabble and followed an unstable policy, endeavoring to be popular rather than useful. With these bitter comments, Thucydides not only laments the loss of a man he admired, but he also heralds the flickering of Athens' unique glory and grandeur.

Pausanias (c. 150 AD) records (I.29) seeing the tomb of Pericles along a road near the Academy.

Pericles, following Athenian custom, was first married to one of his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, <a href="Paralus%20and%20Xanthippus">Paralus and Xanthippus</a>, but around 445 BC, Pericles divorced his wife. He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of <a href="Callias%20III">Callias</a> from this first marriage.

After Pericles divorced his wife, he had a long-term relationship with <a href="Aspasia">Aspasia of Miletus</a>, with whom he had a son, <a href="Pericles%20the%20Younger">Pericles the Younger</a>. This relationship aroused many reactions and even Pericles' own son, Xanthippus, who had political ambitions, did not hesitate to slander his father. Nonetheless, objections did not undermine Pericles' morale, although he burst into tears to protect Aspasia when she was accused of corrupting Athenian society. His sister and both his legitimate sons, Xanthippus and Paralus, died during an epidemic of plague. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in consideration that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.

Pericles marked a whole era and inspired conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The fact that he was at the same time a vigorous statesman, general and orator only tends to make an objective assessment of his actions more difficult.

Some contemporary scholars call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk, while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming the leadership of Athens, "he was no longer the same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes". It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won. In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians, since "he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making".

Thucydides (the historian), an admirer of Pericles, maintains that Athens was "in name a democracy but, in fact, governed by its first citizen". Through this comment, the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles' charisma to lead, convince and, sometimes, to manipulate. Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles, he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles' integrity. On the other hand, in one of his dialogues, <a href="Plato">Plato</a> rejects the glorification of Pericles and declares: "as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees".
Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles' leadership: "many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing".

Thucydides argues that Pericles "was not carried away by the people, but he was the one guiding the people". His judgement is not unquestioned; some 20th-century critics, such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or the people themselves. According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader. During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles' dependence on popular support to govern was obvious.

For more than 20 years Pericles led many expeditions, mainly naval ones. Being always cautious, he never undertook of his own accord a battle involving much uncertainty and peril and he did not accede to the "vain impulses of the citizens". He based his military policy on <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>' principle that Athens' predominance depends on its superior naval power and believed that the Peloponnesians were near-invincible on land. Pericles also tried to minimize the advantages of Sparta by rebuilding the walls of Athens, which, it has been suggested, radically altered the use of force in Greek international relations.

During the Peloponnesian War, Pericles initiated a defensive "<a href="grand%20strategy">grand strategy</a>" whose aim was the exhaustion of the enemy and the preservation of the "status quo". According to Platias and Koliopoulos, Athens as the strongest party did not have to beat Sparta in military terms and "chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory". The two basic principles of the "Periclean Grand Strategy" were the rejection of appeasement (in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree) and the avoidance of overextension. According to Kagan, Pericles' vehement insistence that there should be no diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign, which he had allegedly supported. His strategy is said to have been "inherently unpopular", but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it. It is for that reason that <a href="Hans%20Delbr%C3%BCck">Hans Delbrück</a> called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history. Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death, Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve, not expand, the empire, and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition. For his part, Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer.

Critics of Pericles' strategy, however, have been just as numerous as its supporters. A common criticism is that Pericles was always a better politician and orator than strategist. <a href="Donald%20Kagan">Donald Kagan</a> called the Periclean strategy "a form of wishful thinking that failed", Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that "as strategist he was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens' great defeat", and <a href="Victor%20Davis%20Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> believes that Pericles had not worked out a clear strategy for an effective offensive action that could possibly force Thebes or Sparta to stop the war. Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts: first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war; second, that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility; third, that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities; and fourth, that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death. Kagan estimates Pericles' expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2,000 <a href="Talent%20%28weight%29">talents</a> annually, and based on this figure concludes that he would only have enough money to keep the war going for three years. He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war. Others, such as Donald W. Knight, conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed.

On the other hand, Platias and Koliopoulos reject these criticisms and state that "the Athenians lost the war only when they dramatically reversed the Periclean grand strategy that explicitly disdained further conquests". Hanson stresses that the Periclean strategy was not innovative, but could lead to a stagnancy in favor of Athens. It is a popular conclusion that those succeeding him lacked his abilities and character.

Modern commentators of <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, with other modern historians and writers, take varying stances on the issue of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.

Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.

Ioannis Kakridis and Arnold Gomme were two scholars who debated the originality of Pericles' oratory and last speech. Kakridis believes that Thucydides altered Pericles words. Some of his strongest arguments included in the Introduction of the speech, (Thuc.11.35). Kakridis proposes that it is impossible to imagine Pericles deviating away from the expected funeral orator addressing the mourning audience of 430 after the Peloponnesian war. The two groups addressed were the ones who were prepared to believe him when he praised the dead, and the ones who did not. Gomme rejects Kakridis position, defending the fact that "Nobody of men has ever been so conscious of envy and its workings as the Greeks, and that the Greeks and Thucydides in particular had a passion for covering all ground in their generalizations, not always relevantly.".
Kagan states that Pericles adopted "an elevated mode of speech, free from the vulgar and knavish tricks of mob-orators" and, according to <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, he "excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory". According to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner. The biographer points out, however, that the poet <a href="Ion%20of%20Chios">Ion</a> reported that Pericles' speaking style was "a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others".

<a href="Gorgias">Gorgias</a>, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory. In <a href="Menexenus%20%28dialogue%29">Menexenus</a>, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by <a href="Antiphon%20%28person%29">Antiphon</a>. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.

<a href="Richard%20Claverhouse%20Jebb">Sir Richard C. Jebb</a> concludes that "unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians".

Ancient Greek writers call Pericles "Olympian" and extol his talents; referring to him "thundering and lightning and exciting Greece" and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating. According to <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a>, Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and, before going on the rostrum, he would always pray to the Gods, so as not to utter any improper word.

Nothing was more alien to the Greeks than the notion of a <a href="Separation%20between%20church%20and%20state">separation between Church and State</a>. In Athens, the community provided a tight framework for religious manifestations while, symmetrically, religion was deeply embedded in civic life. Within this context, participation in the rituals was an action highly political in the broadest sense of the term.

To analyze Pericles's relations with gods, one has to position oneself at the intersection of the general and the particular, where what was personal and what was shared by the whole community came together. On the one hand, the career of the "strategos" will illuminate the Athenians' collective relationship to all that was divine. As a reelected "strategos" and a persuasive orator, Pericles was the spokesman of a civic religion that was undergoing a mutation. He was implicated in a policy of making constant offerings and of launching huge architectural religious works not only on the Acropolis but also throughout Attica; and, furthermore, he was engaged in such activities at a time when city was introducing profound changes into its religious account of its origins—that is, <a href="Autochthon%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">autochthony</a>—within a context of strained diplomatic relations.

On the other hand, the ancient sources made it possible to glimpse the personal relations that Pericles had developed with gods. These were relations of proximity in the first place: he was sometimes depicted as a protégé of <a href="Athena">goddess Athena</a>, but in Attic comedies he was also assimilated to <a href="Zeus%20god%20of%20war">god Zeus</a>, in an analogy that was in no way flattering. But then, there were also relations that emphasized distance: some philosophical accounts presented him as a man close to the <a href="sophists">sophists</a> or even as a <a href="freethinker">freethinker</a>. Finally, there were relations involving irreverence: some later and less trustworthy sources made much of several trials for impiety in which those close to him were involved, and this raises the question of religious tolerance in fifth-century Athens and, in particular, how far individuals enjoyed freedom of thought when faced with the civic community.

Pericles' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age, most of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are "sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world".

In politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles' legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state. The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens. Pericles and his "expansionary" policies have been at the center of arguments promoting democracy in oppressed countries.

Other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age. The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period. Pericles is lauded as "the <a href="ideal%20type">ideal type</a> of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece" and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride.

Alain Prost

Alain Marie Pascal Prost (born 24 February 1955) is a retired French <a href="Auto%20racing">racing driver</a> and a four-time <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> Drivers' Champion. From 1987 until 2001 Prost held the record for most <a href="History%20of%20Formula%20One">Grand Prix</a> victories and is considered as one of the greatest F1 drivers ever. <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the <a href="2001%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">2001 Belgian Grand Prix</a>. In 1999, Prost received the "World Sports Awards of the Century" in the motor sport category.

Prost discovered <a href="Kart%20racing">karting</a> at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> championships, before joining the <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> Formula One team in <a href="1980%20Formula%20One%20season">1980</a> at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his <a href="1980%20Argentine%20Grand%20Prix">Formula One début</a> at the <a href="Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Juan%20y%20Oscar%20G%C3%A1lvez">San Martin Autodrome</a> in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> (where he took his first podium a year later) and took his first race victory at his home Grand Prix in <a href="1981%20French%20Grand%20Prix">France</a> a year later, driving for the factory <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a> team.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry mainly with <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>, but also <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a> and <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>. In 1986, at the <a href="1986%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">last race of the season</a>, he beat Mansell and Piquet of <a href="Williams%20F1">Williams</a> to the title after Mansell retired late on in the race, and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in <a href="1988%20Formula%20One%20season">1988</a> and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the <a href="1989%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">1989 Japanese Grand Prix</a> that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. <a href="1990%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">A year later at the same venue</a> they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, lost out. Before the end of a winless <a href="1991%20Formula%20One%20season">1991 season</a> Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical</a> in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning Drivers' Champion Mansell to leave for <a href="Champ%20Car">CART</a>. With a competitive car, Prost won the <a href="1993%20Formula%20One%20season">1993 championship</a> and retired from Formula One driving at the end of the year.

In 1997, Prost took over the French <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a> team, running it as <a href="Prost%20Grand%20Prix">Prost Grand Prix</a> until it went bankrupt in 2002. From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the <a href="Andros%20Trophy">Andros Trophy</a>, which is an <a href="ice%20racing">ice racing</a> championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship 3 times.

Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> and <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>. He was <a href="List%20of%20motorsports%20people%20by%20nickname">nickname</a>d "The Professor" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.

Alain Prost was born near the town of <a href="Saint-Chamond%2C%20Loire">Saint-Chamond</a>, close to the cities of <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> and <a href="Saint-Etienne">Saint-Etienne</a> in the <a href="d%C3%A9partement">département</a> of <a href="Loire%20%28department%29">Loire</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, to André Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> descent. Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> in September 1986. Although short, standing at 1.67 m (5 ft 6 in) Prost was an active, athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including <a href="wrestling">wrestling</a>, <a href="roller%20skating">roller skating</a> and <a href="association%20football">football</a>. In doing so he broke his nose several times. He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered <a href="kart%20racing">kart racing</a> at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.

Prost was married to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they divorced sometime later. They have two sons, <a href="Nicolas%20Prost">Nicolas</a> (born 18 August 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990). Prost also has a daughter, Victoria. From 2014 to 2018, Nicolas raced in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father. Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault team</a> fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to <a href="Sainte-Croix%2C%20Switzerland">Sainte-Croix, Switzerland</a>, and shortly after to <a href="Yens">Yens</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and another one of his road cars. They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to <a href="Nyon">Nyon</a> in the same country. In December 2015, Prost became a grandfather with the birth of Nicolas Prost's son Kimi.

In 1985 Prost was awarded the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27Honneur">Légion d'Honneur</a> by <a href="President%20of%20France">President</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>.

Prost won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974 he left school to become a full-time racer, supporting himself by tuning engines and becoming a kart distributor. His prize for winning the 1975 French senior karting championship was a season in French <a href="Formula%20Renault">Formula Renault</a>, a category in which he won the title and all but one race in 1976.

Prost went on to win the 1977 Formula Renault European championship before moving up to <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> (F3) in 1978. In 1979 he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams. After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> for <a href="1980%20Formula%20One%20season">1980</a>. He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the <a href="1979%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">final race of the 1979 season</a> at <a href="Watkins%20Glen%20International">Watkins Glen</a> — reasoning that the token effort would benefit neither him nor the team.

Prost began his career with <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> (being run by <a href="Teddy%20Mayer">Teddy Mayer</a>) in <a href="1980%20Formula%20One%20season">1980</a> alongside Ulsterman <a href="John%20Watson%20%28racing%20driver%29">John Watson</a>. On his debut in <a href="1980%20Argentine%20Grand%20Prix">Buenos Aires</a> he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by only a handful of drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at <a href="1980%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Interlagos</a>, <a href="1980%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Brands Hatch</a> and <a href="1980%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">Zandvoort</a>. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion <a href="Emerson%20Fittipaldi">Emerson Fittipaldi</a>. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at <a href="1980%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">Kyalami</a> and suffering a <a href="concussion%20of%20the%20brain">concussion</a> during practice at <a href="1980%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">Watkins Glen</a>. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.

Prost was partnered with <a href="Formula%20One%20drivers%20from%20France">fellow Frenchman</a> <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Arnoux">René Arnoux</a> for <a href="1981%20Formula%20One%20season">1981</a>. Motor sports author <a href="Nigel%20Roebuck">Nigel Roebuck</a> reports that there were problems between Prost and Arnoux from the start of the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate. He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with <a href="Andrea%20de%20Cesaris">Andrea de Cesaris</a> in <a href="1981%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix%20West">Long Beach</a> and <a href="Didier%20Pironi">Didier Pironi</a> at <a href="1981%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Jacarepaguá</a>, but scored his first <a href="Podium%23Usage%20in%20motorsport">podium finish</a> at <a href="1981%20Argentine%20Grand%20Prix">Buenos Aires</a>. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his <a href="1981%20French%20Grand%20Prix">home Grand Prix in France</a> at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.

For Prost, his debut victory was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. "Before, you thought you could do it," he said. "Now you know you can." Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> in <a href="1981%20German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany</a> and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a>.

Prost won the first two Grands Prix of the <a href="1982%20Formula%20One%20season">1982 season</a> in <a href="1982%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South Africa</a>, where Prost recovered from losing a wheel, and <a href="1982%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a>, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and <a href="Keke%20Rosberg">Keke Rosberg</a> (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the <a href="1982%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had made the mistake of winning! The French don't really like winners."

In November 1982, three years before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers <a href="Jacques%20Laffite">Jacques Laffite</a> and <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a>, made the trip to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> to drive in the non-championship <a href="1982%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1982 Australian Grand Prix</a> at the short (1.609 km (1.000 mi)) <a href="Calder%20Park%20Raceway">Calder Park Raceway</a>. Driving a <a href="Formula%20Pacific">Formula Pacific</a> spec <a href="Ralt">Ralt RT4</a> powered by a 1.6 litre <a href="Cosworth%23The%20BDA%20series">Ford engine</a>, Prost sat on pole for the race with a time of 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> wins. He finished 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with <a href="1981%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1981 AGP</a> winner, young Brazilian driver <a href="Roberto%20Moreno">Roberto Moreno</a> finishing third.

Arnoux left Renault in <a href="1983%20Formula%20One%20season">1983</a>, and <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="Eddie%20Cheever">Eddie Cheever</a> replaced him as Prost's partner allegedly because of Renault's desire to sell more road cars in North America (3 of the season's 15 races were on the North American continent). Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the Drivers' Championship, two points behind Nelson Piquet. Piquet and the <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> team overhauled Prost and Renault in the last few races of the season. Prost, who felt the team had been too conservative in developing the car, found himself increasingly at odds with Renault's management, who made him the scapegoat for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. Prost said in an interview with ESPN during <a href="1983%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">the final race</a> that his car was "not competitive" and that he "didn't lose by my own fault" Renault fired Prost only two days after the South African race. He re-signed for McLaren for the 1984 season within days and moved his family home to <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> after Renault factory workers burned the second of 2 of Prost's cars, one of them being a Mercedes-Benz.

The Frenchman joined double world champion <a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a> at McLaren (now being run by <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a>) in , driving the <a href="John%20Barnard">John Barnard</a> designed <a href="McLaren%20MP4/2">McLaren MP4/2</a> which used a 1.5 litre <a href="Techniques%20d%27Avant%20Garde">TAG</a>-<a href="Porsche%20in%20Formula%20One">Porsche</a> <a href="V6%20engine">V6 engine</a>. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the <a href="1984%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">final race</a> of the season in Portugal by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda's five, including winning in Portugal. The half point came from the <a href="1984%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>, where Prost had been leading, albeit with <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> (<a href="Toleman">Toleman</a>) and <a href="Stefan%20Bellof">Stefan Bellof</a> (<a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a>) closing on him rapidly, when Clerk of the Course <a href="Jacky%20Ickx">Jacky Ickx</a> stopped the race at half distance due to heavy rain, which was controversial as Ickx displayed the red flag without consulting the race officials. Under Formula One regulations, Prost received only half of the nine points normally awarded for a victory.

Prost's seven wins in 1984 equalled the record set by <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a> in .

In Prost became the first French Formula One <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Champion</a>. He won five of the sixteen Grands Prix during the season. He had also won the <a href="1985%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a>, but was disqualified after his car was found to be 2 kg underweight in post-race <a href="scrutineer">scrutineer</a>ing. Prost finished 20 points ahead of his closest rival, <a href="Michele%20Alboreto">Michele Alboreto</a>. Prost's performance in 1985 earned him the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> distinction in France.

Niki Lauda retired for good at the end of 1985, and was replaced at McLaren by World Champion <a href="Keke%20Rosberg">Keke Rosberg</a> for . Prost successfully defended his title, despite his car struggling against the <a href="Honda%20Racing%20F1">Honda</a>-powered Williams cars driven by Nelson Piquet and <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>. Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the <a href="1986%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a>, Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet's three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was all he needed to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at and crashed out. The <a href="Williams%20F1">Williams</a> team then pitted Piquet to change tyres as a safety precaution, while Prost had already pitted earlier due to a puncture and did not need to change his tyres again. He then held the lead ahead of a charging Piquet to the chequered flag and the Championship.

Another memorable race that year for Prost was at the <a href="1986%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a>. He was cruising to victory when his car began to run out of fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself ""shit, I am going to lose this race again"", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the <a href="1986%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the <a href="Brabham%20BT55">Brabham</a>-BMW of <a href="Derek%20Warwick">Derek Warwick</a>) was a lap behind.

With Rosberg retiring from Formula One at the end of 1986 season, underrated <a href="Swedes">Swede</a> <a href="Stefan%20Johansson">Stefan Johansson</a> filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new <a href="Steve%20Nichols">Steve Nichols</a> designed <a href="McLaren%20MP4/3">MP4/3</a> after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a>'s record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the <a href="1987%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">Portuguese Grand Prix</a>. Prost considers his win in the opening round in <a href="1987%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a> as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, the Frenchman went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive <a href="Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Internacional%20Nelson%20Piquet">Jacarepaguá Circuit</a> with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.

When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.

Prost finished the 1987 season in fourth place in the championship behind Piquet, Mansell and <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> driver <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson Piquet. Other than his debut season in 1980, and , it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.

Despite Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, Honda decided not to supply the team with their engines, partly due to Williams's refusal to dump <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> and hire Japanese driver and Honda test driver <a href="Satoru%20Nakajima">Satoru Nakajima</a> (who debuted with Lotus in 1987), and instead supplied the McLaren team for . Prost had convinced <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a> to sign Ayrton Senna to a three-year contract, which played a role in luring Honda (Senna's ability had been highly regarded by the Japanese giant when using their engines with Lotus in 1987 and both were keen to continue their association). However, this began the rivalry that pushed two of the sport's greatest drivers to unprecedented heights of success and controversy. McLaren-Honda dominated the season, winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost finished first or second in every race other than his two retirements at <a href="1988%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Silverstone</a> and <a href="1988%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Monza</a>. He won seven races and in total outscored his new teammate <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than Prost. However, only the 11 best results from the season counted toward the championship total, and this gave Senna the title by three points. Prost went on to be a proponent of essentially the 1990s scoring system – all results counting to the final results with the winner scoring 10, not 9, points.

In November of that year, Prost had a meeting with the head of Honda's R&D department and F1 racing program, <a href="Nobuhiko%20Kawamoto">Nobuhiko Kawamoto</a> in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.

McLaren's domination continued throughout , and the Prost-Senna struggle for supremacy put them on a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with the Frenchman accusing his Brazilian teammate of ""dangerous driving"" and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being in the pocket of <a href="FIA">FISA's</a> French president <a href="Jean-Marie%20Balestre">Jean-Marie Balestre</a>. The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in <a href="1989%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino</a>. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the <a href="Autodromo%20Enzo%20e%20Dino%20Ferrari">Imola</a> circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a>'s fiery crash in his <a href="Ferrari%20640">Ferrari</a>), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a friend of his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between himself and Prost, but the Frenchman's claim was backed up by <a href="Marlboro%20%28cigarette%29">Marlboro</a>'s John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.

Their embittered season ended as many pundits had feared. In the <a href="1989%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a> at the end of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casio Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path resulting in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the <a href="Race%20marshall">marshals</a> pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna <a href="bump%20starting">bump-started</a> the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the <a href="Benetton%20B189">Benetton</a> of <a href="Alessandro%20Nannini">Alessandro Nannini</a>. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.

However, Prost had the firm belief that Honda and <a href="Ron%20Dennis">Ron Dennis</a> viewed Senna as the future of the team. Prost recalled that by the <a href="1989%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him. Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>. Although Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments, he received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's <a href="McLaren%20MP4/5">MP4/5</a> had not been a match for Senna's on <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a>'s long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.

As 1989 wore on, Prost continually claimed his Honda <a href="V10%20engine">V10</a>s were not producing the same amount of power as those in Senna's car. It actually got to the point where Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the <a href="1989%20Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a>. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came off the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a <a href="Slipstream%23Drafting">tow</a>. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.


Prost signed to join Ferrari in 1990 becoming the first driver signed to the team after the death of team founder <a href="Enzo%20Ferrari">Enzo Ferrari</a> in 1988. The Frenchman replaced <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a> at Ferrari and was partnered with Britain's <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> for <a href="1990%20Formula%20One%20season">1990</a> (Berger took Prost's seat at McLaren). As reigning world champion, Prost took over as the team's lead driver and was said to have played on Mansell's <a href="inferiority%20complex">inferiority complex</a>. Mansell recalls one incident where at the <a href="1990%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1990 British Grand Prix</a>, the car he drove didn't handle the same as in the previous race where he had taken pole position, and later found out from team mechanics that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and had them swapped without Mansell knowing. Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in <a href="1990%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a>, <a href="1990%20Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexico</a>, <a href="1990%20French%20Grand%20Prix">France</a>, <a href="1990%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Britain</a> and <a href="1990%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spain</a>. Notable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won after starting in 13th position. In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he led Mansell to Ferrari 1–2 finishes. The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in <a href="1990%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japan</a> with Prost trailing his McLaren adversary, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. As in 1989, a controversial collision between the two settled the race. At the first corner Senna, as admitted a year later, intentionally drove his race car into Prost's, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title in his favour. "What he did was disgusting," Prost said. "He is a man without value." Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were runners-up to McLaren.


Mansell left the Scuderia due to his unstable relationship with Prost, to rejoin Williams for the <a href="1991%20Formula%20One%20season">1991 Formula One season</a>. Mansell's replacement was Frenchman <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a>, who had been impressive during the previous two years at <a href="Tyrrell%20Racing">Tyrrell</a>. Ferrari had entered a downturn, partially as their famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of their competitors. The Ferrari chassis, despite a major revision by the French Grand Prix (F-643) was also not up to the level of the McLaren and the Williams models. Prost won no races, only getting onto the podium five times. He took this out on the team, publicly criticising the team and the <a href="Ferrari%20643">Ferrari 643</a>, and subsequently had his contract terminated before the end of the season, immediately prior to the <a href="1991%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Italy">Italian</a> driver <a href="Gianni%20Morbidelli">Gianni Morbidelli</a> for the final race of the 1991 season and by another Italian, <a href="Ivan%20Capelli">Ivan Capelli</a>, for the following season. Despite being sacked, Prost received a significant payment from Ferrari to not drive for any other team.

It was the second time in his career that Prost had been fired by a factory backed team for his public criticism of the team and car, having been fired under similar circumstances by Renault at the end of the 1983 season.

1991 was the first time since his debut year in 1980 in which Prost did not win a Formula One Grands Prix.

Prost went on a <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical year</a> in <a href="1992%20Formula%20One%20season">1992</a>, which was dominated by <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> in a Williams-<a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the <a href="Champ%20car">CART</a> series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> from joining the team that year. Prost was part of a new-look driver line-up at Williams, with test driver <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a> coming in to replace <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a>, who had left to join <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a>.

Prost won his fourth, and final, title, but in a year where he was regularly challenged by teammate Hill, and <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>. Shortly before the <a href="1993%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">Portuguese Grand Prix</a> in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna would be able to join Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most Grand Prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in <a href="1993%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Adelaide</a> in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake the race before. Prost's performances earned him an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a>.

<a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> broke Prost's record of 51 Grand Prix wins during the <a href="2001%20Formula%20One%20season">2001 season</a>. However, the Frenchman still holds the records for the most Grand Prix starts in <a href="turbo%20charger">turbo</a> powered cars (126), most wins at home Grand Prix (six at the <a href="French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>) and wins with most different teams (4: <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a>, <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>, <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>, and <a href="Williams%20F1">Williams</a>). He also shares the record for starting every race of the season from the front row (16 in ), with Ayrton Senna in , and Damon Hill in .

He is also thus far the most recent Frenchman to win his home Grand Prix.

Prost's battles with <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> were particularly notable. The rivalry originated in <a href="1988%20Formula%20One%20season">1988</a>, when Senna joined Prost at the <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> team. The most notable event during the season between the two occurred during the <a href="1988%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">Portuguese Grand Prix</a>, where Senna tried to block Prost from taking the lead by forcing the Frenchman to run close to the pit wall at around ; Prost managed to edge Senna outwards, taking the lead as they went into the first corner but he remained angered by the Brazilian's manoeuvre.

The rivalry intensified after the <a href="1989%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">1989 San Marino Grand Prix</a>, where the two drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner ("cf." <a href="1982%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">1982 San Marino Grand Prix</a>). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. <a href="Gerhard%20Berger">Gerhard Berger</a>'s crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time that got away the better of the two; but Senna forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement at the start of the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna. Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> the following season.

The rivalry reached its peak at the end of 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at <a href="1989%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Suzuka</a>. The two McLarens collided at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna went on to win the race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading Senna to accuse FIA president <a href="Jean-Marie%20Balestre">Jean-Marie Balestre</a> of favouring his <a href="compatriot">compatriot</a> Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically impossible for him to overhaul Prost's points total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman. There has been much debate as to whether Senna was overambitious in his overtaking manoeuver, whether Prost intentionally ran into Senna, or whether the collision was simply a racing incident between two teammates who were embittered with each other.

The <a href="1990%20Formula%20One%20season">following season</a> saw the two drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in the world Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the <a href="1990%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">penultimate race of the season in Suzuka</a> with Senna on pole. Between the end of qualifying and race day, pole position was switched to the other side of the track without explanation. Senna complained that no longer being on the <a href="racing%20line">racing line</a>, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected. At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two; but whilst braking for the first corner, Senna refused to back off and collided with Prost at , clinching the title for the Brazilian. Prost almost retired from the sport, saying "What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value." A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.

There was another controversial incident in <a href="1991%20Formula%20One%20season">1991</a>. Prost's inferior Ferrari was unable to put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the <a href="1991%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix at Hockenheim</a>, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point. At the following race, in <a href="1991%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungary</a>, the FIA ordered a sit-down meeting between the two men, keen on not having any repeats of the incidents from the previous two years.

The Frenchman took a sabbatical in <a href="1992%20Formula%20One%20season">1992</a> after being fired from Ferrari for publicly criticizing the car and the team, while the Brazilian struggled as McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna had wanted to join Williams too, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract forbidding the Brazilian as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a "coward" during a press conference at <a href="Estoril%20Circuit">Estoril</a>, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms: I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race anybody, at any condition, at equal terms.

During the <a href="1993%20Formula%20One%20season">1993 season</a>, Prost and Senna continued their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the <a href="1993%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">1993 Brazilian Grand Prix</a> due to the hostility of Brazilians towards him. The two continued their on-track battles at <a href="1993%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Silverstone</a> where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost. At Prost's last Grand Prix, the <a href="1993%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1993 Australian Grand Prix</a>, he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.

On 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna <a href="Death%20of%20Ayrton%20Senna">was killed</a> during the <a href="1994%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a>. Prost was a <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a> at the Brazilian's funeral. Speaking four years after the Brazilian's death, Prost told <a href="Nigel%20Roebuck">Nigel Roebuck</a> that he had "always refused to speak about him". When Senna died, Prost stated that "a part of himself had died also", because their careers had been so bound together. Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel <a href="TF1">TF1</a>, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: "A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain. We all miss you Alain." Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.

Prost uses a helmet design based on the three colours of the <a href="Flag%20of%20France">French flag</a>, those being blue, white and red, along with his name along the side. During his early career however, Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180° flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, surrounding the top). During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half in the rear of the top). . Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.
Sometimes Prost used variants of his helmet design. In 2007 he used his original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe on the visor, designed by Kaos Design.

During 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as TV pundit for the French TV channel <a href="TF1">TF1</a>. He also worked for <a href="Renault">Renault</a> as a <a href="public%20relations">PR man</a>. Prost went back to his old team <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>, working as a technical adviser; he also completed <a href="L%27Etape%20du%20Tour">L'Etape du Tour</a>, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>. Although not an official race, riders fight hard for places; Prost finished 12th in his category, 42nd overall out of over 5000 riders.

During 1989 Prost began to contemplate starting his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and <a href="John%20Barnard">John Barnard</a>, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a>. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with <a href="Guy%20Ligier">Guy Ligier</a> about buying his <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a> team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. By 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people had assumed that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.

On 13 February 1997, Prost bought the Ligier team from <a href="Flavio%20Briatore">Flavio Briatore</a> and renamed it "Prost Grand Prix". The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer <a href="Peugeot">Peugeot</a>, who would supply the team with engines from until . For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, <a href="Olivier%20Panis">Olivier Panis</a>, who had won the <a href="1996%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> the previous year; <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese driver <a href="Shinji%20Nakano">Shinji Nakano</a> was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the <a href="Mugen-Honda">Mugen-Honda</a> engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended <a href="Prost%20JS45">Ligier JS45</a>, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in <a href="1997%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australia</a> when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the <a href="1997%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Minardi">Minardi</a>'s <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a>. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis's recovery. The Frenchman came back at the end of the season to race the final three Grand Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship in its first season, with 21 points.

Prost became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of 1998. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan</a> team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season, Jarno Trulli finishing sixth in <a href="1998%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgium</a>.

Peugeot's final year as Prost's engine supplier in 2000 saw some optimism, Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari teammate <a href="Jean%20Alesi">Jean Alesi</a> to drive the lead car and <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Nick%20Heidfeld">Nick Heidfeld</a>, who had won the <a href="1999%20Formula%203000%20season">1999</a> <a href="International%20Formula%203000">Formula 3000</a> championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one, with the <a href="Prost%20AP03">AP03</a> proving to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when both drivers collided with each other in the <a href="2000%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austrian Grand Prix</a>. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.

During 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the "Granite – Mont Lozère". The Frenchman raced in the <a href="Andros%20Trophy">Andros ice race series</a> in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind <a href="Yvan%20Muller">Yvan Muller</a>; he also became an Ambassador for <a href="Uniroyal">Uniroyal</a>, a position he would keep until May 2006.

Prost continued to compete in the Andros Trophy, winning the title with Toyota in 2006/07, 2007/08 and with Dacia in 2011/2012.

For the <a href="2010%20Formula%20One%20season">2010 Formula One season</a>, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards' panel. Prost was the first such driver to take on this role, at the <a href="2010%20Bahrain%20Grand%20Prix">2010 Bahrain Grand Prix</a>. Prost also took part in the Race of Champions in 2010, a race organised for legends of motor sport to compete in equal machinery.

In February 2012, Prost was named as Renault's new international ambassador, representing the company in sports demonstrations and at events organized or attended by Renault.

Prost has finished the Absa <a href="Cape%20Epic">Cape Epic</a>, an eight-day 700 km mountain bike race in South Africa, twice. He first completed the race in 2012 with partner Sebastien di Pasqua and then again in 2013, and started but did not finish the race in 2014.

In October 2013 it was announced that Prost would join forces with Jean-Paul Driot's <a href="DAMS">DAMS</a> racing team to form e.dams, a team which would compete in the <a href="FIA%20Formula%20E%20Championship">FIA Formula E Championship</a> for electric racing cars from its commencement in September 2014. In June 2014 the team announced that its initial driver line-up would consist of Nicolas Prost and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Buemi">Sébastien Buemi</a>. The team went on to win the inaugural Formula E teams championship. In 2017 it was announced that Prost would be hired as a special adviser for the Renault Formula One Team.

 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.<br>

Harriet Tubman

Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, March 10, 1913) was an American <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> and political activist. Born into <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. She later helped abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> recruit men for <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">his raid</a> on <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry</a>. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, she served as an armed scout and <a href="American%20Civil%20War%20spies%23Union">spy</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the struggle for <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>.

Born a slave in <a href="Dorchester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Dorchester County, Maryland</a>, Tubman was beaten and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of <a href="hypersomnia">hypersomnia</a>, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.

In 1849, Tubman escaped to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, then immediately returned to Maryland to rescue her family. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other slaves to freedom. Traveling by night and in extreme secrecy, Tubman (or "<a href="Moses">Moses</a>", as she was called) "never lost a passenger". After the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a> was passed, she helped guide fugitives farther north into <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>, and helped newly freed slaves find work. Tubman met the abolitionist John Brown in 1858, and helped him plan and recruit supporters for the raid on Harpers Ferry.

When the Civil War began, Tubman worked for the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, she guided the <a href="raid%20at%20Combahee%20Ferry">raid at Combahee Ferry</a>, which liberated more than 700 slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn, New York</a>, where she cared for her aging parents. She was active in the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> that she had helped to establish years earlier. After she died in 1913, she became an icon of courage and freedom.

Tubman was born Araminta "Minty" Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit was owned by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> near <a href="Blackwater%20River%20%28Maryland%29">Blackwater River</a> in <a href="Madison%2C%20Maryland">Madison, Maryland</a>. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. <a href="Kate%20Larson">Kate Larson</a> records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have been a year or two later." <a href="Catherine%20Clinton">Catherine Clinton</a> notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War <a href="widow%27s%20pension">widow's pension</a> records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she herself had only a general idea of when she was born.
Modesty, Tubman's maternal grandmother, arrived in the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she seemed like an <a href="Ashanti%20people">Ashanti</a> person because of her character traits, though no evidence exists to confirm this lineage. Her mother Rit (who may have had a white father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.

Rit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and <a href="free%20negro">free blacks</a> in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and "the Georgia man" came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, "You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open." Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.

Tubman's mother was assigned to "the big house" and had scarce time for her family; consequently, as a child Tubman took care of a younger brother and baby, as was typical in large families. When she was five or six years old, Brodess hired her out as a nursemaid to a woman named "Miss Susan." She was ordered to keep watch on the baby as it slept; when it woke up and cried, she was whipped. She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast. She carried the scars for the rest of her life. She found ways to resist, running away for five days, wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back.

As a child, Tubman also worked at the home of a <a href="Planter%20%28American%20South%29">planter</a> named James Cook. She had to check the <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a> traps in nearby marshes, even after contracting <a href="measles">measles</a>. She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health. Brodess then hired her out again. She spoke later of her acute childhood <a href="homesickness">homesickness</a>, comparing herself to "the boy on the Swanee River", an allusion to <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a>'s song "<a href="Old%20Folks%20at%20Home">Old Folks at Home</a>." As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.

As an illiterate child, she had been told <a href="Bible">Bible</a> stories by her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected the teachings of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">visions</a> and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as <a href="revelation">revelation</a>s from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life. As conductor of the <a href="underground%20railroad">underground railroad</a>, Harriet Tubman used songs to link themes of travel, heavenly salvation, and deliverance from earthly bondage: "the promised land" meant Canada, and "Egypt" stood for the slave states. She sang “Go Down Moses” to warn fugitives to stay hidden, but as she led them across the border, Tubman, known as "Moses" to her friends, called out, “Glory to God in the highest. One more soul is safe!”

As a child in <a href="Dorchester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Dorchester County, Maryland</a>, Tubman was beaten by masters to whom she was hired out. Early in her life, she suffered a severe <a href="Head%20injury">head wound</a> when hit by a heavy metal weight. The injury caused disabling epileptic seizures, <a href="headache">headache</a>s, powerful visions, and dream experiences, which occurred throughout her life.

The adolescent Tubman had been sent to a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said "broke my skull." She later explained her belief that her hair – which "had never been combed and ... stood out like a bushel basket" – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." Her boss said she was "not worth a sixpence" and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her for the rest of her life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from <a href="temporal%20lobe%20epilepsy">temporal lobe epilepsy</a> as a result of the injury.

By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was <a href="manumitted">manumitted</a> from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>, though his actual age was closer to 55. He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.

Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status. <a href="Partus%20sequitur%20ventrum">The mother's status</a> dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – <a href="free%20people%20of%20color">free people of color</a> marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.

Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative.

In 1849, Tubman became ill again, which diminished her value as a slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for continuing to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways. She said later: "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me." When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, "I changed my prayer," she said. "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'" A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.

As in many estate settlements, Brodess's death increased the likelihood that Tubman would be sold and her family broken apart. His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's slaves. Tubman refused to wait for the Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her. "[T]here was one of two things I had a right to," she explained later, "liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other."

Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, escaped from slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman had been hired out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large plantation in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Maryland">Cambridge</a> "Democrat", offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.

Soon afterward, Tubman escaped again, this time without her brothers. Beforehand, she tried to send word to her mother of her plans. She sang a coded song to Mary, a trusted fellow slave, that was a farewell. "I'll meet you in the morning," she intoned, "I'm bound for the promised land." While her exact route is unknown, Tubman made use of the network known as the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. This informal but well-organized system was composed of free and enslaved blacks, white abolitionists, and other activists. Most prominent among the latter in Maryland at the time were members of the <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a>, often called Quakers. The Preston area near Poplar Neck in Caroline County contained a substantial Quaker community, and was probably an important first stop during Tubman's escape. From there, she probably took a common route for fleeing slaves – northeast along the <a href="Choptank%20River">Choptank River</a>, through <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> and then north into <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. A journey of nearly 90 miles (145 kilometers), her traveling by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks.

Tubman had to travel by night, guided by the <a href="Polaris">North Star</a>, and trying to avoid slave catchers eager to collect rewards for <a href="fugitive%20slaves">fugitive slaves</a>. The "conductors" in the Underground Railroad used deceptions for protection. At an early stop, the lady of the house instructed Tubman to sweep the yard so as to seem to be working for the family. When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house. Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman during the day likely hid in these locales. Tubman only later described her routes because other fugitive slaves used them.

Particulars of her first journey remain shrouded in secrecy. She crossed into Pennsylvania with a feeling of relief and awe, and recalled the experience years later:

In honor of her courageous efforts to rescue family and friends from slavery, abolitionist <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> named her "Moses", alluding to <a href="Moses">the prophet</a> in the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> who led the <a href="Hebrews">Hebrews</a> to freedom from Egypt. Though nicknamed "Moses", Tubman's daring missions to Maryland remained virtually unknown, and her identity was a carefully guarded secret. She did sing a version of "<a href="Go%20Down%20Moses">Go Down Moses</a>" to signal to her refugees along the path to freedom—she changed the tempo to indicate that it was either safe or too dangerous to proceed. Like other Underground Railroad conductors, Tubman used various methods of communication specific to her own needs. Contrary to current popular belief, there were no common "codes" used by conductors. In the north, however, the song "Go Down Moses" was openly sung by <a href="54th%20Massachusetts%20Infantry%20Regiment">Black regiments</a> during the Civil War. After the war, various black-faced minstrels included the song in their acts which helped popularize it. During the 20th century, people of all races sang it as a spiritual to pay tribute to Tubman or to various struggles for freedom. 

After reaching <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Tubman thought of her family. "I was a stranger in a strange land," she said later. "[M]y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were [in Maryland]. But I was free, and "they" should be free." She worked odd jobs and saved money. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> meanwhile passed the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Law%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Law of 1850</a>, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">United Province of Canada</a>), which, as part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish <a href="immigrants">immigrants</a> competed with free blacks for work.

In December 1850, Tubman was warned that her niece Kessiah and her two children, six-year-old James Alfred, and baby Araminta, soon would be sold in Cambridge. Tubman went to <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, where her brother-in-law Tom Tubman hid her until the sale. Kessiah's husband, a free black man named John Bowley, made the winning bid for his wife. Then, while the auctioneer stepped away to have lunch, John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby <a href="safe%20house">safe house</a>. When night fell, Bowley sailed the family on a <a href="log%20canoe">log canoe</a> to Baltimore, where they met with Tubman, who brought the family to Philadelphia.

The next spring she returned to Maryland to help guide away other family members. During her second trip, she recovered her brother Moses and two unidentified men. Tubman likely worked with abolitionist <a href="Thomas%20Garrett">Thomas Garrett</a>, a Quaker working in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a>. Word of her exploits had encouraged her family, and biographers agree that with each trip to Maryland, she became more confident.

While being interviewed by author <a href="Wilbur%20Henry%20Siebert">Wilbur Siebert</a> in 1897, Tubman named some of the people who helped her and places that she stayed along the Underground Railroad. She stayed with Sam Green, a free black minister living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents' home at Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland. She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington. In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to <a href="William%20Still">William Still</a>'s office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area. Still, a famous black agent, is credited with aiding hundreds of freedom seekers escape to safer places farther north in New York, New England, and present-day Southern Ontario.

In the fall of 1851, Tubman returned to <a href="Dorchester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Dorchester County</a> for the first time since her escape, this time to find her husband, John. She once again saved money from various jobs, purchased a suit for him, and made her way south. John, meanwhile, had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth the trouble. Suppressing her anger, she found some slaves who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia. John and Caroline raised a family together, until he was killed 16 years later in a roadside argument with a white man named Robert Vincent.
Because the Fugitive Slave Law had made the northern United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is evidence to suggest that Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>. In his <a href="Life%20and%20Times%20of%20Frederick%20Douglass">third autobiography</a>, Douglass wrote: "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter. ... " The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.

Douglass and Tubman admired one another greatly as they both struggled against slavery. When an early biography of Tubman was being prepared in 1868, Douglass wrote a letter to honor her. It read in part:

Over eleven years, Tubman returned repeatedly to the <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Maryland">Eastern Shore of Maryland</a>, rescuing some 70 slaves in about thirteen expeditions, including her three other brothers, Henry, Ben, and Robert, their wives and some of their children. She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60 additional fugitives who escaped to the north. Tubman's dangerous work required tremendous ingenuity; she usually worked during winter months, to minimize the likelihood that the group would be seen. One admirer of Tubman said: "She always came in the winter, when the nights are long and dark, and people who have homes stay in them." Once she had made contact with escaping slaves, they left town on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning.
Her journeys into the land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she used a variety of subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a <a href="Bonnet%20%28headgear%29">bonnet</a> and carried two live <a href="chickens">chickens</a> to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.

Tubman's religious faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and she saw them as divine <a href="premonitions">premonitions</a>. She spoke of "consulting with God", and trusted that He would keep her safe. Thomas Garrett once said of her, "I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God, as spoken direct to her soul." Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance. She used <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a> as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path.

Tubman also carried a <a href="revolver">revolver</a>, and was not afraid to use it. The gun afforded some protection from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs; however, she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten the safety of the remaining group. Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted he was going to go back to the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves. She pointed the gun at his head and said, "You go on or die." Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.

Slaveholders in the region, meanwhile, never knew that "Minty", the petite, five-foot-tall, disabled slave who had run away years before and never come back, was behind so many slave escapes in their community. By the late 1850s, they began to suspect a northern white abolitionist was secretly enticing their slaves away. They considered that <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> himself had come to the Eastern Shore to lure slaves away before his ill-fated raid on <a href="Harper%27s%20Ferry">Harper's Ferry</a> in October 1859.

While a popular legend persists about a reward of US$40,000 for Tubman's capture, this is a manufactured figure. In 1868, in an effort to drum up support for Tubman's claim for a Civil War military pension, a former abolitionist named Salley Holley wrote an article claiming US$40,000 "was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her". Such a high reward would have garnered national attention, especially at a time when a small farm could be purchased for a mere US$400. No such reward has been found in period newspapers. (The federal government offered $25,000 for the capture of each of <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>'s co-conspirators in Lincoln's assassination.) A reward offering of US$12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation exists for that figure either. Catherine Clinton suggests that the US$40,000 figure may have been a combined total of the various <a href="Bounty%20%28reward%29">bounties</a> offered around the region.

Despite the best efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: "I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.

In April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a>, an <a href="Insurgency">insurgent</a> who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.
Thus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by "General Tubman", as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.

On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in <a href="Chatham%2C%20Ontario">Chatham, Ontario</a>, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry, Virginia</a>. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort, and with more detailed plans for the assault.

Tubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives. In the autumn of 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose she may have been recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.

The raid failed; Brown was convicted of <a href="treason">treason</a> and hanged in December. His actions were seen by abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr. Tubman herself was effusive with praise. She later told a friend: "[H]e done more in dying, than 100 men would in living."

In early 1859, abolitionist Republican U.S. Senator <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> sold Tubman a small piece of land on the outskirts of <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn, New York</a>, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. <a href="Catherine%20Clinton">Catherine Clinton</a> suggests that anger over the 1857 <a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott decision</a> may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.

Shortly after acquiring the Auburn property, Tubman went back to Maryland and returned with her "niece," an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret. The circumstances of this expedition remain clouded in mystery. There is great confusion about the identity of Margaret's parents, although Tubman indicated they were free blacks. The girl had left behind a twin brother and a loving home in Maryland. Years later, Margaret's daughter Alice called Tubman's actions selfish, saying, "she had taken the child from a sheltered good home to a place where there was nobody to care for her." Indeed, Alice described it as a "kidnapping".

However, both Clinton and Larson present the possibility that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson points out that the two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.

In November 1860, Tubman conducted her last rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman had been unable to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with <a href="paregoric">paregoric</a> to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and <a href="Martha%20Coffin%20Wright">Martha Wright</a> in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.

When the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> broke out in 1861, Tubman saw a <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> victory as a key step toward the abolition of slavery. General <a href="Benjamin%20Butler">Benjamin Butler</a>, for instance, aided escaped slaves flooding into <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>. Butler had declared these fugitives to be "<a href="Contraband%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">contraband</a>" – property seized by northern forces – and put them to work, initially without pay, in the fort. Tubman hoped to offer her own expertise and skills to the Union cause, too, and soon she joined a group of Boston and Philadelphia abolitionists heading to the Hilton Head District in South Carolina. She became a fixture in the camps, particularly in <a href="Port%20Royal%2C%20South%20Carolina">Port Royal, South Carolina</a>, assisting fugitives.

Tubman met with General <a href="David%20Hunter">David Hunter</a>, a strong supporter of abolition. He declared all of the "contrabands" in the Port Royal district free, and began gathering former slaves for a regiment of black soldiers. U.S. President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, however, was not prepared to enforce emancipation on the southern states, and reprimanded Hunter for his actions. Tubman condemned Lincoln's response and his general unwillingness to consider ending slavery in the U.S., for both moral and practical reasons. "God won't let master Lincoln beat the South till he does "the right thing"," she said.

Tubman served as a nurse in Port Royal, preparing remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. She rendered assistance to men with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>; that she did not contract the disease herself started more rumors that she was blessed by God. At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.

When President Lincoln finally issued the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> in January 1863, Tubman considered it an important step toward the goal of liberating all black men, women, and children from slavery. She renewed her support for a defeat of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina were similar to those of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were put to good use. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a>, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and <a href="Reconnaissance">reconnoitered</a> its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel <a href="James%20Montgomery%20%28colonel%29">James Montgomery</a>, and provided him with key intelligence that aided the capture of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.
Later that year, Tubman became the first woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War. When Montgomery and his troops conducted an <a href="Raid%20at%20Combahee%20Ferry">assault on a collection of plantations</a> along the <a href="Combahee%20River">Combahee River</a>, Tubman served as a key adviser and accompanied the raid. On the morning of June 2, 1863, Tubman guided three steamboats around Confederate mines in the waters leading to the shore. Once ashore, the Union troops set fire to the plantations, destroying infrastructure and seizing thousands of dollars worth of food and supplies. When the steamboats sounded their whistles, slaves throughout the area understood that it was being liberated. Tubman watched as slaves stampeded toward the boats. "I never saw such a sight," she said later, describing a scene of chaos with women carrying still-steaming pots of rice, pigs squealing in bags slung over shoulders, and babies hanging around their parents' necks. Although their owners, armed with handguns and whips, tried to stop the mass escape, their efforts were nearly useless in the tumult. As Confederate troops raced to the scene, steamboats packed full of slaves took off toward <a href="Beaufort%2C%20South%20Carolina">Beaufort</a>.

More than 750 slaves were rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [and] ability", and she was praised for her recruiting efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel <a href="Robert%20Gould%20Shaw">Robert Gould Shaw</a> at the assault on <a href="Fort%20Wagner">Fort Wagner</a>, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: "And then we saw the lightning, and that was the guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped."

For two more years, Tubman worked for the Union forces, tending to newly liberated slaves, scouting into Confederate territory, and nursing wounded soldiers in Virginia. She also made periodic trips back to Auburn, to visit her family and care for her parents. The Confederacy surrendered in April 1865; after donating several more months of service, Tubman headed home to Auburn, New York.

During a train ride to New York, the conductor told her to move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she clutched at the railing, they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.

Despite her years of service, she had never received a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her in a state of constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.

Tubman spent her remaining years in Auburn, tending to her family and other people in need. She worked various jobs to support her elderly parents, and took in boarders to help pay the bills. One of the people Tubman took in was a 5-foot, 11 inch tall farmer born in North Carolina named Nelson Charles Davis. He was a veteran of the <a href="8th%20United%20States%20Colored%20Infantry">8th United States Colored Infantry</a>, serving as a private in the unit from September 1863 to the late summer of 1865. He began working in Auburn as a <a href="bricklayer">bricklayer</a>, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years younger than she was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874, and lived together as a family; Nelson died on October 14, 1888 of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

Tubman's friends and supporters from the days of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, <a href="Sarah%20Hopkins%20Bradford">Sarah Hopkins Bradford</a>, wrote an authorized biography entitled "Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman". The 132-page volume was published in 1869, and brought Tubman some US$1,200 in revenue. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless remains an important source of information and perspective on Tubman's life. Bradford released another volume in 1886 called "Harriet, the Moses of her People", which presented a less caustic view of slavery and the South. It, too, was published as a way to help alleviate Tubman's poverty.

Facing accumulated debts (including payments for her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson and the other John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her to go along with the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.

New York responded with outrage to the incident, and while some criticized Tubman for her naïveté, most sympathized with her economic hardship and lambasted the con men. The incident refreshed the public's memory of her past service and her economic woes. <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representatives</a> <a href="Clinton%20D.%20MacDougall">Clinton D. MacDougall</a> of New York and <a href="Gerry%20Whiting%20Hazelton">Gerry W. Hazelton</a> of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> introduced a bill (H.R. 2711/3786) providing that Tubman be paid "the sum of $2,000 for services rendered by her to the Union Army as scout, nurse, and spy". It was defeated.

In 1898, Tubman petitioned the Congress for benefits for her own service in the Civil War, outlining her "responsibilities during the war" as she was still receiving the pension of her deceased husband, Nelson Davis, payments of which had begun in 1895 after it was originally denied. By 1899, after receiving numerous documents and letters to support Tubman's claims, the U.S. Congress passed and President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> signed H.R. 4982, a law which "authorized an increase of Tubman's pension to twenty dollars per month for her service as a nurse."

In her later years, Tubman worked to promote the cause of <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>. A white woman once asked Tubman whether she believed women ought to have the vote, and received the reply: "I suffered enough to believe it." Tubman began attending meetings of <a href="History%20of%20women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">suffragist</a> organizations, and was soon working alongside women such as <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> and <a href="Emily%20Howland">Emily Howland</a>.

Tubman traveled to New York, <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, to speak out in favor of women's voting rights. She described her actions during and after the Civil War, and used the sacrifices of countless women throughout modern history as evidence of women's equality to men. When the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Colored%20Women%27s%20Clubs">National Federation of Afro-American Women</a> was founded in 1896, Tubman was the keynote speaker at its first meeting.

This wave of activism kindled a new wave of admiration for Tubman among the press in the United States. A publication called "<a href="The%20Woman%27s%20Era">The Woman's Era</a>" launched a series of articles on "Eminent Women" with a profile of Tubman. An 1897 suffragist newspaper reported a series of receptions in Boston honoring Tubman and her lifetime of service to the nation. However, her endless contributions to others had left her in poverty, and she had to sell a cow to buy a train ticket to these celebrations.

At the turn of the 20th century, Tubman became heavily involved with the <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Zion%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church</a> in Auburn. In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for "aged and indigent colored people". The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: "[T]hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't have no money at all." She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Home%20for%20the%20Aged">Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged</a> celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.

As Tubman aged, the seizures, headaches, and suffering from her childhood head trauma continued to plague her. At some point in the late 1890s, she underwent <a href="brain%20surgery">brain surgery</a> at Boston's <a href="Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>. Unable to sleep because of pains and "buzzing" in her head, she asked a doctor if he could operate. He agreed and, in her words, "sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable". She had received no <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a> for the procedure and reportedly chose instead to <a href="Bite%20the%20bullet">bite down on a bullet</a>, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were <a href="amputation">amputated</a>.

By 1911, her body was so frail that she had to be admitted into the rest home named in her honor. A New York newspaper described her as "ill and penniless", prompting supporters to offer a new round of donations. Surrounded by friends and family members, Harriet Tubman died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in 1913. Just before she died, she told those in the room: "I go to prepare a place for you."
When she died, Tubman was buried with semi-military honors at <a href="Fort%20Hill%20Cemetery">Fort Hill Cemetery</a> in Auburn.

Harriet Tubman, widely known and well-respected while she was alive, became an American icon in the years after she died. A survey at the end of the 20th century named her as one of the most famous civilians in American history before the Civil War, third only to <a href="Betsy%20Ross">Betsy Ross</a> and <a href="Paul%20Revere">Paul Revere</a>. She inspired generations of <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> struggling for equality and <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil rights</a>; she was praised by leaders across the political spectrum.
When she died, Tubman was buried with semi-military honors at <a href="Fort%20Hill%20Cemetery">Fort Hill Cemetery</a> in Auburn. The city commemorated her life with a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of <a href="African-American%20English">dialect</a> ("I nebber run my train off de track"), apparently chosen for its authenticity, has been criticized for undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.

Tubman was celebrated in many other ways throughout the nation in the 20th century. Dozens of schools were named in her honor, and both the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn and the Harriet Tubman Museum in Cambridge serve as monuments to her life. In 1937 the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Grave">gravestone for Harriet Tubman Davis</a> was erected by the Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs; it was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1999. In 1944, the <a href="United%20States%20Maritime%20Commission">United States Maritime Commission</a> launched the "<a href="SS%20Harriet%20Tubman">SS Harriet Tubman</a>", its first <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a> ever named for a black woman. In 1973, Tubman was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a>. In 1978, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> issued a stamp in honor of Tubman which made her the first African-American woman to be honored on a US Postage stamp. In March 2013, President Barack Obama signed a proclamation creating <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Underground%20Railroad%20National%20Monument">Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument</a> on the Eastern Shore.
In 1985, Tubman was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Maryland%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Maryland Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

Tubman is commemorated together with <a href="Elizabeth%20Cady%20Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, <a href="Amelia%20Bloomer">Amelia Bloomer</a>, and <a href="Sojourner%20Truth">Sojourner Truth</a> in the <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America%29">calendar of saints</a> of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church</a> on July 20. The <a href="Calendar%20of%20Saints%20%28Lutheran%29">calendar of saints</a> of the <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> remembers Tubman and Sojurner Truth on March 10.

In 1999, the Canadian government designated the Salem Chapel, <a href="British%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">British Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in St. Catharines a <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Site</a> because of its association with Tubman. In the same year, the city of <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, Massachusetts, erected a <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Memorial%20%28Cunningham%29">statue</a> to Tubman; it was the first memorial to a woman on city-owned land.

In 2002, scholar <a href="Molefi%20Kete%20Asante">Molefi Kete Asante</a> included Harriet Tubman on his list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20African%20Americans">100 Greatest African Americans</a>. In 2008, <a href="Towson%20University">Towson University</a> named a new residence hall after Tubman. A <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Memorial">statue of Tubman</a> was unveiled in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 2008, and another on the campus of <a href="Salisbury%20University">Salisbury University</a> in 2009.

In 2003, Congress approved a payment of $11,750 of widow's pension owed to Harriet Tubman.

In 2014, the asteroid was named after Harriet Tubman.

There have been several operas based on Tubman's life, including <a href="Thea%20Musgrave">Thea Musgrave</a>'s "<a href="Harriet%2C%20the%20Woman%20Called%20Moses">Harriet, the Woman Called Moses</a>" which premiered in 1985.

A <a href="biopic">biographical film</a> based on Tubman's life is in production. The film, "<a href="Harriet%20%282017%20film%29">Harriet</a>", stars <a href="Cynthia%20Erivo">Cynthia Erivo</a> in the title role.

A section of the <a href="Wyman%20Park%2C%20Baltimore">Wyman Park Dell</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> was renamed Harriet Tubman Grove in March 2018; the grove was previously the site of two statues of Confederate generals <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>, both of which were among four statues <a href="removal%20of%20Confederate%20monuments%20and%20memorials">removed</a> from the park by the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Council">Baltimore City Council</a> in August 2017.

The first modern biography of Tubman to be published after Sarah Hopkins Bradford's 1869 and 1886 books was <a href="Earl%20Conrad">Earl Conrad</a>'s "Harriet Tubman" (retitled "Harriet Tubman: Negro Soldier and Abolitionist" in some later printings). Conrad had experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher – the search took four years – and endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style to document the historical importance of her work for scholars and the nation's memory. The book was finally published by <a href="Carter%20G.%20Woodson">Carter G. Woodson</a>'s Associated Publishers in 1943. Despite her popularity and significance, another Tubman biography for adults did not appear for 60 years, until Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman's life stories in 2003, and <a href="Kate%20Larson">Larson</a> and <a href="Catherine%20Clinton">Clinton</a> both published their biographies in 2004. Author Milton C. Sernett discusses all the major biographies of Tubman in his 2007 book "Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History".

In southern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, the <a href="British%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20Salem%20Chapel">Salem Chapel BME Church</a> was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Site</a> in 1999, on the recommendation of the <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada%23Historic%20Sites%20and%20Monuments%20Board%20of%20Canada">Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada</a>. The chapel, in <a href="St.%20Catharines">St. Catharines</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, was a focus of Harriet Tubman's years in the city, when she lived nearby, in what was a major terminus of the Underground Railroad and center of abolitionist work. In Tubman's time, the chapel was known as Bethel Chapel, and was initially part of the <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church</a>, prior to a change in 1856.

Tubman, herself, was designated a <a href="Persons%20of%20National%20Historic%20Significance">National Historic Person</a> after the Historic Sites and Monuments Board recommended it, in 2005. Several historical markers—two federal, one provincial, and one civic—surround the active chapel, as well as a bust of Tubman.

As early as 2008, <a href="advocacy%20group">advocacy group</a>s in Maryland and New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her place of birth on <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Maryland">Maryland's eastern shore</a>, and sites along the route of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> in <a href="Caroline%20County%2C%20Maryland">Caroline</a>, <a href="Dorchester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Dorchester</a>, and <a href="Talbot%20County%2C%20Maryland">Talbot</a> Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in <a href="Auburn%2C%20NY">Auburn, NY</a>. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Obama</a> used his executive authority to create the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Underground%20Railroad%20National%20Monument">Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument</a>, consisting of federal lands on <a href="Maryland%27s%20Eastern%20Shore">Maryland's Eastern Shore</a> at <a href="Blackwater%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

In December 2014, authorization for a national historical park designation was incorporated in the <a href="Howard%20P.%20%26quot%3BBuck%26quot%3B%20McKeon%20National%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act%20for%20Fiscal%20Year%202015">2015 National Defense Authorization Act</a>. Despite opposition from some legislators, the bill passed with bipartisan support, and was signed into law by the President on December 19, 2014.
In March 2017 the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Underground%20Railroad%20Visitor%20Center">Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center</a> was inaugurated in Maryland within <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Underground%20Railroad%20State%20Park">Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park</a>.

As enacted, the legislation authorized establishment of the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20National%20Historical%20Park">Harriet Tubman National Historical Park</a> in Cayuga County, New York, pending the acquisition of lands, and created the <a href="Harriet%20Tubman%20Underground%20Railroad%20National%20Historical%20Park">Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park</a> in Maryland. The latter was created from within the authorized boundary of the national monument, while permitting later additional acquisitions. The park in Auburn, New York, was established on January 10, 2017.

The Harriet Tubman House in Boston's South End is a site on the <a href="Boston%20Women%27s%20Heritage%20Trail">Boston Women's Heritage Trail</a>.

On April 20, 2016, then-<a href="U.S.%20Treasury%20Secretary">U.S. Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Lew">Jack Lew</a> announced plans to add Tubman to the front of the <a href="United%20States%20twenty-dollar%20bill">twenty-dollar bill</a>, moving President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> to the rear of the bill. Lew instructed the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Engraving%20and%20Printing">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a> to expedite the redesign process, and the new bill was expected to enter circulation sometime after 2020; however, <a href="Steven%20Mnuchin">Steven Mnuchin</a>, the current U.S. Treasury Secretary, said that he will not commit to putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill, explaining "People have been on the bills for a long period of time. This is something we'll consider; right now we have a lot more important issues to focus on."

John Knox

John Knox ( – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish <a href="Ministers%20and%20elders%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">minister</a>, <a href="Christian%20theology">theologian</a>, and writer who was a leader of <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">the country's Reformation</a>. He was the founder of the <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. 

Born in <a href="Giffordgate">Giffordgate</a>, Knox is believed to have been educated at the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as <a href="George%20Wishart">George Wishart</a>, he joined the movement to reform the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20Scotland">Scottish church</a>. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal <a href="David%20Beaton">David Beaton</a> in 1546 and the intervention of the <a href="regent">regent</a> of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Mary of Guise</a>, a French noblewoman. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.

While in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, where he rose in the ranks to serve <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">King Edward VI of England</a> as a royal chaplain. He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>". In England, he met and married his first wife, Margery Bowes. When <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary Tudor</a> ascended the throne of England and re-established <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country. Knox moved to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and then to <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>. In Geneva, he met <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, from whom he gained experience and knowledge of <a href="Reformed%20theology">Reformed theology</a> and <a href="Presbyterian%20polity">Presbyterian polity</a>. He created a new order of service, which was eventually adopted by the reformed church in Scotland. He left Geneva to head the <a href="Marian%20exiles">English refugee</a> church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the <a href="Christian%20liturgy">liturgy</a>, thus ending his association with the Church of England.

On his return to Scotland, Knox led the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> <a href="Scottish%20nobility">nobility</a>. The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. Knox helped write the new <a href="Scots%20Confession">confession of faith</a> and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">the Kirk</a>. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. When she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Lord%20Darnley">Lord Darnley</a> and <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James VI</a> was enthroned in her stead, Knox openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.

John Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near <a href="Haddington%2C%20East%20Lothian">Haddington</a>, the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="East%20Lothian">East Lothian</a>. His father, William Knox, was a merchant. All that is known of his mother is that her maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child. Their eldest son, William, carried on his father's business, which helped in Knox's international communications.

Knox was probably educated at the <a href="Knox%20Academy">grammar school in Haddington</a>. In this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural. He proceeded to further studies at the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> or possibly at the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>. He studied under <a href="John%20Major%20%28philosopher%29">John Major</a>, one of the greatest scholars of the time. Knox was ordained a catholic priest in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on Easter Eve of 1536 by <a href="William%20Chisholm%20%28II%29">William Chisholm</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</a>. 

Knox first appears in public records as a priest and a <a href="Notary%20public">notary</a> in 1540. He was still serving in these capacities as late as 1543 when he described himself as a "minister of the sacred altar in the diocese of St. Andrews, notary by apostolic authority" in a notarial deed dated 27 March. Rather than taking up parochial duties in a parish, he became <a href="tutor">tutor</a> to two sons of Hugh Douglas of <a href="Longniddry">Longniddry</a>. He also taught the son of <a href="John%20Cockburn%20of%20Ormiston">John Cockburn</a> of <a href="Ormiston">Ormiston</a>. Both of these <a href="laird">laird</a>s had embraced the new religious ideas of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>.

Knox did not record when or how he was converted to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were <a href="Patrick%20Hamilton%20%28martyr%29">Patrick Hamilton</a> and <a href="George%20Wishart">George Wishart</a>. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> he preached against the <a href="Marian%20devotions">veneration</a> of the <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Virgin Mary</a>. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in <a href="effigy">effigy</a> at the <a href="St%20Nicholas%2C%20Bristol">Church of St Nicholas</a> as a sign of his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continent</a>, he translated the <a href="First%20Helvetic%20Confession">First Helvetic Confession</a> into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, <a href="James%20Hamilton%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ch%C3%A2tellerault">James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault</a>, the appointed regent for the infant <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, had decided with the Queen Mother, <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Mary of Guise</a>, and <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a> <a href="David%20Beaton">David Beaton</a> to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the reformation and when he arrived in <a href="East%20Lothian">East Lothian</a>, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the <a href="Patrick%20Hepburn%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Bothwell">Earl of Bothwell</a> and taken to the <a href="St%20Andrews%20Castle">Castle of St Andrews</a>. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, "Nay, return to your <a href="bairn">bairn</a>s [children] and God bless you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice." Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, <a href="Archdeacon">Archdeacon</a> <a href="John%20Lauder">John Lauder</a>. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.

Knox had avoided being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice to return to tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later he was still in charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He toyed with the idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox remained a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was <a href="Henry%20Balnaves">Henry Balnaves</a>, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine, and Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.

Knox's powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the <a href="St%20Andrews%23Parish%20Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Trinity">parish church</a> on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, <a href="John%20Major%20%28philosopher%29">John Major</a>. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a>, comparing the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> with the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> as his sole authority and the doctrine of <a href="Sola%20fide">justification by faith alone</a>, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>, and prayers for the dead.

John Knox's chaplaincy of the castle garrison was not to last long. While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided that it could be taken only by force and requested the king of France, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II</a> to intervene. On 29 June 1547, 21 French <a href="galley">galley</a>s approached St Andrews under the command of <a href="Leone%20Strozzi">Leone Strozzi</a>, <a href="prior">prior</a> of <a href="Capua">Capua</a>. The French <a href="Siege%20of%20St%20Andrews%20Castle">besieged the castle</a> and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July. The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys. The <a href="galley%20slaves">galley slaves</a> were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand. They sailed to France and navigated up the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> to <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. The nobles, some of whom would have an impact later in Knox's life such as <a href="William%20Kirkcaldy">William Kirkcaldy</a> and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France. Knox and the other galley slaves continued to <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> and stayed on the <a href="Loire%20River">Loire</a> throughout the winter. They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship. Knox recounted an incident in which one Scot—possibly himself, as he tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person—was required to show devotion to a picture of the Virgin Mary. The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of <a href="veneration">veneration</a>. He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, "Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim." After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions.

In summer 1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. <a href="James%20Balfour%20%28Pittendreich%29">James Balfour</a>, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.

In February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released. It is uncertain how he obtained his liberty. Later in the year, Henry II arranged with <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI of England</a> the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners.

On his release, Knox took refuge in England. The <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation in England</a> was a less radical movement than its Continental counterparts, but there was a definite breach with Rome. The <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, and the regent of <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">King Edward VI</a>, the <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>, were decidedly Protestant-minded. However, much work remained to bring reformed ideas to the clergy and to the people. On 7 April 1549, Knox was licensed to work in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. His first commission was in <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>. He was obliged to use the recently released "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", which maintained the structure of the <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a> while adapting the content to the doctrine of the reformed Church of England. Knox, however, modified its use to accord with the doctrinal emphases of the Continental reformers. In the pulpit he preached Protestant doctrines with great effect as his congregation grew.
In England, Knox met his wife, Margery Bowes (died ). Her father, Richard Bowes (died 1558), was a descendant of an old <a href="County%20Durham">Durham</a> family and her mother, Elizabeth Aske, was an heiress of a <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> family, the Askes of <a href="Richmondshire">Richmondshire</a>. <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowes">Elizabeth Bowes</a> presumably met Knox when he was employed in Berwick. Several letters reveal a close friendship between them. It is not recorded when Knox married Margery Bowes. Knox attempted to obtain the consent of the Bowes family, but her father and her brother <a href="Robert%20Bowes%20%28diplomat%29">Robert Bowes</a> were opposed to the marriage.

Towards the end of 1550, Knox was appointed a preacher of <a href="Newcastle%20Cathedral">St Nicholas' Church</a> in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. The following year he was appointed one of the six <a href="Chapel%20Royal">royal chaplains</a> serving the King. On 16 October 1551, <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland</a>, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the "coup d'état" in a sermon on <a href="All%20Saints%20Day">All Saints Day</a>. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the fire-brand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the second edition of the "Book of Common Prayer". The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during <a href="Eucharist">communion</a>. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The end result was a compromise in which the famous <a href="Black%20Rubric">Black Rubric</a>, which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.

Soon afterwards, Dudley, who saw Knox as a useful political tool, offered him the <a href="Diocese">bishopric</a> of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a>. Knox refused, and he returned to Newcastle. On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint Knox as vicar of <a href="All%20Hallows%2C%20Bread%20Street">All Hallows, Bread Street</a> in London, placing him under the authority of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Ridley%20%28martyr%29">Nicholas Ridley</a>. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the King and the Court during Lent and he again refused to take the assigned post. Knox was then told to preach in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> and he remained there until Edward's death on 6 July. Edward's successor, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary Tudor</a>, re-established Roman Catholicism in England and restored the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> in all the churches. With the country no longer safe for Protestant preachers, Knox left for the Continent in January 1554 on the advice of friends. On the eve of his flight, he wrote:

Sometime I have thought that impossible it had been, so to have removed my affection from the realm of Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.

Knox disembarked in <a href="Dieppe%2C%20Seine-Maritime">Dieppe</a>, France, and continued to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> had established his authority. When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position. He had recently prosecuted the execution of the scholar <a href="Michael%20Servetus">Michael Servetus</a> for heresy. Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler. Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer <a href="Heinrich%20Bullinger">Heinrich Bullinger</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Bullinger's responses were equally cautious; but Knox had already made up his mind. On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne. He also attacked the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>, calling him "no less enemy to Christ than was Nero".

In a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of <a href="Marian%20exiles">English exiles</a> in <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> to become one of their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the "Book of Common Prayer". More recently arrived refugees, however, including <a href="Edmund%20Grindal">Edmund Grindal</a>, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, <a href="William%20Whittingham">William Whittingham</a>, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included <a href="Richard%20Cox%20%28bishop%29">Richard Cox</a>, one of the principal authors of the "Book of Common Prayer". Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.

After his return to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the minister at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking him to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts about the state of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Earl of Moray</a> and the <a href="John%20Erskine%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mar%20%28d.%201572%29">Earl of Mar</a>.

Though the Queen Regent, <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Mary of Guise</a>, made no move against Knox, his activities caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him as a threat to their authority and summoned him to appear in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the <a href="Earl%20Marischal">Earl Marischal</a>, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.

Shortly after Knox sent the letter to the Queen Regent, he suddenly announced that he felt his duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.

For the next two years, he lived a happy life in Geneva. He recommended Geneva to his friends in England as the best place of asylum for Protestants. In one letter he wrote:

I neither fear nor eschame to say, is the most perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth since the days of the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and religion so sincerely reformed, I have not yet seen in any other place ...

Knox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours. The services used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's "Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques". The church in which he preached, the "Église de Notre Dame la Neuve"—now known as the <a href="Auditoire%20de%20Calvin">Auditoire de Calvin</a>—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, for the use of the English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and <a href="Myles%20Coverdale">Myles Coverdale</a> their respective godfathers.

In the summer of 1558, Knox published his best known pamphlet, "<a href="The%20first%20blast%20of%20the%20trumpet%20against%20the%20monstruous%20regiment%20of%20women">The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women</a>". In calling the "regimen" or rule of women "monstruous", he meant that it was "unnatural". Knox states that his purpose was to demonstrate "how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard". The women rulers that Knox had in mind were <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary I of England</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Mary of Guise</a>, the <a href="Dowager%20Queen">Dowager Queen</a> of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. This biblical position was not unusual in Knox’s day; however, even he was aware that the pamphlet was dangerously seditious. He therefore published it anonymously and did not tell Calvin, who denied knowledge of it until a year after its publication, that he had written it. In England, the pamphlet was officially condemned by royal proclamation. The impact of the document was complicated later that year, when <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth Tudor</a> became Queen of England. Although Knox had not targeted Elizabeth, he had deeply offended her, and she never forgave him.

With a Protestant on the throne, the English refugees in Geneva prepared to return home. Knox himself decided to return to Scotland. Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva. Knox left in January 1559, but he did not arrive in Scotland until 2 May 1559, owing to Elizabeth's refusal to issue him a passport through England.

Two days after Knox arrived in Edinburgh, he proceeded to <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a> where a large number of Protestant sympathisers had gathered. Knox was declared an outlaw, and the <a href="Mary%20of%20Guise">Queen Regent</a> summoned the Protestants to <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>. Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot. A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted. The mob then attacked two friaries in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army. She dispatched the <a href="Archibald%20Campbell%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Argyll">Earl of Argyll</a> and <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Lord Moray</a> to offer terms and avert a war. She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town. The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French pay roll. This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>. Knox's return to St Andrews fulfilled the prophecy he made in the galleys that he would one day preach again in its church. When he did give a sermon, the effect was the same as in Perth. The people engaged in vandalism and looting.

With Protestant reinforcements arriving from neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to <a href="Dunbar">Dunbar</a>. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops were on the verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant <a href="Lords%20of%20the%20Congregation">Lords of the Congregation</a> occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of <a href="St%20Giles%27%20Cathedral">St Giles'</a>, the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the <a href="Articles%20of%20Leith">Articles of Leith</a> signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.

Knox knew that the Queen Regent would ask for help from France. So he negotiated by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil</a>, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, off the northeast coast of England at the end of July, to meet <a href="James%20Croft">James Croft</a> and Sir Henry Percy at <a href="Berwick%20upon%20Tweed">Berwick upon Tweed</a>. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that <a href="Henry%20Balnaves">Henry Balnaves</a> should go to Cecil.

When additional French troops arrived in <a href="Leith">Leith</a>, Edinburgh's seaport, the Protestants responded by retaking Edinburgh. This time, on 24 October 1559, the Scottish nobility formally deposed Mary of Guise from the regency. Her secretary, <a href="William%20Maitland%20of%20Lethington">William Maitland of Lethington</a>, defected to the Protestant side, bringing his administrative skills. From then on, Maitland took over the political tasks, freeing Knox for the role of religious leader. For the final stage of the revolution, Maitland appealed to Scottish patriotism to fight French domination. Following the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berwick%20%281560%29">Treaty of Berwick</a>, support from England finally arrived and by the end of March, a significant English army joined the Scottish Protestant forces. The sudden death of Mary of Guise in <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a> on 10 June 1560 paved the way for an end to hostilities, the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Edinburgh">Treaty of Edinburgh</a>, and the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland. On 19 July, Knox held a National Thanksgiving Service at St Giles'.

On 1 August, the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> met to settle religious issues. Knox and five other ministers were called upon to draw up a new <a href="confession%20of%20faith">confession of faith</a>. Within four days, the <a href="Scots%20Confession">Scots Confession</a> was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or <a href="the%20Kirk">the Kirk</a>. They would work for several months on the "<a href="Book%20of%20Discipline%20%28Church%20of%20Scotland%29">Book of Discipline</a>", the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.

Parliament reconvened on 15 January 1561 to consider the "Book of Discipline". The Kirk was to be run on democratic lines. Each congregation was free to choose or reject its own pastor, but once he was chosen he could not be fired. Each parish was to be self-supporting, as far as possible. The bishops were replaced by ten to twelve "superintendents". The plan included a system of national education based on <a href="Universal%20education%23Scottish%20education">universality</a> as a fundamental principle. Certain areas of law were placed under ecclesiastical authority. The Parliament did not approve the plan, however, mainly for reasons of finance. The Kirk was to be financed out of the patrimony of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. Much of this was now in the hands of the nobles, who were reluctant to give up their possessions. A final decision on the plan was delayed because of the impending return of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>.

On 19 August 1561, cannon were fired in Leith to announce Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being celebrated in the royal chapel at <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood Palace</a> five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation that there would be no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> had been willing to live under <a href="Nero">Nero</a>'s rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.

On 13 December 1562, Mary sent for Knox again after he gave a sermon denouncing certain celebrations which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing at the expense of the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.

During Easter in 1563, some priests in <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a> celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried to enforce the law themselves by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.

The most dramatic interview between Mary and Knox took place on 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing that he had been preaching against her proposed marriage to <a href="Carlos%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias">Don Carlos</a>, the son of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>. Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. "What have ye to do with my marriage?" she asked, and "What are ye within this commonwealth?" "A subject born within the same, Madam," Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, "Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping." He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and "betray my Commonwealth". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.

Knox's final encounter with Mary was prompted by an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer <a href="royal%20progress">progress</a> in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, <a href="Burgess%20%28title%29">burgess</a>es of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if this was not a treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Scotland">Privy Council</a>. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.

On 26 March 1564 Knox stirred controversy again, when he married <a href="Margaret%20Knox">Margaret Stewart</a>, the daughter of an old friend, <a href="Andrew%20Stewart%2C%202nd%20Lord%20Ochiltree">Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree</a>, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.

When the General Assembly convened in June 1564, an argument broke out between Knox and Maitland over the authority of the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a> was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the <a href="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.

On 29 July 1565 when Mary married <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Lord%20Darnley">Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley</a>, some of the Protestant nobles, including <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray</a>, rose up in rebellion. Knox revealed his own objection while preaching in the presence of the new <a href="King%20Consort">King Consort</a> on 19 August 1565. He made passing allusions on ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out. Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh.
On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, <a href="David%20Rizzio">David Rizzio</a>, was murdered by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March returned with a formidable force. Knox fled to <a href="Kyle%2C%20Ayrshire">Kyle</a> in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his "<a href="magnum%20opus">magnum opus</a>", "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Reformation%20in%20Scotland">History of the Reformation in Scotland</a>". When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided over what to do with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the <a href="James%20Hepburn%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Bothwell">Earl of Bothwell</a>. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she had been <a href="Act%20Anent%20the%20demission%20of%20the%20Crown%20in%20favour%20of%20our%20Sovereign%20Lord%2C%20and%20his%20Majesty%27s%20Coronation%201567">forced to abdicate</a> and was imprisoned in <a href="Loch%20Leven%20Castle">Loch Leven Castle</a>. <a href="James%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Moray">Lord Moray</a> had become the regent of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James VI</a>. Other old friends of Knox's, <a href="Archibald%20Campbell%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Argyll">Lord Argyll</a> and <a href="William%20Kirkcaldy%20of%20Grange">William Kirkcaldy</a>, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, even to the point of calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.

The fighting in Scotland continued as a <a href="marian%20civil%20war">civil war</a>. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the <a href="Matthew%20Stewart%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Lennox">Earl of Lennox</a>, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, <a href="Kirkcaldy%20of%20Grange">Kirkcaldy of Grange</a>, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his "History". At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.

After inducting his successor, Lawson of <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, as minister of St Giles' on 9 November, Knox returned to his home for the last time. With his friends and some of the greatest Scottish nobles around him, he asked for the Bible to be read aloud. On his last day, 24 November 1572, his young wife read from <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians">Paul's first letter to the Corinthians</a>. A testimony to Knox was pronounced at his grave in the churchyard of St Giles' by <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Morton">James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton</a> and newly elected regent of Scotland: "Here lies one who never feared any flesh". After the churchyard's destruction in 1633 the precise site of Knox's grave cannot be established.

In his will, Knox claimed: "None have I corrupted, none have I defrauded; merchandise have I not made." The paltry sum of money Knox bequeathed to his family, which would have left them in dire poverty, showed that he had not profited from his work in the Kirk. The regent, Lord Morton, asked the General Assembly to continue paying his <a href="stipend">stipend</a> to his widow for one year after his death, and the regent ensured that Knox's dependents were decently supported.

Knox was survived by his five children and his second wife. Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>. Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John's but died early in 1580. Eleazar was ordained into the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> and served in the parish of <a href="Great%20Clacton">Clacton Magna</a>. He also died young, and was buried in the chapel of <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College</a> in 1591. Knox's second wife, Margaret Stewart, got remarried to Andrew Ker, one of those involved in the murder of David Rizzio. Knox's three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of <a href="Robert%20Pont%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">Robert Pont</a> and brother of <a href="Timothy%20Pont">Timothy Pont</a>; and Elizabeth to <a href="John%20Welsh%20of%20Ayr">John Welsh</a>, a minister of the Kirk.

Knox's death was barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was attended by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their surviving letters. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a successful reformer and it was this philosophy of reformation that had a great impact on the English <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a>. He has also been described as having contributed to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.

Knox was notable not so much for the overthrow of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a> rather than <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant <a href="Archbishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">Archbishop of St Andrews</a> <a href="John%20Douglas%20%28archbishop%20of%20St%20Andrews%29">John Douglas</a> in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide. 

A bust of Knox is in the Hall of Heroes of the <a href="National%20Wallace%20Monument">National Wallace Monument</a> in <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>.

Josiah Willard Gibbs

Josiah Willard Gibbs (February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903) was an American scientist who made important theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> was instrumental in transforming <a href="physical%20chemistry">physical chemistry</a> into a rigorous inductive science. Together with <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>, he created <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> (a term that he coined), explaining the <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a> as consequences of the statistical properties of <a href="Statistical%20ensemble%20%28mathematical%20physics%29">ensembles</a> of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a> to problems in <a href="physical%20optics">physical optics</a>. As a mathematician, he invented modern <a href="vector%20calculus">vector calculus</a> (independently of the British scientist <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a>, who carried out similar work during the same period).

In 1863, <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> awarded Gibbs the first American <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">doctorate</a> in <a href="engineering">engineering</a>. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was professor of <a href="mathematical%20physics">mathematical physics</a> from 1871 until his death. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> as "the greatest mind in American history". In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> of London, "for his contributions to mathematical physics".

Commentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and the great international impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to <a href="Robert%20Andrews%20Millikan">Robert A. Millikan</a>, in pure science, Gibbs "did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Laplace</a> did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure".

Gibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He belonged to an old <a href="Yankee">Yankee</a> family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of <a href="Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs%2C%20Sr.">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a> Sr., and his wife Mary Anna, "née" Van Cleve. On his father's side, he was descended from <a href="Samuel%20Willard">Samuel Willard</a>, who served as acting <a href="President%20of%20Harvard%20University">President of Harvard College</a> from 1701 to 1707. On his mother's side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. <a href="Jonathan%20Dickinson%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Jonathan Dickinson</a>, the first president of the College of New Jersey (later <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>). Gibbs's given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> in the 18th century.

The elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as "Josiah", while the son was called "Willard". Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at <a href="Yale%20Divinity%20School">Yale Divinity School</a> from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship "<a href="La%20Amistad">Amistad</a>", allowing them to testify during <a href="United%20States%20v.%20The%20Amistad">the trial</a> that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves.

Willard Gibbs was educated at the <a href="Hopkins%20School">Hopkins School</a> and entered <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a> in 1854 at the age of 15. At Yale, Gibbs received prizes for excellence in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, and he graduated in 1858, near the top of his class. He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the <a href="Sheffield%20Scientific%20School">Sheffield Scientific School</a>. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the <a href="Connecticut%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.

Relatively few documents from the period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision. In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician <a href="Hubert%20Anson%20Newton">Hubert Anson Newton</a>, a leading authority on <a href="Meteoroid">meteors</a>, who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant. After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.

Recurrent <a href="Lung">pulmonary</a> trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, which had killed his mother. He also suffered from <a href="Astigmatism%20%28eye%29">astigmatism</a>, whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to <a href="Ophthalmology">oculists</a>, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses. Though in later years he used <a href="glasses">glasses</a> only for reading or other close work, Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> of 1861–65. He was not <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Civil%20War">conscripted</a> and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.

In 1863, Gibbs received the first <a href="Doctorate%20of%20Philosophy">Doctorate of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled "On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing", in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for <a href="gear">gear</a>s. In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a Ph.D. degree and Gibbs's was only the fifth Ph.D. granted in the US in any subject.

After graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the College for a term of three years. During the first two years, he taught Latin and during the third year, he taught "natural philosophy" (i.e., physics). In 1866, he patented a design for a <a href="railway%20brake">railway brake</a> and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled "The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length", in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.

After his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866–67 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a> and the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>, given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as <a href="Joseph%20Liouville">Joseph Liouville</a> and <a href="Michel%20Chasles">Michel Chasles</a>. Having undertaken a punishing regime of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the <a href="French%20Riviera">Riviera</a>, where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.

Moving to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians <a href="Karl%20Weierstrass">Karl Weierstrass</a> and <a href="Leopold%20Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a>, as well as by chemist <a href="Heinrich%20Gustav%20Magnus">Heinrich Gustav Magnus</a>. In August 1867, Gibbs's sister Julia was married in Berlin to <a href="Addison%20Van%20Name">Addison Van Name</a>, who had been Gibbs's classmate at Yale. The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany. In <a href="Heidelberg%20University">Heidelberg</a>, Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> and <a href="Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>, and chemist <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a>. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>.

Gibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students. It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine <a href="Governor%20%28device%29">governor</a>, his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering. In 1871, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.

Gibbs published his first work in 1873. His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the "Transactions of the Connecticut Academy". These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, such as the ones that <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">Maxwell</a> used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> at <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a <a href="Maxwell%27s%20thermodynamic%20surface">clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct</a>. He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.

Maxwell included a chapter on Gibbs's work in the next edition of his "Theory of Heat", published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs's graphical methods in a lecture to the <a href="Chemical%20Society">Chemical Society</a> of London and even referred to it in the article on "Diagrams" that he wrote for the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>". Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that "only one man lived who could understand Gibbs's papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead."

Gibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one form of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications. He described that research in a monograph titled "<a href="On%20the%20Equilibrium%20of%20Heterogeneous%20Substances">On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances</a>", published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations, begins with a quotation from <a href="Rudolf%20Clausius">Rudolf Clausius</a> that expresses what would later be called the first and second <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>: "The <a href="energy">energy</a> of the world is constant. The <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of the world tends towards a maximum."

Gibbs's monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations. The work has been described as "the "<a href="Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Principia</a>" of thermodynamics" and as a work of "practically unlimited scope". It solidly laid the foundation for physical Chemistry. <a href="Wilhelm%20Ostwald">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>, who translated Gibbs's monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the "founder of chemical energetics". According to modern commentators,

Gibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.

From 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the <a href="exterior%20algebra">exterior algebra</a> of <a href="Hermann%20Grassmann">Hermann Grassmann</a> into a <a href="vector%20calculus">vector calculus</a> well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the <a href="Dot%20product">dot</a> and <a href="cross%20product">cross product</a>s of two vectors and introduced the concept of <a href="dyadics">dyadics</a>. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a>. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the <a href="quaternion">quaternion</a>ic calculus of <a href="William%20Rowan%20Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a>, which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with <a href="Peter%20Guthrie%20Tait">Peter Guthrie Tait</a> and others in the pages of "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>".

Gibbs's lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by <a href="Edwin%20Bidwell%20Wilson">Edwin Bidwell Wilson</a> into a textbook, "<a href="Vector%20Analysis">Vector Analysis</a>", published in 1901. That book helped to popularize the "<a href="del">del</a>" notation that is widely used today in <a href="Classical%20electromagnetism">electrodynamics</a> and <a href="fluid%20mechanics">fluid mechanics</a>. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the "<a href="Gibbs%20phenomenon">Gibbs phenomenon</a>" in the theory of <a href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a> (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, <a href="Henry%20Wilbraham">Henry Wilbraham</a>).

From 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on <a href="physical%20optics">physical optics</a>, in which he investigated <a href="birefringence">birefringence</a> and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of <a href="William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> and others. In his work on optics, just as much as in his work on thermodynamics, Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts.The methods that he used were highly original and the obtained results showed decisively the correctness of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.

Gibbs coined the term "statistical mechanics" and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of <a href="chemical%20potential">chemical potential</a> (1876), and <a href="Statistical%20ensemble%20%28mathematical%20physics%29">statistical ensemble</a> (1902). Gibbs's derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook "Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics", published in 1902, a year before his death.

Gibbs's retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that "except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home—a little exercise between work and dinner—and one might occasionally come across him at that time." Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by <a href="Irving%20Fisher">Irving Fisher</a> in 1891. After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his "Collected Works". Another distinguished student was <a href="Lee%20De%20Forest">Lee De Forest</a>, later a pioneer of radio technology.

Gibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, the victim of an acute intestinal obstruction. A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121 High Street, and his body was buried in the nearby <a href="Grove%20Street%20Cemetery">Grove Street Cemetery</a>. In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory. The eminent British physicist <a href="J.%20J.%20Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a> was in attendance and delivered a brief address.

Gibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack</a>s (at <a href="Keene%20Valley%2C%20New%20York">Keene Valley, New York</a>) and later at the <a href="White%20Mountains%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">White Mountains</a> (in <a href="Intervale%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Intervale, New Hampshire</a>), his sojourn in Europe in 1866–69 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven. He joined Yale's College Church (a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational church</a>) at the end of his freshman year and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life. Gibbs generally voted for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate in presidential elections but, like other "<a href="Mugwump">Mugwump</a>s", his concern over the growing corruption associated with <a href="Political%20machine">machine politics</a> led him to support <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, a conservative <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>, in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">election of 1884</a>. Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.

Gibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed. Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for <a href="Rudolf%20Clausius">Rudolf Clausius</a>, one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H. A. Newton. In Edward Bidwell Wilson's view,

According to <a href="Lynde%20Wheeler">Lynde Wheeler</a>, who had been Gibbs's student at Yale, in his later years Gibbs

He was a careful investor and financial manager, and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at $100,000 (roughly $ today). For many years, he served as trustee, secretary, and treasurer of his alma mater, the Hopkins School. US President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> appointed him as one of the commissioners to the National Conference of Electricians, which convened in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in September 1884, and Gibbs presided over one of its sessions. A keen and skilled horseman, Gibbs was seen habitually in New Haven driving his sister's <a href="carriage">carriage</a>. In an obituary published in the "<a href="American%20Journal%20of%20Science">American Journal of Science</a>", Gibbs's former student <a href="Henry%20Andrews%20Bumstead">Henry A. Bumstead</a> referred to Gibbs's personal character:

Gibbs's papers from the 1870s introduced the idea of expressing the internal energy "U" of a system in terms of the <a href="entropy">entropy</a> "S", in addition to the usual <a href="state%20variable">state-variable</a>s of volume "V", pressure "p", and temperature "T". He also introduced the concept of the <a href="chemical%20potential">chemical potential</a> formula_1 of a given chemical species, defined to be the rate of the increase in "U" associated with the increase in the number "N" of molecules of that species (at constant entropy and volume). Thus, it was Gibbs who first combined the first and second <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a> by expressing the infinitesimal change in the internal energy, d"U", of a <a href="closed%20system">closed system</a> in the form:

formula_2

where "T" is the <a href="absolute%20temperature">absolute temperature</a>, "p" is the pressure, d"S" is an infinitesimal change in entropy and d"V" is an infinitesimal change of volume. The last term is the sum, over all the chemical species in a chemical reaction, of the chemical potential, "μ", of the "i" species, multiplied by the infinitesimal change in the number of moles, d"N" of that species. By taking the <a href="Legendre%20transformation">Legendre transform</a> of this expression, he defined the concepts of <a href="enthalpy">enthalpy</a>, "H" and <a href="Gibbs%20free%20energy">Gibbs free energy</a>, "G".
This compares to the expression for <a href="Helmholtz%20free%20energy">Helmholtz free energy</a>, "A".

When the Gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative the reaction will proceed spontaneously. When a chemical system is at <a href="equilibrium%20chemistry">equilibrium</a>, the change in Gibbs free energy is zero. An <a href="equilibrium%20constant">equilibrium constant</a> is simply related to the free energy change when the reactants are in their <a href="standard%20state">standard state</a>s.
<a href="Chemical%20potential">Chemical potential</a> is usually defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy.

Gibbs also obtained what later came to be known as the "<a href="Gibbs%E2%80%93Duhem%20equation">Gibbs–Duhem equation</a>".

The publication of the paper "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" (1874–78) is now regarded as a landmark in the development of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. In it, Gibbs developed a rigorous mathematical theory for various <a href="transport%20phenomena">transport phenomena</a>, including <a href="adsorption">adsorption</a>, <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>, and the <a href="Marangoni%20effect">Marangoni effect</a> in fluid mixtures. He also formulated the <a href="phase%20rule">phase rule</a>

formula_7

for the number "F" of <a href="Intensive%20and%20extensive%20properties">variables</a> that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of "C" components existing in "P" <a href="Phase%20%28matter%29">phases</a>. Phase rule is very useful in diverse areas, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, and petrology. It can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry.

Together with James Clerk Maxwell and <a href="Ludwig%20Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>, Gibbs founded "statistical mechanics", a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of <a href="Statistical%20ensemble%20%28mathematical%20physics%29">ensembles</a>, a collection of many possible states of a system, each assigned a certain probability. He introduced the concept of "<a href="phase%20space">phase of a mechanical system</a>". He used the concept to define the <a href="microcanonical%20ensemble">microcanonical</a>, <a href="canonical%20ensemble">canonical</a>, and <a href="grand%20canonical%20ensemble">grand canonical ensemble</a>s; all related to the <a href="Gibbs%20measure">Gibbs measure</a>, thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.

According to <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>, writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the <a href="Irreversible%20process">irreversibility</a> of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, "the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his "Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics"." Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's <a href="H-theorem">H-theorem</a> and of the <a href="ergodic%20hypothesis">ergodic hypothesis</a>, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.

Gibbs was well aware that the application of the <a href="equipartition%20theorem">equipartition theorem</a> to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the <a href="Heat%20capacity">specific heats</a> of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on "hypotheses about the constitution of matter". Gibbs's own framework for statistical mechanics, based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable <a href="Microstate%20%28statistical%20mechanics%29">microstates</a>, could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries. His resolution of the so-called "<a href="Gibbs%20paradox">Gibbs paradox</a>", about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the <a href="Identical%20particles">indistinguishability of particles</a> required by quantum physics.

British scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton's <a href="quaternion">quaternion</a>s in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Gibbs, however, noted that the product of quaternions always had to be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a>, so that the use of quaternions introduced mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. He proposed defining distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. He was also largely responsible for the development of the <a href="vector%20calculus">vector calculus</a> techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.

While he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his "multiple algebra". Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. To establish priority of Grassmann's ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay "Theorie der Ebbe und Flut" on <a href="tide">tide</a>s that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the <a href="University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a>, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> (<a href="linear%20space">linear space</a>).

As Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a>. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s. He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in <a href="crystallography">crystallography</a>.

Though Gibbs's research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> by applying <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a> to the theory of optical processes such as <a href="birefringence">birefringence</a>, <a href="Dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>, and <a href="Optical%20rotation">optical activity</a>. In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called <a href="Luminiferous%20aether">luminiferous ether</a>). Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a <a href="longitudinal%20wave">longitudinal</a> electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of <a href="light">light</a>, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their "<a href="Gauge%20fixing">gauge invariance</a>"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an "ad hoc" condition on the properties of the aether.

In his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that

Shortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of <a href="Heinrich%20Hertz">Heinrich Hertz</a> in Germany.

Gibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues, and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible. His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the "Transactions of the Connecticut Academy", a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the USA and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the Academy, both <a href="Elias%20Loomis">Elias Loomis</a> and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs's work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.

Even though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs's graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics only came into widespread use in the mid 20th century, with the work of <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Tisza">László Tisza</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Callen">Herbert Callen</a>. According to James Gerald Crowther,

On the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> in 1879 and received the 1880 <a href="Rumford%20Prize">Rumford Prize</a> from the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> for his work on chemical thermodynamics. He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a>.

In Europe, Gibbs was inducted as honorary member of the <a href="London%20Mathematical%20Society">London Mathematical Society</a> in 1892 and elected <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201897">Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1897</a>. He was elected as corresponding member of the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Prussian</a> and <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French</a> Academies of Science and received honorary doctorates from the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Erlangen-Nuremberg">Erlangen</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">Christiania</a> (now Oslo). The Royal Society further honored Gibbs in 1901 with the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a>, then regarded as the highest international award in the natural sciences, noting that he had been "the first to apply the second law of thermodynamics to the exhaustive discussion of the relation between chemical, electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work." Gibbs, who remained in New Haven, was represented at the award ceremony by Commander <a href="Richardson%20Clover">Richardson Clover</a>, the US naval attaché in London.

In his autobiography, mathematician <a href="Gian-Carlo%20Rota">Gian-Carlo Rota</a> tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of <a href="Sterling%20Library">Sterling Library</a> and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs's course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincaré, Boltzmann, <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, and <a href="Ernst%20Mach">Ernst Mach</a>. From this, Rota concluded that Gibbs's work was better known among the scientific elite of his day than the published material suggests. Lynde Wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of Gibbs. That Gibbs succeeded in interesting his European correspondents in his work is demonstrated by the fact that his monograph "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" was translated into German (then the leading language for chemistry) by <a href="Wilhelm%20Ostwald">Wilhelm Ostwald</a> in 1892 and into French by <a href="Henri%20Louis%20Le%20Ch%C3%A2telier">Henri Louis Le Châtelier</a> in 1899.

Gibbs's most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs's lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist <a href="Hendrik%20Willem%20Bakhuis%20Roozeboom">H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom</a>, who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations, thereby assuring it of widespread use. In industrial chemistry, Gibbs's thermodynamics found many applications during the early 20th century, from electrochemistry to the development of the <a href="Haber%20process">Haber process</a> for the synthesis of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>.

When Dutch physicist <a href="Johannes%20Diderik%20van%20der%20Waals">J. D. van der Waals</a> received the 1910 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize</a> "for his work on the <a href="equation%20of%20state">equation of state</a> for gases and liquids" he acknowledged the great influence of Gibbs's work on that subject. <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a> received the 1918 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly his 1900 paper on <a href="Planck%27s%20law">Planck's law</a> for quantized <a href="black-body%20radiation">black-body radiation</a>. That work was based largely on the thermodynamics of Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Planck declared that Gibbs's name "not only in America but in the whole world will ever be reckoned among the most renowned theoretical physicists of all times."

The first half of the 20th century saw the publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of <a href="chemical%20thermodynamics">chemical thermodynamics</a>, both of which used and extended Gibbs's work in that field: these were "Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Processes" (1923), by <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> and <a href="Merle%20Randall">Merle Randall</a>, and "Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs" (1933), by <a href="Edward%20A.%20Guggenheim">Edward A. Guggenheim</a>.

Gibbs's work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics. According to mathematical physicist <a href="Arthur%20Wightman">Arthur Wightman</a>,

Initially unaware of Gibbs's contributions in that field, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904. After reading Gibbs's textbook (which was translated into German by <a href="Ernst%20Zermelo">Ernst Zermelo</a> in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs's treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs's work.

Gibbs's early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call "<a href="convex%20analysis">convex analysis</a>", including ideas that, according to <a href="Barry%20Simon">Barry Simon</a>, "lay dormant for about seventy-five years". Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs's work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the <a href="Gibbs%20lemma">Gibbs lemma</a> in <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>, the <a href="Gibbs%27%20inequality">Gibbs inequality</a> in <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, as well as <a href="Gibbs%20sampling">Gibbs sampling</a> in <a href="computational%20statistics">computational statistics</a>.

The development of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook "<a href="Vector%20Analysis">Vector Analysis</a>", based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.

At Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the <a href="triode">triode</a> amplifier and has been called the "father of radio". De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization "that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the <a href="Electromagnetic%20radiation">higher theory of waves</a> and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power." Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.

Gibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of <a href="Irving%20Fisher">Irving Fisher</a>, who received the first Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as "Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices", Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the <a href="General%20equilibrium%20theory">general equilibrium</a> of markets, and he used Gibbs's vectorial notation. Gibbs's protegé Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate <a href="Paul%20Samuelson">Paul Samuelson</a>. In 1947, Samuelson published "<a href="Foundations%20of%20Economic%20Analysis">Foundations of Economic Analysis</a>", based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as <a href="Epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraph</a> a remark attributed to Gibbs: "Mathematics is a language." Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his "debts were not primarily to <a href="Vilfredo%20Pareto">Pareto</a> or <a href="Eugen%20Slutsky">Slutsky</a>, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale."

Mathematician <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> cited Gibbs's use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as "the first great revolution of twentieth century physics" and as a major influence on his conception of <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>. Wiener explained in the preface to his book "<a href="The%20Human%20Use%20of%20Human%20Beings">The Human Use of Human Beings</a>" that it was "devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general."

When the German physical chemist <a href="Walther%20Nernst">Walther Nernst</a> visited Yale in 1906 to give the <a href="Silliman%20Memorial%20Lectures">Silliman lecture</a>, he was surprised to find no tangible memorial for Gibbs. Nernst donated his $500 lecture fee to the university to help pay for a suitable monument. This was finally unveiled in 1912, in the form of a bronze bas-relief by sculptor <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, installed in the Sloane Physics Laboratory. In 1910, the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> established the <a href="Willard%20Gibbs%20Award">Willard Gibbs Award</a> for eminent work in pure or applied chemistry. In 1923, the <a href="American%20Mathematical%20Society">American Mathematical Society</a> endowed the <a href="Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs%20Lectureship">Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship</a>, "to show the public some idea of the aspects of mathematics and its applications".

In 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by <a href="Lars%20Onsager">Lars Onsager</a>. Onsager, who much like Gibbs, focused on applying new mathematical ideas to problems in physical chemistry, won the 1968 Nobel Prize in chemistry. In addition to establishing the Josiah Willard Gibbs Laboratories and the J. Willard Gibbs Assistant Professorship in Mathematics, Yale has also hosted two symposia dedicated to Gibbs's life and work, one in 1989 and another on the centenary of his death, in 2003. <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a> endowed a J. Willard Gibbs Professorship of Thermomechanics, held as of 2014 by Bernard Coleman.

Gibbs was elected in 1950 to the <a href="Hall%20of%20Fame%20for%20Great%20Americans">Hall of Fame for Great Americans</a>. The <a href="oceanographic%20research%20ship">oceanographic research ship</a> <a href="USNS%20Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs%20%28T-AGOR-1%29">USNS "Josiah Willard Gibbs" (T-AGOR-1)</a> was in service with the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> from 1958 to 1971. <a href="Gibbs%20%28crater%29">Gibbs crater</a>, near the eastern <a href="Lunar%20limb">limb</a> of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, was named in the scientist's honor in 1964.

Edward Guggenheim introduced the symbol "G" for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by <a href="Dirk%20ter%20Haar">Dirk ter Haar</a> in 1966. This notation is now universal and is recommended by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a>. In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name "gibbs" (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy <a href="calorie">calorie</a> per <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>, but this usage did not become common, and the corresponding <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI</a> unit <a href="joule">joule</a> per kelvin carries no special name.

In 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known. Einstein replied: "<a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Lorentz</a>", adding "I never met Willard Gibbs; perhaps, had I done so, I might have placed him beside Lorentz."

In 1909, the American historian and novelist <a href="Henry%20Adams">Henry Adams</a> finished an essay entitled "The Rule of Phase Applied to History", in which he sought to apply Gibbs's phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. <a href="William%20James">William James</a>, Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams's tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society. The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in "The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma", edited by Henry Adams's younger brother <a href="Brooks%20Adams">Brooks</a>.

In the 1930s, feminist poet <a href="Muriel%20Rukeyser">Muriel Rukeyser</a> became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work ("Gibbs", included in the collection "A Turning Wind", published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography ("Willard Gibbs", 1942). According to Rukeyser:

In 1946, "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" magazine illustrated a cover story on "Fundamental Science" with a representation of the <a href="Maxwell%27s%20thermodynamic%20surface">thermodynamic surface</a> that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. Rukeyser called this surface a "statue of water" and the magazine saw in it "the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms." The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a <a href="radar">radar</a> screen, an <a href="oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> waveform, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton's</a> apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.

Gibbs's nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser's biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs's former students to produce a more technically oriented biography. Rukeyser's approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs's former student and protégé Edwin Wilson. With Van Name's and Wilson's encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.

Both Gibbs and Rukeyser's biography of him figure prominently in the poetry collection "True North" (1997) by <a href="Stephanie%20Strickland">Stephanie Strickland</a>. In fiction, Gibbs appears as the mentor to character Kit Traverse in <a href="Thomas%20Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>'s novel "<a href="Against%20the%20Day">Against the Day</a>" (2006). That novel also prominently discusses the birefringence of <a href="Iceland%20spar">Iceland spar</a>, an optical phenomenon that Gibbs investigated.

In 2005, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> issued the "American Scientists" commemorative <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> series designed by artist <a href="Victor%20Stabin">Victor Stabin</a>, depicting Gibbs, <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, <a href="Barbara%20McClintock">Barbara McClintock</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. The <a href="first%20day%20of%20issue">first day of issue</a> ceremony for the series was held on May 4 at Yale University's Luce Hall and was attended by <a href="John%20Marburger">John Marburger</a>, scientific advisor to the President of the United States, <a href="Rick%20Levin">Rick Levin</a>, president of Yale, and family members of the scientists honored, including physician John W. Gibbs, a distant cousin of Willard Gibbs.

Kenneth R. Jolls, a professor of chemical engineering at <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</a> and an expert on graphical methods in thermodynamics, consulted on the design of the stamp honoring Gibbs. The stamp identifies Gibbs as a "thermodynamicist" and features a diagram from the 4th edition of Maxwell's "Theory of Heat", published in 1875, which illustrates Gibbs's thermodynamic surface for water. <a href="Microprinting">Microprinting</a> on the <a href="Collar%20%28clothing%29">collar</a> of Gibbs's portrait depicts his original mathematical equation for the change in the energy of a substance in terms of its entropy and the other state variables.

Hoysala Empire

The Hoysala Empire was a <a href="Kannada%20people">Kannadiga</a> power originating from the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, that ruled most of what is now <a href="Karnataka%2C%20India">Karnataka, India</a>, between the 10th and the 14th centuries. The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a> but was later moved to <a href="Halebidu">Halebidu</a>.

The Hoysala rulers were originally from <a href="Malenadu">Malenadu</a>, an elevated region in the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a>. In the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a> and <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Kalyani">Kalachuris of Kalyani</a>, they annexed areas of present-day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the <a href="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> delta in present-day <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>. By the 13th century, they governed most of Karnataka, minor parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a>.

The Hoysala era was an important period in the development of art, architecture, and religion in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>. The empire is remembered today primarily for <a href="Hoysala%20architecture">Hoysala architecture</a>. Over a hundred surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka.

Well known temples "which exhibit an amazing display of sculptural exuberance" include the <a href="Chennakeshava%20Temple%2C%20Belur">Chennakeshava Temple, Belur</a>, the <a href="Hoysaleswara%20Temple">Hoysaleswara Temple</a>, <a href="Halebidu">Halebidu</a>, and the <a href="Chennakesava%20Temple%2C%20Somanathapura">Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura</a>. The Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts, encouraging literature to flourish in <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada</a> and <a href="Vedic%20and%20Sanskrit%20literature">Sanskrit</a>.

Kannada folklore tells a tale of a young man, Sala, who saved his <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> guru, Sudatta, by striking dead a tiger he encountered near the temple of the goddess Vasantika at Angadi, now called Sosevuru. The word "strike" literally translates to "hoy" in <a href="Old%20Kannada">Old Kannada</a>, hence the name "Hoy-sala". This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription of Vishnuvardhana (1117), but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story it remains in the realm of folklore. The legend may have come into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana's victory over the <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Cholas</a> at <a href="Talakadu">Talakadu</a> as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical warrior Sala and a tiger, the tiger being the emblem of the Cholas.

Early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas were descendants of the <a href="Yadu">Yadava</a> by referring to the Yadava "vamsa" (clan) as the "Hoysala "vamsa"". But there are no early records directly linking the Hoysalas to the Yadavas of <a href="North%20India">North India</a>.

Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of Malenadu based on numerous inscriptions calling them "Maleparolganda" or "Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs" ("Malepas"). This title in the Kannada language was proudly used by the Hoysala kings as their royal signature in their inscriptions. Literary sources from that time in Kannada ("Jatakatilaka") and Sanskrit ("Gadyakarnamrita") have also helped confirm they were natives of the region known today as Karnataka.

The first Hoysala family record is dated 950 and names Arekalla as the chieftain, followed by Maruga and Nripa Kama I (976). The next ruler, Munda (1006–1026), was succeeded by Nripa Kama II who held such titles as "Permanadi" that show an early alliance with the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20dynasty">Western Ganga dynasty</a>. From these modest beginnings, the Hoysala dynasty began its transformation into a strong subordinate of the Western Chalukya Empire. Through <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a>'s expansive military conquests, the Hoysalas achieved the status of a real kingdom for the first time. He wrested <a href="Mysore%20State">Gangavadi</a> from the Cholas in 1116 and moved the capital from Belur to Halebidu.

Vishnuvardhana's ambition of creating an independent empire was fulfilled by his grandson Veera Ballala II, who freed the Hoysalas from subordination in 1187–1193. Thus the Hoysalas began as subordinates of the Western Chalukya Empire and gradually established their own empire in Karnataka with such strong Hoysala kings as Vishnuvardhana, <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20II">Veera Ballala II</a> and later <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20III">Veera Ballala III</a>. During this time, the Deccan Plateau saw a four-way struggle for hegemony – <a href="Pandyan%20dynasty">Pandyan</a>, <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya</a> and <a href="Seuna%20%28Yadava%29%20dynasty">Seuna</a> being the other kingdoms. Veera Ballala II defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom. He assumed the title "Establisher of the Chola Kingdom" ("Cholarajyapratishtacharya"), "Emperor of the south" ("Dakshina Chakravarthi") and "Hoysala emperor" ("Hoysala Chakravarthi"). He founded the city of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> according to Kannada folklore.

The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a> a provincial capital and giving them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan. <a href="Vira%20Narasimha%20II">Vira Narasimha II</a>'s son <a href="Vira%20Someshwara">Vira Someshwara</a> earned the honorific "uncle" ("Mamadi") from the Pandyas and Cholas. The Hoysala influence spread over Pandya kingdom also. Toward the end of the 13th century, <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20III">Veera Ballala III</a> recaptured territory in the Tamil country which had been lost to the Pandya uprising, thus uniting the northern and southern portions of the kingdom.

Major political changes were taking place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when significant areas of <a href="North%20India">northern India</a> were under Muslim rule. <a href="Alauddin%20Khalji">Alauddin Khalji</a>, the Sultan of Delhi, was determined to bring South India under his domain and sent his commander, <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a>, on a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital <a href="Daulatabad%2C%20Maharashtra">Devagiri</a> in 1311. The Seuna empire was subjugated by 1318 and the Hoysala capital <a href="Halebidu">Halebidu</a> was sacked twice, in <a href="Siege%20of%20Dwarasamudra">1311</a> and 1327.

By 1336, the Sultan had conquered the Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a> and the tiny kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only remaining Hindu empire who resisted the invading armies. Veera Ballala III stationed himself at <a href="Tiruvannamalai">Tiruvannamalai</a> and offered stiff resistance to invasions from the north and the <a href="Madurai%20Sultanate">Madurai Sultanate</a> to the south. Then, after nearly three decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed at the battle of Madurai in 1343, and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by <a href="Harihara%20I">Harihara I</a> in the <a href="Tungabhadra%20River">Tungabhadra River</a> region. This new Hindu kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and come to be known as the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>.

The Hoysala administration supported itself through revenues from an agrarian economy. The kings gave grants of land as rewards for service to beneficiaries who then became landlords to tenants producing agricultural goods and forest products. There were two types of landlords ("gavunda"); "gavunda" of people ("praja gavunda") was lower in status than the wealthy lord of "gavundas" ("prabhu gavunda"). The highlands ("<a href="malnad">malnad</a>" regions) with its <a href="temperate">temperate</a> climate was suitable for raising cattle and the planting of orchards and spices. <a href="Paddy%20field">Paddy</a> and <a href="cereal">corn</a> were staple crops in the <a href="tropical">tropical</a> plains ("Bailnad"). The Hoysalas collected taxes on irrigation systems including tanks, reservoirs with <a href="sluice">sluice</a>s, <a href="canal">canal</a>s and wells which were built and maintained at the expense of local villagers. <a href="Irrigation%20tank">Irrigation tank</a>s such as "Vishnusagara", "Shantisagara", "Ballalarayasagara" were created at the expense of the state.

Importing horses for use as general transportation and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard. The forests were harvested for rich woods such as <a href="teak">teak</a> which was exported through ports located in the area of present-day <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>. <a href="Song%20Dynasty">Song dynasty</a> records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, <a href="ebony">ebony</a>, <a href="Agarwood">aloe wood</a>, perfumes, <a href="sandalwood">sandalwood</a>, <a href="camphor">camphor</a> and condiments to China, <a href="Dhofar">Dhofar</a>, <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, and <a href="Siraf">Siraf</a> (the entryport to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> and <a href="Persia">Persia</a>). Architects ("Vishwakarmas"), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities.

The village assembly was responsible for collecting government land taxes. Land revenue was called "Siddhaya" and included the original assessment ("Kula") plus various cesses. Taxes were levied on professions, marriages, goods in transit on chariots or carriages, and domesticated animals. Taxes on commodities (gold, precious stones, perfumes, sandalwood, ropes, yarn, housing, hearths, shops, cattle pans, sugarcane presses) as well as produce (black pepper, betel leaves, ghee, paddy, spices, palm leaves, coconuts, sugar) are noted in village records. The village assembly could levy a tax for a specific purpose such as construction of a <a href="Irrigation%20tank">water tank</a>.

In its administrative practices, the Hoysala Empire followed some of the well-established and proven methods of its predecessors covering administrative functions such as cabinet organisation and command, the structure of local governing bodies and the division of territory. Records show the names of many high-ranking positions reporting directly to the king. Senior ministers were called "Pancha Pradhanas", ministers responsible for foreign affairs were designated "Sandhivigrahi" and the chief treasurer was "Mahabhandari" or "Hiranyabhandari". "Dandanayakas" were in charge of armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the "Dharmadhikari".

The kingdom was divided into provinces named "Nadu", "Vishaya", "Kampana" and "Desha", listed in descending order of geographical size. Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister ("Mahapradhana") and a treasurer ("Bhandari") that reported to the ruler of that province ("Dandanayaka"). Under this local ruler were officials called "Heggaddes" and "Gavundas" who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as <a href="Alupas">Alupas</a> continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.

An elite and well-trained force of bodyguards known as "Garudas" protected the members of the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death. <a href="Hero%20stone">Hero stones ("virgal")</a> erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.

King Vishnuvardhana's coins had the legends "victor at Nolambavadi" ("Nolambavadigonda"), "victor at Talakad" ("Talakadugonda"), "chief of the Malepas" ("Maleparolganda"), "Brave of Malepa" ("malapavira") in <a href="Kannada%20script">Hoysala style Kannada</a> script. Their gold coin was called "Honnu" or "Gadyana" and weighed 62 <a href="Grain%20%28measure%29">grains</a> of gold. "Pana" or "Hana" was a tenth of the "Honnu", "Haga" was a fourth of the "Pana" and "Visa" was fourth of "Haga". There were other coins called "Bele" and "Kani".

The defeat of the Jain Western Gangas by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a> and <a href="Lingayatism">Lingayatism</a> in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> and <a href="Panchakuta%20Basadi%2C%20Kambadahalli">Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli</a>. The decline of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in <a href="South%20India">South India</a> began in the eighth century with the spread of <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>'s <a href="Advaita%20Vedanta">Advaita Vedanta</a>. The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a> and <a href="Balligavi">Balligavi</a>. Shantala Devi, queen of Vishnuvardhana, was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe Chennigaraya temple in Belur, evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions.

During the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present-day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, <a href="Basava">Basava</a>, <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> and <a href="Ramanuja">Ramanuja</a>.

While the origin of Lingayatism is debated, the movement grew through its association with Basava in the 12th century.
Madhvacharya was critical of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion. His <a href="Dvaita%20Vedanta">Dvaita Vedanta</a> gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight <a href="matha">matha</a>s in <a href="Udupi">Udupi</a>. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a>, preached the way of devotion ("<a href="bhakti">bhakti</a> marga") and wrote "Sribhashya", a critique on Adi Shankara's Advaita.

The effect of these religious developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The <a href="Saluva%20dynasty">Saluva</a>, <a href="Tuluva%20dynasty">Tuluva</a> and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the later <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The later saints of Madhvacharya's order, <a href="Jayatirtha">Jayatirtha</a>, <a href="Vyasatirtha">Vyasatirtha</a>, <a href="Sripadaraja">Sripadaraja</a>, <a href="Vadiraja%20Tirtha">Vadiraja Tirtha</a> and devotees ("dasa") such as <a href="Vijaya%20Dasa">Vijaya Dasa</a>, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide. His teachings inspired later philosophers like <a href="Vallabha">Vallabha</a> in <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and <a href="Chaitanya%20Mahaprabhu">Chaitanya Mahaprabhu</a> in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. Another wave of devotion ("bhakti") in the 17th century–18th century found inspiration in his teachings.

Hoysala society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. During this period, the society became increasingly sophisticated. The status of women was varied. Some royal women were involved in administrative matters as shown in contemporary records describing Queen Umadevi's administration of Halebidu in the absence of Veera Ballala II during his long military campaigns in northern territories. She also fought and defeated some antagonistic <a href="feudalism">feudal rebels</a>. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Queen Shantala Devi's skill in dance and music, and the 12th century <a href="vachana%20sahitya">vachana sahitya</a> poet and Lingayati mystic <a href="Akka%20Mahadevi">Akka Mahadevi</a>'s devotion to the "bhakti" movement is well known. Temple dancers ("<a href="Devadasi">Devadasi</a>") were common and some were well educated and accomplished in the arts. These qualifications gave them more freedom than other urban and rural women who were restricted to daily mundane tasks. The practice of <a href="sati%20%28practice%29">sati</a> in a voluntary form was prevalent and prostitution was socially acceptable. As in most of India, a <a href="caste%20system%20in%20India">caste system</a> was conspicuously present.

Trade on the west coast brought many foreigners to India including <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> and people from the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>. Migration of people within Southern India as a result of the expansion of the empire produced an influx of new cultures and skills. In South India, towns were called "Pattana" or "Pattanam" and the marketplace, "Nagara" or "Nagaram", the marketplace serving as the nuclei of a city. Some towns such as <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a> developed from a religious settlement in the 7th century to an important trading center by the 12th century with the arrival of rich traders, while towns like Belur attained the atmosphere of a regal city when King Vishnuvardhana built the Chennakesava Temple there. Large temples supported by royal patronage served religious, social, and judiciary purposes, elevating the king to the level of "God on earth".

Temple building served a commercial as well as a religious function and was not limited to any particular sect of Hinduism. <a href="Shaivism">Shaiva</a> merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur, elevating Halebidu to an important city as well. Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects, the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions. Temples built by rich landlords in rural areas fulfilled fiscal, political, cultural and religious needs of the agrarian communities. Irrespective of patronage, large temples served as establishments that provided employment to hundreds of people of various guilds and professions sustaining local communities as Hindu temples began to take on the shape of wealthy <a href="vihara">Buddhist monasteries</a>.

Although Sanskrit literature remained popular during the Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works were written in the "Champu" style, but distinctive Kannada metres became more widely accepted. The "Sangatya" metre used in compositions, "Shatpadi" (six line), "<a href="tripadi">tripadi</a>" (three line) metres in verses and "ragale" (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of <a href="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>s (Jain saviour figures).

The Hoysala court supported scholars such as <a href="Janna">Janna</a>, Rudrabhatta, Harihara and his nephew Raghavanka, whose works are enduring masterpieces in Kannada. In 1209, the Jain scholar Janna wrote "Yashodharacharite", the story of a king who intends to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to a local deity, Mariamma. Taking pity on the boys, the king releases them and gives up the practice of human sacrifice. In honour of this work, Janna received the title "Emperor among poets" ("Kavichakravarthi") from King Veera Ballala II.

<a href="Rudrabhatta">Rudrabhatta</a>, a <a href="Smarta%20Tradition">Smarta</a> Brahmin, was the earliest well-known Brahminical writer. HIs patron was Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II. Based on the earlier work "<a href="Vishnu%20Purana">Vishnu Purana</a>", he wrote "Jagannatha Vijaya" in the "Champu" style relating the life of <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> leading up to his fight with the demon <a href="Banasura">Banasura</a>.

<a href="Harihara%20%28poet%29">Harihara</a>, (also known as Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the "Girijakalyana" in the old Jain "Champu" style which describes the marriage of Shiva and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> in ten sections. He was one of the earliest Virashaiva writers who was not part of the "vachana" literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants ("Karanikas") from Halebidu and spent many years in <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a> writing more than one hundred "ragales" (poems in blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). <a href="Raghavanka">Raghavanka</a> was the first to introduce the "Shatpadi" metre into Kannada literature in his "Harishchandra kavya" which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.

In Sanskrit, the philosopher <a href="Madhvacharya">Madhvacharya</a> wrote the "Rigbhshya" on the <a href="Brahma%20Sutras">Brahma Sutras</a> (a logical explanation of Hindu scriptures, the Vedas) as well as many polemical works rebutting the doctrines of other schools. He relied more on the <a href="Puranas">Puranas</a> than the <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> for logical proof of his philosophy. Another famous writing was "Rudraprshnabhashya" by Vidyatirtha.

The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">Dravidian</a> influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as "Karnata Dravida" as distinguished from the traditional "Dravida", and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.

A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine ("vimana") is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of <a href="Soapstone">Soapstone</a> (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.

The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at <a href="Ishvara%20Temple%20%28Arasikere%29">Arasikere</a> (1220), <a href="Amruthapura">Amruthapura</a> (1196), <a href="Belavadi">Belavadi</a> (1200), <a href="Lakshmi%20Narasimha%20Temple%2C%20Nuggehalli">Nuggehalli</a> (1246), <a href="Lakshminarayana%20Temple%2C%20Hosaholalu">Hosaholalu</a> (1250), <a href="Chennakeshava%20Temple%2C%20Aralaguppe">Aralaguppe</a> (1250), <a href="Bucesvara%20Temple%2C%20Koravangala">Korvangla</a> (1173), <a href="Lakshminarasimha%20Temple%2C%20Haranhalli">Haranhalli</a> (1235), <a href="Nageshvara-Chennakeshava%20Temple%20complex%2C%20Mosale">Mosale</a> and <a href="Mallikarjuna%20Temple%2C%20Basaralu">Basaralu</a> (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics. These depictions are generally clockwise in the traditional direction of circumambulation ("<a href="pradakshina">pradakshina</a>"). The temple of Halebidu has been described as an outstanding example of Hindu architecture and an important milestone in Indian architecture. The temples of Belur and Halebidu are a proposed <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites">world heritage sites</a>.

The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their <a href="Epigraphy">epigraph</a>s, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins. According to historian Sheldon Pollock, the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit, with Kannada dominating as the courtly language. Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called "Ghatikas". The local Kannada language was widely used in the rising number of devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity ("vachanas" and "devaranama"). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. Inscriptions on stone ("Shilashasana") and <a href="Indian%20copper%20plate%20inscriptions">copper plates</a> ("Tamarashasana") were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without ambiguity.

Hyderabad

Hyderabad ( ) is the capital of the <a href="States%20and%20union%20territories%20of%20India">Indian state</a> of <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> and "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" capital of <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Occupying along the banks of the <a href="Musi%20River%20%28India%29">Musi River</a>, <a href="Hyderabad%20City">Hyderabad City</a> has a population of about and about in <a href="Hyderabad%20Metropolitan%20Region">Hyderabad Metropolitan Region</a>, making it the <a href="List%20of%20most%20populous%20cities%20in%20India">fourth most populous city</a> and <a href="List%20of%20million-plus%20urban%20agglomerations%20in%20India">sixth most populous urban agglomeration</a> in India. At an average altitude of , much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including <a href="Hussain%20Sagar">Hussain Sagar</a>—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.

Established in 1591 by <a href="Muhammad%20Quli%20Qutb%20Shah">Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah</a>, Hyderabad remained under the rule of the <a href="Qutb%20Shahi%20dynasty">Qutb Shahi dynasty</a> for nearly a century before the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughals</a> captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy <a href="Qamar-ud-din%20Khan%2C%20Asif%20Jah%20I">Asif Jah I</a> declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the <a href="Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad">Nizams of Hyderabad</a>. The <a href="Hyderabad%20State">Nizam's dominions</a> became a <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> during the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, and remained so for , with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of <a href="Hyderabad%20State%20%281948%E2%80%9356%29">Hyderabad State</a> after it was brought into the <a href="Indian%20Union">Indian Union</a> in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Act%2C%201956">States Reorganisation Act, 1956</a>. Since 1956, <a href="Rashtrapati%20Nilayam">Rashtrapati Nilayam</a> in the city has been the winter office of the <a href="President%20of%20India">President of India</a>. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh%20Reorganisation%20Act%2C%202014">split from Andhra Pradesh</a> and the city became the joint capital of the two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.

Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the <a href="Charminar">Charminar</a>—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a> fort is another major landmark. The influence of <a href="Indo-Persian%20culture">Mughlai culture</a> is also evident in the region's <a href="Hyderabadi%20cuisine">distinctive cuisine</a>, which includes <a href="Hyderabadi%20biryani">Hyderabadi biryani</a> and <a href="Hyderabadi%20haleem">Hyderabadi haleem</a>. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The <a href="Telugu%20film%20industry">Telugu film industry</a> based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures. 

Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the "City of Pearls". Many of the city's traditional <a href="bazaar">bazaar</a>s remain open, including <a href="Laad%20Bazaar">Laad Bazaar</a>, <a href="Begum%20Bazaar">Begum Bazaar</a> and <a href="Sultan%20Bazaar">Sultan Bazaar</a>. Industrialisation throughout the attracted major Indian research, manufacturing and financial institutions, including <a href="Defence%20Research%20and%20Development%20Organization">Defence Research and Development Organization</a>, <a href="Bharat%20Heavy%20Electricals%20Limited">Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited</a>, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the <a href="National%20Geophysical%20Research%20Institute">National Geophysical Research Institute</a> and the <a href="Centre%20for%20Cellular%20and%20Molecular%20Biology">Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology</a>. <a href="Special%20economic%20zone">Special economic zone</a>s dedicated to <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> have encouraged companies from India and around the world to set up operations in Hyderabad. The emergence of <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> and <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> industries in the 1990s led to the area's naming as India's "<a href="Genome%20Valley">Genome Valley</a>". With an output of 74 billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a>.

According to <a href="John%20Everett-Heath">John Everett-Heath</a>, the author of "Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names", "Hyderabad" means "Haydar's city" or "lion city", from "<a href="haydar">haydar</a>" (lion) and "<a href="-abad">ābād</a>" (city), and was named to honour the <a href="Caliph">Caliph</a> <a href="Ali%20Ibn%20Abi%20Talib">Ali Ibn Abi Talib</a>, who was also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles. Andrew Petersen, a scholar of Islamic architecture, says the city was originally called "Baghnagar" (city of gardens). One popular theory suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the <a href="Golconda%20Sultanate">Golconda Sultanate</a>, named it after <a href="Bhagmati">Bhagmati</a>, a local "<a href="nautch">nautch</a>" (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love. She converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and adopted the title "Hyder Mahal". The city was named as "Hyderabad" in her honour.

According to German traveller <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Poser">Heinrich von Poser</a>, whose travelogue of the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> was translated by Gita Dharampal-Frick of <a href="Heidelberg%20University">Heidelberg University</a>, there were two names for the city: "On 3 December 1622, we reached the city of Bagneger or Hederabat, the seat of the king Sultan Mehemet Culi Cuttub Shah and the capital of the kingdom". French traveller <a href="Jean%20de%20Th%C3%A9venot">Jean de Thévenot</a> visited the Deccan region in 1666–1667 refers to the city in his book "Travels in India" as "Bagnagar and Aiderabad".

Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> sites that may date from 500 <a href="BCE">BCE</a>. The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was known as "<a href="Golkonda">Golkonda</a>" (Golla Konda-"shepherd's hill"), and was ruled by the <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya dynasty</a> from 624 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a> to 1075 CE. Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golkonda came under the control of the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya dynasty</a> from 1158, whose seat of power was at <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a>, northeast of modern Hyderabad.

The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the <a href="Khalji%20dynasty">Khalji dynasty</a> in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan <a href="Alauddin%20Khalji">Alauddin Khalji</a> of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>. This lasted until 1321, when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a>, Allaudin Khalji's general. During this period, Alauddin Khalji took the "<a href="Koh-i-Noor">Koh-i-Noor</a>" diamond, which is said to have been mined from the <a href="Kollur%20Mine">Kollur Mine</a>s of Golkonda, to Delhi. <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Tughluq">Muhammad bin Tughluq</a> succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the <a href="Tughlaq%20dynasty">Tughlaq dynasty</a> until 1347 when <a href="Ala-ud-Din%20Bahman%20Shah">Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah</a>, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a> in the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a>, with <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a>, west of Hyderabad, as its capital. The Hyderabad area was under the control of the <a href="Musunuri%20Nayaks">Musunuri Nayaks</a> at this time, who, however, were forced to cede it to the Bahmani Sultanate in 1364. The Bahmani kings ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.
<a href="Quli%20Qutb%20Mulk">Sultan Quli</a>, a governor of Golkonda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the <a href="Qutb%20Shahi%20dynasty">Qutb Shahi dynasty</a> in 1518; he rebuilt the mud-fort of Golconda and named the city "Muhammad nagar". The fifth sultan, <a href="Muhammad%20Quli%20Qutb%20Shah">Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah</a>, established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591, to avoid the water shortages experienced at Golkonda. During his rule, he had the <a href="Charminar">Charminar</a> and <a href="Mecca%20Masjid">Mecca Masjid</a> built in the city. On 21 September 1687, the Golkonda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a> after a <a href="Siege%20of%20Golconda">year-long siege</a> of the Golkonda fort. The annexed city "Hyderabad" was renamed "Darul Jihad" (House of War), whereas its state "Golconda" was renamed "Deccan Suba" (Deccan province) and the capital was moved from Golconda to <a href="Aurangabad%2C%20Maharashtra">Aurangabad</a>, about northwest of Hyderabad.

In 1714 <a href="Farrukhsiyar">Farrukhsiyar</a>, the Mughal emperor, appointed <a href="Asif%20Jah%20I">Asif Jah I</a> to be Viceroy of the Deccan, with the title "Nizam-ul-Mulk" (Administrator of the Realm). In 1724, Asif Jah I defeated <a href="Mubariz%20Khan">Mubariz Khan</a> to establish autonomy over the "Deccan Suba", named the region "<a href="Hyderabad%20State">Hyderabad Deccan</a>", and started what came to be known as the <a href="Asaf%20Jahi%20dynasty">Asaf Jahi dynasty</a>. Subsequent rulers retained the title "Nizam ul-Mulk" and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or <a href="Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad">Nizams of Hyderabad</a>. The death of Asif Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of <a href="Ali%20Khan%20Asaf%20Jah%20II">Asif Jah II</a>, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the treaty of <a href="Machilipatnam">Machilipatnam</a>, surrendering the coastal region to the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> in return for a fixed annual rent.

In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. In response to regular threats from <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a> (Dalwai of <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a>), <a href="Baji%20Rao%20I">Baji Rao I</a> (<a href="Peshwa">Peshwa</a> of the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a>), and Basalath Jung (Asif Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Bussy-Castelnau">Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau</a>), the Nizam signed a <a href="subsidiary%20alliance">subsidiary alliance</a> with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a> to occupy <a href="Bolarum">Bolarum</a> (modern <a href="Secunderabad">Secunderabad</a>) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.

Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of <a href="Hussain%20Sagar%20Lake">Hussain Sagar Lake</a>, and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, <a href="Hussain%20Sagar%20Thermal%20Power%20Station">electricity</a>, telecommunications, universities, industries, and <a href="Begumpet%20Airport">Begumpet Airport</a>. The Nizams ruled their <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> from Hyderabad during the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>.

After India <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">gained independence</a>, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the <a href="Indian%20Union">Indian Union</a>. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> and the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India">Communist Party of India</a>, began agitating against <a href="Osman%20Ali%20Khan%2C%20Asaf%20Jah%20VII">Nizam VII</a> in 1948. On 17 September that year, the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed <a href="Operation%20Polo">Operation Polo</a>. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an <a href="Instrument%20of%20Accession">Instrument of Accession</a>, which made him the "<a href="Rajpramukh">Rajpramukh</a>" (Princely Governor) of the state until 31 October 1956.

Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the <a href="Telangana%20uprising">Telangana uprising</a> against the <a href="Indian%20feudalism">feudal</a> lords of the <a href="Telangana%20region">Telangana region</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20India">Constitution of India</a>, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Act%23Three%20types%20of%20states">part B states</a> of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. In his 1955 report "Thoughts on Linguistic States", <a href="B.%20R.%20Ambedkar">B. R. Ambedkar</a>, then chairman of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20India%23Drafting">Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution</a>, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the <a href="second%20capital">second capital</a> of India because of its amenities and strategic central location. Since 1956, the <a href="Rashtrapati%20Nilayam">Rashtrapati Nilayam</a> in Hyderabad has been the second official residence and business office of the <a href="President%20of%20India">President of India</a>; the President stays once a year in winter and conducts official business particularly relating to Southern India.

On 1 November 1956 the states of India <a href="States%20Reorganisation%20Act%23The%20States%20Reorganisation%20Act">were reorganised</a> by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form the modern states of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> and Andhra Pradesh. The nine <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>- and <a href="Urdu%20language">Urdu</a>-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking <a href="Andhra%20State">Andhra State</a> to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the <a href="Telangana%20movement">Telangana movement</a>, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. The city suffered several explosions: one at <a href="Dilsukhnagar">Dilsukhnagar</a> in 2002 claimed two lives; terrorist bombs in <a href="Mecca%20Masjid%20bombing">May</a> and <a href="25%20August%202007%20Hyderabad%20bombings">August</a> 2007 caused <a href="Religious%20violence%20in%20India">communal tension and riots</a>; and two bombs exploded in <a href="2013%20Hyderabad%20blasts">February 2013</a>. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state, and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of <a href="Parliament%20of%20India">Parliament</a> <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">passed</a> the <a href="Telangana%20Bill">Telangana Bill</a>. With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.

Situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India, Hyderabad is south of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, southeast of <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, and north of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> by road.

Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. After the <a href="Siege%20of%20Delhi">fall of Delhi in 1857</a>, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the <a href="Indian%20sub%20continent">Indian sub continent</a>, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.

A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> are official languages of Telangana.

Hyderabad has hosted many international cricket matches, including matches in the 1987 and the 1996 <a href="ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">ICC Cricket World Cup</a>s. The <a href="Hyderabad%20cricket%20team">Hyderabad cricket team</a> represents the city in the <a href="Ranji%20Trophy">Ranji Trophy</a>—a <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> tournament among India's states and cities. Hyderabad is also home to the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">Indian Premier League</a> franchise <a href="Sunrisers%20Hyderabad">Sunrisers Hyderabad</a> champions of <a href="2016%20Indian%20Premier%20League">2016 Indian Premier League</a>.

During British rule, Secunderabad became a well-known sporting centre and many race courses, parade grounds and <a href="polo">polo</a> fields were built. Many elite clubs formed by the Nizams and the British such as the <a href="Secunderabad%20Club">Secunderabad Club</a>, the <a href="Nizam%20Club">Nizam Club</a> and the <a href="Hyderabad%20Race%20Club">Hyderabad Race Club</a>, which is known for its horse racing especially the annual Deccan derby, still exist. In more recent times, motorsports has become popular with the <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh%20Motor%20Sports%20Club">Andhra Pradesh Motor Sports Club</a> organising popular events such as the Deccan Mile Drag, <a href="Regularity%20rally">TSD Rallies</a> and 4x4 off-road rallying.

As of 2018, the most commonly used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government-owned services such as light railways and buses, as well as privately operated taxis and <a href="auto%20rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a>s. These altogether serve 3.5 million passengers daily. Bus services operate from the <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi%20Bus%20Station">Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station</a> in the city centre with a fleet of 3800 buses serving 3.3 million passengers. 

Hyderabad is also served by Metro rail, a light-rail transport system. The first phase of the metro rail was inaugurated in November 2017 from Nagole to Ameerpet and Miyapur to Ameerpet followed by L.B. Nagar to Ameerpet in October 2018. <a href="Hyderabad%20Metro">Hyderabad Metro</a> is currently the second-largest metro rail network in India, with plans for further expansion.
Hyderabad's <a href="Hyderabad%20Multi-Modal%20Transport%20System">Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS)</a>, is a three line suburban rail service with 121 services carrying 180,000 passengers daily. Complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by <a href="Setwin">Setwin</a> (Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities). Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad; the main, and largest, station is <a href="Secunderabad%20Railway%20Station">Secunderabad Railway Station</a>, which serves as <a href="Indian%20Railways">Indian Railways</a>' <a href="South%20Central%20Railway%20zone">South Central Railway zone</a> headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad. Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are <a href="Hyderabad%20Deccan%20Station">Hyderabad Deccan Station</a>, <a href="Kacheguda%20Railway%20Station">Kacheguda Railway Station</a>, <a href="Begumpet%20Railway%20Station">Begumpet Railway Station</a>, <a href="Malkajgiri%20Railway%20Station">Malkajgiri Railway Station</a> and <a href="Lingampally%20Railway%20Station">Lingampally Railway Station</a>.

, there are over 5.3 million vehicles operating in the city, of which 4.3 million are two-wheelers and 1.04 million four-wheelers. The large number of vehicles coupled with relatively low road coverage—roads occupy only 9.5% of the total city area—has led to widespread traffic congestion especially since 80% of passengers and 60% of freight are transported by road. The Inner Ring Road, the <a href="Outer%20Ring%20Road%20%28Hyderabad%29">Outer Ring Road</a>, the <a href="Elevated%20Expressways%20in%20Hyderabad%23P.V.%20Narasimha%20Rao%20Elevated%20Expressway">Hyderabad Elevated Expressway</a>, the longest flyover in India, and various <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29">interchanges</a>, overpasses and underpasses were built to ease the congestion. Maximum speed limits within the city are for two-wheelers and cars, for auto rickshaws and for <a href="light%20commercial%20vehicle">light commercial vehicle</a>s and buses.

Hyderabad sits at the junction of three <a href="National%20Highway%20%28India%29">National Highways</a> linking it to six other states: <a href="National%20Highway%2044%20%28India%29">NH-44</a> runs from <a href="Srinagar">Srinagar</a>, <a href="Jammu%20and%20kashmir">Jammu and kashmir</a>, in the north to <a href="Kanyakumari">Kanyakumari</a>, <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, in the south; <a href="National%20Highway%2065%20%28India%29">NH-65</a>, runs east-west between Machilipatnam, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, and <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>; <a href="National%20Highway%20163%20%28India%29">NH-163</a> links Hyderabad, <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> and <a href="Bhopalpatnam">Bhopalpatnam</a>, <a href="Chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh</a>; <a href="National%20Highway%20765%20%28India%29">NH-765</a> links Hyderabad, <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> to <a href="Srisailam">Srisailam</a>, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Five state highways, <a href="State%20Highway%201%20%28Telangana%29">SH-1</a> links Hyderabad, to <a href="Ramagundam">Ramagundam</a>, SH-2, SH-4, and SH-6, either start from, or pass through, Hyderabad.

Air traffic was previously handled via <a href="Begumpet%20Airport">Begumpet Airport</a>, but this was replaced by <a href="Rajiv%20Gandhi%20International%20Airport">Rajiv Gandhi International Airport</a> (RGIA) in 2008, with the capacity of handling 12 million passengers and 100,000 tonnes of cargo per annum. In 2011, <a href="Airports%20Council%20International">Airports Council International</a>, an autonomous body representing the world's airports, judged RGIA the world's best airport in the passenger category and the world's fifth best airport for service quality.

Dorset

Dorset (; <a href="Archaism">archaically</a>: Dorsetshire) is a <a href="counties%20of%20England">county</a> in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> on the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> coast. The <a href="ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England">ceremonial county</a> comprises the <a href="non-metropolitan%20county">non-metropolitan county</a>, which is governed by <a href="Dorset%20County%20Council">Dorset County Council</a>, and the <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary authority areas</a> of <a href="Poole">Poole</a> and <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>. Covering an area of , Dorset borders <a href="Devon">Devon</a> to the west, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> to the north-west, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> to the north-east, and <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> to the east. The <a href="county%20town">county town</a> is <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a> which is in the south. After the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">reorganisation of local government in 1974</a> the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the <a href="South%20East%20Dorset%20conurbation">South East Dorset conurbation</a>, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.

The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era. The <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">Romans</a> conquered Dorset's indigenous <a href="Durotriges">Celtic tribe</a>, and during the early Middle Ages, the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Saxons</a> settled the area and made Dorset a <a href="shire">shire</a> in the 7th century. The first recorded <a href="Vikings">Viking</a> raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century, and the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">Black Death</a> entered England at <a href="Melcombe%20Regis">Melcombe Regis</a> in 1348. Dorset has seen much civil unrest: in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, an uprising of <a href="Clubmen">vigilantes</a> was crushed by <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s forces in a pitched battle near <a href="Shaftesbury">Shaftesbury</a>; the doomed <a href="Monmouth%20Rebellion">Monmouth Rebellion</a> began at <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a>; and a group of farm labourers from <a href="Tolpuddle%20Martyrs">Tolpuddle</a> were instrumental in the formation of the <a href="Labour%20movement">trade union movement</a>. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>, and the large harbours of <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland</a> and <a href="Poole%20Harbour">Poole</a> were two of the main embarkation points. The former was the sailing venue in the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, and both have clubs or hire venues for <a href="sailing">sailing</a>, <a href="Cornish%20pilot%20gig">Cornish pilot gig</a> rowing, <a href="sea%20kayak">sea kayak</a>ing and <a href="powerboating">powerboating</a>.

Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated <a href="Downland">chalk downs</a>, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. Three-quarters of its coastline is part of the <a href="Jurassic%20Coast">Jurassic Coast</a> Natural <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as <a href="Lulworth%20Cove">Lulworth Cove</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Isle of Portland</a>, <a href="Chesil%20Beach">Chesil Beach</a> and <a href="Durdle%20Door">Durdle Door</a>. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of <a href="Great%20Britain%20road%20numbering%20scheme%23A%20roads">A roads</a> cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> and Portland, and an <a href="Bournemouth%20Airport">international airport</a>. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to the <a href="Great%20Dorset%20Steam%20Fair">Great Dorset Steam Fair</a>, one of the biggest events of its kind in Europe. It is the birthplace of <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and <a href="William%20Barnes">William Barnes</a>, whose poetry celebrates the ancient <a href="West%20Country%20English">Dorset dialect</a>.

Dorset derives its name from the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>. The <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romans</a> established the settlement in the 1st century and named it <a href="Durnovaria">Durnovaria</a> which was a Latinised version of a <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Common Brittonic</a> word possibly meaning "place with fist-sized pebbles". The <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Saxons</a> named the town Dornwaraceaster (the suffix "ceaster" being the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> name for a Roman town) and Dornsæte came into use as the name for the inhabitants of the area from "Dorn"—a reduced form of Dornwaraceaster—and the Old English word "sæte" meaning people. It is first mentioned in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" in AD 845 and in the 10th century the county's archaic name, "Dorseteschyre" (Dorsetshire), was first recorded.

The first human visitors to Dorset were <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> hunters, from around 8000 <a href="Before%20Christ">BC</a>. The first permanent <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> settlers appeared around 3000 BC and were responsible for the creation of the <a href="Dorset%20Cursus">Dorset Cursus</a>, a monument for ritual or ceremonial purposes. From 2800 BC onwards <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> farmers cleared Dorset's woodlands for agricultural use and Dorset's high chalk hills provided a location for numerous <a href="round%20barrows">round barrows</a>. During the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, the <a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">British</a> tribe known as the <a href="Durotriges">Durotriges</a> established a series of <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s across the county—most notably <a href="Maiden%20Castle%2C%20Dorset">Maiden Castle</a> which is one of the largest in Europe.

The Romans arrived in Dorset during their <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">conquest of Britain</a> in AD 43. Maiden Castle was captured by a <a href="Legio%20II%20Augusta">Roman legion</a> under the command of <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>, and the Roman settlement of Durnovaria was established nearby. <a href="Bokerley%20Dyke">Bokerley Dyke</a>, a large defensive ditch built by the county's post-Roman inhabitants near the border with modern-day <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, delayed the advance of the Saxons into Dorset for almost 150 years. However, by the end of the 7th century Dorset had fallen under Saxon control and been incorporated into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Wessex">Kingdom of Wessex</a>. The Saxons established a <a href="Diocese%20of%20Salisbury">diocese</a> at <a href="Sherborne">Sherborne</a> and Dorset was made a <a href="shire">shire</a>—an administrative district of Wessex and predecessor to the <a href="Ancient%20counties%20of%20England">English county</a> system—with borders that have changed little since. In 789 the first recorded <a href="Viking">Viking</a> attack on the British Isles took place in Dorset on the Portland coast, and they continued to raid into the county for the next two centuries.

After the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> in 1066, <a href="Feudalism%20in%20England">feudal</a> rule was established in Dorset and the bulk of the land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at <a href="Corfe%20Castle">Corfe</a>, <a href="Wareham%20Castle">Wareham</a> and <a href="Dorchester%20Castle">Dorchester</a> in the early part of the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of <a href="Purbeck%20Marble">Purbeck Marble</a> and the busy ports of <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a>, <a href="Melcombe%20Regis">Melcombe Regis</a>, <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> and <a href="Bridport">Bridport</a> brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>. The disease, more commonly known as the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>, created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country.

The <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a> (1536–1541) met little resistance in Dorset and many of the county's abbeys, including <a href="Shaftesbury%20Abbey">Shaftesbury</a>, <a href="Cerne%20Abbey">Cerne</a> and <a href="Milton%20Abbey%20School%23Abbey%20church">Milton</a>, were sold to private owners. In 1642, at the commencement of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, the <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> took control of the entire county apart from Poole and Lyme Regis. However, within three years their gains had been almost entirely reversed by the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarians</a>. An uprising of <a href="Clubmen">Clubmen</a>—vigilantes weary of the depredations of the war—took place in Dorset in 1645. Some 2,000 of these rebels offered battle to <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%203rd%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Lord Fairfax's</a> Parliamentary army at <a href="Hambledon%20Hill">Hambledon Hill</a> but they were easily routed. <a href="Sherborne%20Castle">Sherborne Castle</a> was taken by Fairfax that same year and in 1646 Corfe Castle, the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Dorset, was captured after an act of betrayal: both were subsequently <a href="Slighting">slighted</a>. The <a href="James%20Scott%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Monmouth">Duke of Monmouth's</a> unsuccessful <a href="Monmouth%20Rebellion">attempt to overthrow James II</a> began when he landed at Lyme Regis in 1685. A series of trials known as the <a href="Bloody%20Assizes">Bloody Assizes</a> took place to punish the rebels. Over a five-day period in Dorchester, <a href="Judge%20Jeffreys">Judge Jeffreys</a> presided over 312 cases: 74 of the accused were executed, 175 were <a href="Penal%20transportation">transported</a>, and nine were publicly whipped. In 1686, at <a href="Charborough%20House">Charborough Park</a>, a meeting took place to plot the downfall of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II of England</a>. This meeting was effectively the start of the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>.

During the 18th century, much <a href="smuggling">smuggling</a> took place along the Dorset coast; its coves, caves and sandy beaches provided opportunities for gangs such as the <a href="Hawkhurst%20Gang">Hawkhursts</a> to stealthily bring smuggled goods ashore. Poole became Dorset's busiest port and established prosperous trade links with the fisheries of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> which supported cloth, rope and net manufacturing industries in the surrounding towns and villages. However, the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a> largely bypassed Dorset which lacked coal resources and as a consequence the county remained predominantly agricultural. Farming has always been central to the economy of Dorset and the county became the birthplace of the modern <a href="trade%20union%20movement">trade union movement</a> when, in 1834, six farm labourers formed a union to protest against falling wages. The labourers, who are now known as the <a href="Tolpuddle%20Martyrs">Tolpuddle Martyrs</a>, were subsequently arrested for administering "unlawful oaths" and sentenced to transportation but they were pardoned following massive protests by the working classes.

The <a href="Dorsetshire%20Regiment">Dorsetshire Regiment</a> were the first British unit to face a <a href="Chemical%20weapons%20in%20World%20War%20I">gas attack</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> (1914–1918) and they sustained particularly heavy losses at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. In total some 4,500 Dorset servicemen died in the war and of the county's towns and villages, only one, <a href="Langton%20Herring">Langton Herring</a>, known as a <a href="Thankful%20Villages">Thankful Village</a>, had no residents killed. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> (1939–1945) Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>: beach landing exercises were carried out at <a href="Studland">Studland</a> and Weymouth and the village of <a href="Tyneham">Tyneham</a> was requisitioned for army training. Tens-of-thousands of troops departed Weymouth, Portland and Poole harbours during <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> and gliders from <a href="RAF%20Tarrant%20Rushton">RAF Tarrant Rushton</a> dropped troops near <a href="Caen">Caen</a> to begin <a href="Operation%20Tonga">Operation Tonga</a>. Dorset experienced an increase in holiday-makers after the war. First popularised as a tourist destination by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III's</a> frequent visits to Weymouth, the county's coastline, seaside resorts and its sparsely populated rural areas attract millions of visitors each year. With farming declining across the country, tourism has edged ahead as the primary revenue-earning sector.

Dorset is largely rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities. The only major urban area is the <a href="South%20East%20Dorset%20conurbation">South East Dorset conurbation</a>, which is situated at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the <a href="seaside%20resort">seaside resort</a> of Bournemouth, the historic port and <a href="borough">borough</a> of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and <a href="Ferndown">Ferndown</a> plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the conurbation, was established in the <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian era</a> when <a href="sea%20bathing">sea bathing</a> became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of <a href="Sandbanks">Sandbanks</a> which has some of the highest land values by area in the world.

The other two major settlements in the county are Dorchester, which has been the county town since at least 1305, and Weymouth, a major seaside resort since the 18th century. <a href="Blandford%20Forum">Blandford Forum</a>, <a href="Sherborne">Sherborne</a>, <a href="Gillingham%2C%20Dorset">Gillingham</a>, <a href="Shaftesbury">Shaftesbury</a> and <a href="Sturminster%20Newton">Sturminster Newton</a> are historic <a href="market%20town">market town</a>s which serve the farms and villages of the <a href="Blackmore%20Vale">Blackmore Vale</a> in north Dorset. <a href="Beaminster">Beaminster</a> and <a href="Bridport">Bridport</a> are situated in the west of the county; <a href="Verwood">Verwood</a> and the historic Saxon market towns of <a href="Wareham%2C%20Dorset">Wareham</a> and <a href="Wimborne%20Minster">Wimborne Minster</a> are located to the east. Lyme Regis and <a href="Swanage">Swanage</a> are small coastal towns popular with tourists. Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental <a href="new%20town">new town</a> of <a href="Poundbury">Poundbury</a> commissioned and co-designed by <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>. The suburb, which is expected to be fully completed by 2025, was designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of <a href="dormitory%20town">dormitory town</a>s and car-oriented development.

Dorset covers an area of and contains considerable variety in its underlying geology, which is partly responsible for the diversity of landscape. A large percentage (66%) of the county comprises either <a href="chalk">chalk</a>, <a href="clay">clay</a> or mixed <a href="sand">sand</a> and <a href="gravel">gravel</a>s. The remainder is less straightforward and includes <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland</a> and <a href="Purbeck%20Group">Purbeck stone</a>, other <a href="limestone">limestone</a>s, <a href="calcareous%20clay">calcareous clay</a>s and <a href="shale">shale</a>s.<ref name="Draper 136/137"> Draper (pp. 136–137)</ref> Portland and Purbeck stone are of national importance as a building material and for restoring some of Britain's most famous landmarks. Almost every type of rock known from the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a> to the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> epochs can be found in the county.
Dorset has a number of limestone ridges which are mostly covered in either arable fields or <a href="calcareous%20grassland">calcareous grassland</a> supporting sheep. These limestone areas include a wide band of <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> chalk which crosses the county as a range of hills from north-east to south-west, incorporating <a href="Cranborne%20Chase">Cranborne Chase</a> and the <a href="Dorset%20Downs">Dorset Downs</a>, and a narrow band running from south-west to south-east, incorporating the <a href="Purbeck%20Hills">Purbeck Hills</a>. Between the chalk hills are large, wide <a href="River%20valley">vales</a> and wide <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>s. These vales are dotted with small villages, farms and <a href="coppice">coppice</a>s, and include the <a href="Blackmore%20Vale">Blackmore Vale</a> (<a href="River%20Stour%2C%20Dorset">Stour valley</a>) and <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Dorset">Frome valley</a>. The Blackmore Vale is composed of older Jurassic deposits, largely clays interspersed with limestones, and has traditionally been a centre for dairy agriculture. South-east Dorset, including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth, comprises younger Eocene deposits, mainly sands and clays of poor agricultural quality. The soils created from these deposits support a <a href="heathland">heathland</a> habitat which sustains all six native <a href="List%20of%20reptiles%20of%20Great%20Britain">British reptile</a> species. Most of the Dorset heathland has <a href="SSSI">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) status with three areas designated as internationally important <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar sites</a>. In the far west of the county and along the coast there are frequent changes in rock strata, which appear in a less obviously sequential way compared to the landscapes of the chalk and the heath. In the west this results in a hilly landscape of diverse character that resembles that of neighbouring county <a href="Devon">Devon</a>. <a href="Marshwood%20Vale">Marshwood Vale</a>, a valley of <a href="Lower%20Lias">Lower Lias</a> clay at the western tip of the county, lies to the south of the two highest points in Dorset: <a href="Lewesdon%20Hill">Lewesdon Hill</a> at and <a href="Pilsdon%20Pen">Pilsdon Pen</a> at .

A former river valley flooded by rising sea levels 6,000 years ago, <a href="Poole%20Harbour">Poole Harbour</a> is one of the largest natural harbours in the world.
The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands, notably <a href="Brownsea%20Island">Brownsea Island</a>, the birthplace of the <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> movement and one of the few remaining sanctuaries for indigenous <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>s in England. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Purbeck">Isle of Purbeck</a> to the south, lie atop Western Europe's largest onshore <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a>. The field, operated by <a href="Perenco">Perenco</a> from <a href="Wytch%20Farm">Wytch Farm</a>, has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at <a href="Kimmeridge%20Oil%20Field">Kimmeridge</a> which has been producing oil since the early 1960s.

Dorset's diverse geography ensures it has an assortment of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically <a href="lowland">lowland</a> in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Dorset">Frome</a>, <a href="River%20Piddle">Piddle</a> and <a href="River%20Stour%2C%20Dorset">Stour</a> which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are <a href="chalk%20stream">chalk stream</a>s but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The <a href="Hampshire%20Avon">River Avon</a>, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset towards the end of its journey at <a href="Christchurch%20Harbour">Christchurch Harbour</a>. The rivers <a href="River%20Axe%20%28Lyme%20Bay%29">Axe</a> and <a href="River%20Yeo%20%28South%20Somerset%29">Yeo</a>, which principally drain the counties of Devon and <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the <a href="River%20Char">Char</a>, <a href="River%20Brit">Brit</a>, <a href="River%20Bride%2C%20Dorset">Bride</a> and <a href="River%20Wey%2C%20Dorset">Wey</a>.
Most of Dorset's coastline is part of the <a href="Jurassic%20Coast">Jurassic Coast</a>, a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, which stretches for between Studland and <a href="Exmouth">Exmouth</a> in Devon. This coast documents the entire <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era, from <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> to <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and is noted for its geological <a href="landform">landform</a>s. The Dorset section has yielded important fossils, including <a href="Petrified%20wood">Jurassic trees</a> and the first complete <a href="Ichthyosaur">Ichthyosaur</a>, discovered near <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> in 1811 by <a href="Mary%20Anning">Mary Anning</a>. The county features some notable coastal landforms, including examples of a <a href="cove">cove</a> (<a href="Lulworth%20Cove">Lulworth Cove</a>), a <a href="natural%20arch">natural arch</a> (<a href="Durdle%20Door">Durdle Door</a>) and chalk <a href="Stack%20%28geology%29">stacks</a> (<a href="Old%20Harry%20Rocks">Old Harry Rocks</a>). Jutting out into the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Isle of Portland</a>, a limestone island that is connected to the mainland by <a href="Chesil%20Beach">Chesil Beach</a>, a long <a href="Shingle%20beach">shingle</a> <a href="Shoal">barrier beach</a> protecting <a href="Chesil%20Beach%23The%20Fleet%20Lagoon">Britain's largest tidal lagoon</a>.

The county has one of the highest proportions of <a href="conservation%20area">conservation area</a>s in England—and two <a href="AONB">Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB) covering 53% of the administrative county. It has two <a href="Heritage%20Coast">Heritage Coast</a>s totalling and Sites of Special Scientific Interest covering . The <a href="South%20West%20Coast%20Path">South West Coast Path</a>, <a href="National%20Trail">National Trail</a>, begins at South Haven Point at the entrance to Poole Harbour. There are also substantial areas of <a href="Green%20belt%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">green belt</a> surrounding the <a href="South%20East%20Dorset%20conurbation">South East Dorset conurbation</a>, filling in the area between this and the <a href="Cranborne%20Chase">Cranborne Chase and the West Wiltshire Downs</a> AONB.

Dorset's climate of warm summers and mild winters is partly due to its position on Britain's south coast. The third most southerly county in the UK, Dorset is less affected by the more intense Atlantic winds than <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and Devon. Dorset, along with the entire south-west, has higher winter temperatures, average , than the rest of the United Kingdom. However, Dorset maintains higher summer temperatures than Devon and Cornwall, with average highs of . Excluding hills such as the Dorset Downs, the average annual temperature of the county is .

The south coast counties of Dorset, Hampshire, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>, East Sussex and <a href="Kent">Kent</a> enjoy more sunshine than anywhere else in the United Kingdom, receiving 1,541–1,885 hours a year. Average annual rainfall varies across the county—southern and eastern coastal areas receive per year; the Dorset Downs receive between per year; less than Devon and Cornwall to the west but more than counties to the east.

The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 Census</a> records Dorset's population as 744,041. This consisted of 412,905 for the <a href="non-metropolitan%20county">non-metropolitan county</a> (not including Bournemouth and Poole), 183,491 for the <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary authority</a> of Bournemouth and 147,645 for the unitary authority of Poole. In 2013 it was estimated that the population had risen by around 1.4% to 754,460: 416,720 in the non-metropolitan county and 188,730 and 149,010 in Bournemouth and Poole respectively. More than half of the county's residents live in the Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch conurbation.

Dorset's population has a high proportion of older people and a lower than average proportion of young people: According to 2013 mid-year estimates, 23.6% are over 65 years of age, higher than the <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> average of 17.4%, and 18.6% are less than 17 years old, lower than the England and Wales average of 21.3%. The working age population (females and males between 16 and 64) is lower than England and Wales average, 60% compared to 64%. Data collected between 2010 and 2012 shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is 85.3 years for females and 81.2 years for males. This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of 82.9 and 79.1 years respectively. Around 95.2% of Dorset's population are of white ethnicity, 60.9% of the population are <a href="Christianity%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Christian</a> and 28.5% say they are not religious.

More than 33% of the county's population possess a level 4 qualification or above, such as a Higher National Diploma, Degree or a Higher Degree; while nearly 6.3% have no qualifications at all. Almost 43.7% are employed in a professional or technical capacity (Standard Occupational Classification 2010, groups 1–3), just over 10.3% are administrators or secretaries (group 4), around 12.8% have a skilled trade (group 5), over 18% are employed at a low-level in the care, leisure, sales or customer relations sector (groups 6 and 7) and 14.8% are operatives or in elementary occupations (groups 8 and 9).

<a href="Local%20government%20in%20England">Local government</a> in Dorset consists of a <a href="county%20council">county council</a> (<a href="Dorset%20County%20Council">Dorset County Council</a>) and two unitary authorities (<a href="Bournemouth%20Borough%20Council">Bournemouth Borough Council</a> and <a href="Poole%20Borough%20Council">Poole Borough Council</a>). Dorset County Council was created by the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201888">Local Government Act 1888</a> to govern the newly created <a href="Administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of Dorset which was based largely on the <a href="Ancient%20counties%20of%20England">historic county</a> borders. Dorset became a two-tier non-metropolitan county after a <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">reorganisation of local government in 1974</a> and its border was extended eastwards to incorporate the former Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Following a review by the <a href="Local%20Government%20Commission%20for%20England%20%281992%29">Local Government Commission for England</a>, Bournemouth and Poole each became administratively independent single-tier unitary authorities in 1997, although they remain part of the county geographically and for ceremonial purposes. The county council is based in Dorchester and comprises six-second-tier <a href="Non-metropolitan%20district">districts</a>: <a href="West%20Dorset">West Dorset</a>, <a href="East%20Dorset">East Dorset</a>, <a href="North%20Dorset">North Dorset</a>, <a href="Purbeck%20%28district%29">Purbeck</a>, Christchurch, and <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland">Weymouth and Portland</a>. The council is controlled by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>: at the <a href="Dorset%20County%20Council%20election%2C%202017">2017 local elections</a> 32 Conservative, 11 <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a>, 1 <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> and 2 Green Party county councillors were elected. The Conservatives also have control of Bournemouth and Poole. At the Bournemouth Council election in 2015: 51 Conservative, one Green Party, one <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UK Independence Party</a> and one independent councillors were elected. As of 2015 Poole council comprises 32 Conservative councillors, six Liberal Democrat, three Poole People (a political party of Poole residents) and one <a href="UKIP">UKIP</a>.
Statutory Instruments for local government reorganisation in the ceremonial county of Dorset were made in May 2018. Under the plans, dubbed "Future Dorset", all existing councils within the county will be abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities. One will be formed from the existing unitary authorities of <a href="Bournemouth%20Borough%20Council">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="Poole%20Borough%20Council">Poole</a> which will merge with the non-metropolitan district of <a href="Christchurch%2C%20Dorset">Christchurch</a> to create a unitary authority to be known as <a href="Bournemouth%2C%20Christchurch%20and%20Poole%20Council">Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council</a>. The other will be created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland">Weymouth and Portland</a>, <a href="West%20Dorset">West Dorset</a>, <a href="North%20Dorset">North Dorset</a>, <a href="Purbeck%20District">Purbeck</a> and <a href="East%20Dorset">East Dorset</a> and will be known as <a href="Dorset%20%28unitary%20authority%29">Dorset</a>. The two new authorities will come into being on 1 April 2019.

For representation in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> Dorset is divided into eight Parliamentary constituencies—five <a href="county%20constituencies">county constituencies</a> and three <a href="borough%20constituencies">borough constituencies</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202017">2017 general election</a>, the Conservative Party was dominant, taking all eight seats. The borough constituencies of <a href="Bournemouth%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bournemouth East</a>, <a href="Bournemouth%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bournemouth West</a> and <a href="Poole%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Poole</a> are traditionally Conservative <a href="safe%20seat">safe seat</a>s and are all represented by Conservative members of parliament. The county constituencies of <a href="North%20Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Dorset</a> and <a href="Christchurch%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Christchurch</a> are also represented by Conservative MPs. <a href="West%20Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Dorset</a> is represented by Conservative MP <a href="Oliver%20Letwin">Oliver Letwin</a> who was the <a href="Cabinet%20Office">Minister of State at the Cabinet Office</a> in David Cameron's government. The marginal seat of <a href="South%20Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South Dorset</a> is represented by <a href="Richard%20Drax">Richard Drax</a>, who gained the seat from Labour representative, <a href="Jim%20Knight">Jim Knight</a>, in 2010. Drax retained the seat in 2015 and 2017. The <a href="Mid%20Dorset%20and%20North%20Poole%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Mid Dorset and North Poole</a> constituency has been represented by the Conservative MP, <a href="Michael%20Tomlinson">Michael Tomlinson</a> since 2015. For the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> the county lies within the <a href="South%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South West England</a> constituency which elected two Conservative, two <a href="UKIP">UKIP</a>, one Labour and one Green Party <a href="Members%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Members of the European Parliament</a> (MEPs) at the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202014%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2014 European Parliament election</a>.

In 2003 the <a href="gross%20value%20added">gross value added</a> (GVA) for the non-metropolitan county was £4,673 million, with an additional £4,705 million for Poole and Bournemouth. <a href="Primary%20industry">Primary industry</a> produced 2.03% of GVA, <a href="secondary%20industry">secondary industry</a> produced 22.44% and 75.53% came from <a href="tertiary%20industry">tertiary industry</a>. The average GVA for the 16 regions of <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> was £4,693 million.

The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture. It has not, however, been the largest employer since the mid 19th century as <a href="mechanisation">mechanisation</a> substantially reduced the number of workers required. Agriculture has become less profitable and the industry has declined further. Within the administrative county between 1995 and 2003, GVA for primary industry (largely agriculture, fishing and quarrying) declined from £229 million to £188 million—7.1% to 4.0%. In 2007, of the county was in agricultural use, up from in 1989, although this was due to an increase in permanent grass, and land <a href="set%20aside">set aside</a>. By contrast, in the same period, <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> decreased from . Excluding fowl, sheep are the most common animal stock in the county; between 1989 and 2006 their numbers fell from 252,189 to 193,500. Cattle and pig farming has declined similarly; during the same period the number of cattle fell from 240,413 to 170,700, and pigs from 169,636 to 72,700.

In 2009 there were 2,340 armed forces personnel stationed in Dorset including the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a> at <a href="Bovington%20Camp">Bovington</a>, <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Signals</a> at <a href="Blandford%20Camp">Blandford</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> at <a href="RM%20Poole">Poole</a>. The military presence has had a mixed effect on the local economy, bringing additional employment for civilians, but on occasion having a negative impact on the tourist trade, particularly when popular areas are closed for military manoeuvres. Plans to relocate the <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Signals">Royal School of Signals</a> from Blandford to South Wales could result in a loss of up to £74 million GVA for the area.

Other major employers in the county include: <a href="BAE%20Systems">BAE Systems</a>, <a href="Sunseeker%20International">Sunseeker International</a>, <a href="J.P.%20Morgan%20Chase">J.P. Morgan</a>, <a href="Cobham%20plc">Cobham plc</a> and <a href="Bournemouth%20University">Bournemouth University</a>. Dorset's three ports, <a href="Poole%20Harbour">Poole</a>, <a href="Weymouth%20Harbour%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> and <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland</a>, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate a substantial amount of international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympic Games</a>, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to have a positive effect on local businesses and tourism.

Tourism has grown in Dorset since the late 18th century and is now the predominant industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2 million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6 million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458 million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.

Manufacturing industry in Dorset provided 10.3% of employment in 2008. This was slightly above the average for Great Britain but below that of the South West region which was at 10.7% for that period. The sector is the county's fourth largest employer, but a predicted decline suggests there will be 10,200 fewer jobs in manufacturing by 2026.

As a largely rural county, Dorset has fewer major cultural institutions than larger or more densely populated areas. Major venues for concerts and theatre include Poole's <a href="The%20Lighthouse%20%28Poole%29">Lighthouse</a> arts centre, Bournemouth's <a href="Bournemouth%20International%20Centre">BIC</a>, <a href="Pavilion%20Theatre%20%28Bournemouth%29">Pavilion Theatre</a> and <a href="O2%20Academy%20Bournemouth">O2 Academy</a>, and the <a href="Weymouth%20Pavilion">Pavilion</a> theatre in Weymouth. One of Dorset's most noted cultural institutions is the <a href="Bournemouth%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra</a> which was founded in 1893. Based in Poole, the orchestra performs over 130 concerts across southern England each year.

Dorset has more than 30 general and specialist museums. The <a href="Dorset%20County%20Museum">Dorset County Museum</a> in Dorchester was founded in 1846 and contains an extensive collection of exhibits covering the county's history and environment. <a href="The%20Tank%20Museum">The Tank Museum</a> at <a href="Bovington">Bovington</a> contains more than 300 tanks and armoured vehicles from 30 nations. The museum is the largest in Dorset and its collection has been <a href="Designation%20Scheme">designated of national importance</a>. Other museums which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include <a href="The%20Keep%2C%20Dorchester">The Keep Military Museum</a> in Dorchester, the <a href="Russell-Cotes%20Museum">Russell-Cotes Museum</a> in Bournemouth, the <a href="Charmouth%20Heritage%20Coast%20Centre">Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre</a>, <a href="Poole%20Museum">Poole Museum</a>, <a href="Portland%20Museum%2C%20Dorset">Portland Museum</a> and <a href="Wareham%20Town%20Museum">Wareham Town Museum</a>.

Dorset contains 190 <a href="conservation%20area%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">conservation area</a>s, more than 1,500 <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a>s, over 30 registered parks and gardens and 12,850 <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>s. Grade I listed buildings include: <a href="Portland%20Castle">Portland Castle</a>, a coastal fort commissioned by <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>; a <a href="Corfe%20Castle">castle</a> with more than a 1,000 years of history at <a href="Corfe%20Castle">Corfe</a>; a <a href="Roman%20Town%20House%2C%20Dorchester">Roman ruin</a> described by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> as the "only Roman town house visible in Britain"; <a href="Athelhampton">Athelhampton</a>, a <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor</a> manor house; <a href="Forde%20Abbey">Forde Abbey</a>, a stately home and former <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> monastery; <a href="Christchurch%20Priory">Christchurch Priory</a>, the longest church in England; and <a href="St%20Edwold%27s%20Church%2C%20Stockwood">St Edwold's church</a>, one of the smallest.
Dorset hosts a number of annual festivals, fairs and events including the <a href="Great%20Dorset%20Steam%20Fair">Great Dorset Steam Fair</a> near Blandford, one of the largest events of its kind in Europe, and the <a href="Bournemouth%20Air%20Festival">Bournemouth Air Festival</a>, a free <a href="air%20show">air show</a> that attracted 1.3 million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and <a href="Wimborne%20Folk%20Festival">Wimborne</a>, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as <a href="Camp%20Bestival">Camp Bestival</a>, <a href="End%20Of%20The%20Road%20Festival">End of the Road</a> and the <a href="Larmer%20Tree%20Festival">Larmer Tree Festival</a>.

Dorset's only professional football club is <a href="A.F.C.%20Bournemouth">A.F.C.

The county's coastline, on the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, is noted for its watersports (particularly sailing, <a href="gig%20racing">gig racing</a>, windsurfing, power boating and kayaking) which take advantage of the sheltered waters in the bays of <a href="Weymouth%20Bay">Weymouth</a> and <a href="Poole%20Bay">Poole</a>, and the harbours of Poole and Portland. Dorset hosted the sailing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics at the <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland%20National%20Sailing%20Academy">Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy</a>. The venue was completed in May 2009 and was used by international sailing teams in preparation for the Games.
Dorset is famed in literature for being the native county of author and poet <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, and many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional <a href="Thomas%20Hardy%27s%20Wessex">Wessex</a> are in Dorset, which he renamed "South Wessex". The <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> owns <a href="Thomas%20Hardy%27s%20Cottage">Thomas Hardy's Cottage</a>, in Higher Bockhampton, east of Dorchester; and <a href="Max%20Gate">Max Gate</a>, his former house in Dorchester. Several other writers have called Dorset home, including <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a>, who wrote much of "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" while he lived in <a href="Stalbridge">Stalbridge</a>; <a href="John%20le%20Carr%C3%A9">John le Carré</a>, author of espionage novels, was born in Poole; <a href="Tom%20Sharpe">Tom Sharpe</a> of "<a href="Wilt%20%28novel%29">Wilt</a>" fame lived in Bridport; <a href="John%20Fowles">John Fowles</a> ("<a href="The%20French%20Lieutenant%27s%20Woman">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>") lived in Lyme Regis before he died in late 2005; <a href="T.F.%20Powys">T.F. Powys</a> lived in <a href="Chaldon%20Herring">Chaldon Herring</a> for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel "<a href="Mr.%20Weston%27s%20Good%20Wine">Mr. Weston's Good Wine</a>"; <a href="John%20Cowper%20Powys">John Cowper Powys</a>, his elder brother, also set a number of his works in Dorset, such as the novels "<a href="Maiden%20Castle%20%28novel%29">Maiden Castle</a>" and "<a href="Weymouth%20Sands">Weymouth Sands</a>". The 19th-century poet <a href="William%20Barnes">William Barnes</a> was born in <a href="Bagber">Bagber</a> and wrote many poems in his native <a href="West%20Country%20dialect">Dorset dialect</a>. Originating from the ancient <a href="Proto-Norse%20language">Norse</a> and <a href="Old%20Saxon">Saxon</a> languages, the dialect was prevalent across the Blackmore Vale but has fallen into disuse.

<a href="Flag%20of%20Dorset">Dorset's flag</a>, which is known as the Dorset Cross or St Wite's Cross, was adopted in 2008 following a public competition organised by Dorset County Council. The winning design, which features a white cross with a red border on a golden background, attracted 54% of the vote. All three colours are used in Dorset County Council's coat of arms and the red and white was used in recognition of the <a href="Flag%20of%20England">English flag</a>. The golden colour represents Dorset's sandy beaches and the Dorset landmarks of <a href="Golden%20Cap">Golden Cap</a> and <a href="Gold%20Hill%2C%20Shaftesbury">Gold Hill</a>. It is also a reference to the <a href="Wessex%23Wyvern%20or%20dragon">Wessex Dragon</a>, a symbol of the <a href="Wessex">Saxon Kingdom</a> which Dorset once belonged to, and the gold wreath featured on the badge of the <a href="Dorset%20Regiment">Dorset Regiment</a>.

Dorset is connected to London by two main line railways. The <a href="West%20of%20England%20Main%20Line">West of England Main Line</a> runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne. Running west from <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">London Waterloo</a> to <a href="Exeter%20St%20Davids%20railway%20station">Exeter St Davids</a> in Devon, it provides a service for those who live in the western districts of Dorset. The <a href="South%20Western%20Main%20Line">South Western Main Line</a> runs through the south at Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth. Additionally, the <a href="Heart%20of%20Wessex%20Line">Heart of Wessex Line</a> runs north from Weymouth to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and the <a href="Swanage%20Railway">Swanage Railway</a>, a <a href="Heritage%20railway">heritage steam and diesel railway</a>, runs the between <a href="Norden%20railway%20station%20%28Dorset%29">Norden</a> and Swanage.

Dorset is one of the few counties in England not to have a motorway. The <a href="A303%20road">A303</a>, <a href="A35%20road">A35</a> and <a href="A31%20road">A31</a> <a href="trunk%20road">trunk road</a>s run through the county. The A303, which connects the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> to London via the <a href="M3%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">M3</a>, clips the north-west of the county. The A35 crosses the county in a west–east direction from <a href="Honiton">Honiton</a> in Devon, via Bridport, Dorchester, Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch, to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> in Hampshire. The A31 connects to the A35 at <a href="Bere%20Regis">Bere Regis</a>, and passes east through Wimborne and Ferndown to Hampshire, where it later becomes the <a href="M27%20motorway%20%28England%29">M27</a>. Other main roads in the county include the <a href="A338">A338</a>, <a href="A354">A354</a>, <a href="A37%20road%20%28England%29">A37</a> and <a href="A350%20road">A350</a>. The A338 heads north from Bournemouth to <a href="Ringwood">Ringwood</a> (Hampshire) and on to <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> (Wiltshire) and beyond. The A354 also connects to Salisbury after travelling north-east from Weymouth in the south of the county. The A37 travels north-west from Dorchester to <a href="Yeovil">Yeovil</a> in Somerset. The A350 also leads north, from Poole through <a href="Blandford">Blandford</a> and <a href="Shaftesbury">Shaftesbury</a>, to <a href="Warminster">Warminster</a> in Wiltshire.

Two passenger sea ports and an international airport are situated in the county. <a href="Brittany%20Ferries">Brittany Ferries</a> and <a href="Condor%20Ferries">Condor Ferries</a>, operate out of Poole Harbour; Brittany Ferries provide access to <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> in France and Condor Ferries sail a seasonal service to the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> and <a href="St%20Malo">St Malo</a>, France. Condor Ferries operated services from Weymouth harbour to Guernsey, Jersey and St. Malo throughout the year however, these ceased in 2015.<a href="https%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-32013883"></a> Poole, since the dredging of the main channel in 2008, and Portland harbours are capable of taking cruise liners. <a href="Bournemouth%20Airport">Bournemouth Airport</a>, which is situated on the edge of <a href="Hurn">Hurn</a> village north of Bournemouth, has flights to 36 destinations and serves some 600,000 passengers a year. In August 2007 work began on a £32 million expansion programme which includes enlargement of the terminal building and an increase in parking.

Dorset is served by 14 commercial bus operators. <a href="Go%20South%20Coast">morebus</a> and <a href="Go%20South%20Coast">Damory</a> share a county wide network with frequent services linking major towns, including Bournemouth, Poole and Wimborne, and a varied service in further rural locations. The <a href="First%20Hampshire%20%26amp%3B%20Dorset">First Group</a> operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area, including: a regular route along the A35 from Weymouth to Axminster, which helps to compensate for the missing rail link west of Dorchester; and the Jurassic Coast service, one of the longest bus routes in the UK, which provides through travel from Poole to Exeter, exploiting a popular tourist route. <a href="Yellow%20Buses">Yellow Buses</a> provide some bus services within Bournemouth and outlying areas.

Unlike all of its neighbouring counties, Dorset does not have a cathedral. Over 95% of the county falls within the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> <a href="Diocese%20of%20Salisbury">Diocese of Salisbury</a>. A small section to the west comes under the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Diocese of Bath and Wells</a> and to the east Christchurch and much of Bournemouth—both historically part of Hampshire—belong to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Diocese of Winchester</a>. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Plymouth">Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth</a> incorporates most of Dorset with the exception of Christchurch and a portion of Bournemouth which belongs to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Portsmouth">Diocese of Portsmouth</a>. Few purpose-built places of worship exist in Dorset for faiths other than Christianity. In 2008 a Hindu temple was constructed in Blandford Forum for the <a href="Queen%27s%20Gurkha%20Signals">Gurkhas</a> based at the town's military camp. Bournemouth, which contains a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average, has two synagogues.

Christianity was introduced to Dorset by the Romans. A 4th century <a href="Hinton%20St%20Mary%20Mosaic">Roman mosaic</a> discovered near <a href="Hinton%20St%20Mary">Hinton St Mary</a> contains what is generally accepted to be an image of Christ. Christianity became firmly established in the county during the Saxon period although there are few surviving Saxon churches; the most complete is <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Wareham">St. Martin's</a> in Wareham which has features from the early 11th century. Mediaeval churches are more prevalent in Dorset; most are 15th century and are of a <a href="Perpendicular%20Gothic">Perpendicular</a> style. <a href="Sherborne%20Abbey">Sherborne Abbey</a>, one of the county's largest, is noted for its broad <a href="fan%20vault">fan vault</a>ing added during an extensive 15th century rebuild. Founded in AD 705 by <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, the Abbey contained the <a href="Cathedra">chair</a> of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne">Bishop of Sherborne</a> and was granted cathedral status until 1075 when the diocese was transferred to <a href="Old%20Sarum">Old Sarum</a>. <a href="Wimborne%20Minster%20%28church%29">Wimborne Minster</a> features a <a href="chained%20library">chained library</a> and a 14th-century <a href="astronomical%20clock">astronomical clock</a>; <a href="Christchurch%20Priory">Christchurch Priory</a> is renowned for its <a href="Christchurch%20Priory%23Miraculous%20beam">miraculous beam</a> which, according to legend, was installed by Christ; and the 15th century roof spanning the <a href="nave">nave</a> at St John the Baptist Church in Bere Regis is described by architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as the "finest timber roof of Dorset". <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Candida%20and%20Holy%20Cross">St Candida and Holy Cross</a> at <a href="Whitchurch%20Canonicorum">Whitchurch Canonicorum</a> is the only church in the country, besides <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, to have a shrine that contains the <a href="relic">relic</a>s of a saint.

Monastic foundations were once abundant in Dorset, but all ceased to exist at the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">Dissolution</a>. The <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation</a> and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the 18th century. Notable examples of <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Early Georgian</a> churches include the <a href="Bastard%20brothers">Bastard brothers</a>' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and <a href="St%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Portland">St George's Church</a> on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in <a href="East%20Lulworth">East Lulworth</a>—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Bournemouth">St Peter's</a> and <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Church%2C%20Bournemouth">St Stephen's</a>. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of <a href="Edward%20Schroeder%20Prior">Edward Schroeder Prior</a>, it is one of the last examples of the <a href="Byzantine%20Revival%20architecture">Neo Byzantine style</a>. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in <a href="Moreton%2C%20Dorset">Moreton</a> is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by <a href="Laurence%20Whistler">Laurence Whistler</a>. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.

Responsibility for <a href="state%20school">state school</a>s in Dorset is divided between three <a href="local%20education%20authority">local education authorities</a>: Dorset County Council, which covers the majority of the county, and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities. Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two-tier <a href="Comprehensive%20school">comprehensive system</a> whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school but Corfe Mullen, Dorchester, Ferndown and <a href="West%20Moors">West Moors</a> maintain a <a href="Three-tier%20education">three-tier system</a> (<a href="first%20school">first</a>, <a href="middle%20school">middle</a> and high school). Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates two and three-tier systems. Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education, each containing two <a href="Single-sex%20education">single-sex</a> <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>s which select pupils on the basis of an <a href="eleven-plus">eleven-plus</a> examination. Some of the county's schools are <a href="Academy%20%28English%20school%29">academies</a>—self-governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the <a href="Department%20for%20Education">Department for Education</a>. In 2017, the <a href="Progress%208%20benchmark">Progress 8 score</a> for schools in the county council area was ranked below average, and 39.6% of pupils gained at least Grade 5 or above in English and maths <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s matching the national average of 39.6%. Poole recorded an above average Progress 8 score and 54% of pupils achieved Grade 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs. Bournemouth was ranked as average and 47.8% of pupils achieved Grade 5 or above in English and maths <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s.

Dorset contains a range of privately funded independent schools. Many are <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>s which also take <a href="Day%20school">day pupils</a>, such as the co-educational <a href="Canford%20School">Canford School</a> which is built around a 19th-century Grade I listed <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a>; <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20School%2C%20Shaftesbury">St Mary's</a>, a Catholic girls' school in Shaftesbury; and <a href="Sherborne%20School">Sherborne School</a>, a boys school founded in the 16th century.

Four of the county's five largest towns contain a <a href="further%20education">further education</a> college: <a href="Weymouth%20College">Weymouth College</a>, <a href="Kingston%20Maurward%20College">Kingston Maurward College</a> in Dorchester and <a href="Bournemouth%20and%20Poole%20College">Bournemouth and Poole College</a> which is one of the largest in the UK. Dorset has two higher education establishments situated in the heart of the county's south east conurbation. <a href="Bournemouth%20University">Bournemouth University</a> has facilities across Bournemouth and Poole and over 17,000 students. Previously named Bournemouth Polytechnic, it was granted university status as a result of the <a href="Further%20and%20Higher%20Education%20Act%201992">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>. <a href="The%20Arts%20University%20Bournemouth">The Arts University Bournemouth</a> is situated between the border of Poole and Bournemouth. It became a higher education institute in 2001 and was given degree-awarding powers in 2008. It was granted full university status in 2012.

Isis

Isis was a major <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">goddess</a> in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a> whose worship spread throughout the <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>. Isis was first mentioned in the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686–2181 BCE) as one of the main characters of the <a href="Osiris%20myth">Osiris myth</a>, in which she resurrects her slain husband, the divine king <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, and produces and protects his heir, <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. She was believed to help the dead enter the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife</a> as she had helped Osiris, and she was considered the divine mother of the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, who was likened to Horus. Her <a href="maternal">maternal</a> aid was invoked in healing <a href="Spell%20%28paranormal%29">spells</a> to benefit ordinary people. Originally, she played a limited role in royal rituals and <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temple</a> rites, although she was more prominent in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">funerary practices</a> and magical texts. She was usually portrayed in art as a human woman wearing a throne-like <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyph</a> on her head. During the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BCE), as she took on traits that originally belonged to <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>, the preeminent goddess of earlier times, Isis came to be portrayed wearing Hathor's headdress: a sun disk between the horns of a cow.

In the first millennium BCE, Osiris and Isis became the most widely worshipped of Egyptian deities, and Isis absorbed traits from many other goddesses. Rulers in Egypt and its neighbor to the south, <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, began to build temples dedicated primarily to Isis, and her temple at <a href="Philae">Philae</a> was a religious center for Egyptians and Nubians alike. Isis's reputed <a href="heku">magical power</a> was greater than that of all other gods, and she was said to protect the kingdom from its enemies, govern the skies and the natural world, and have power over <a href="fate">fate</a> itself.

In the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> (323–30 BCE), when Egypt was ruled and settled by <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>, Isis came to be worshipped by Greeks and Egyptians, along with a new god, <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a>. Their worship diffused into the wider Mediterranean world. Isis's Greek devotees ascribed to her traits taken from <a href="Greek%20deities">Greek deities</a>, such as the invention of marriage and the protection of ships at sea, and she retained strong links with Egypt and other Egyptian deities who were popular in the Hellenistic world, such as Osiris and <a href="Harpocrates">Harpocrates</a>. As Hellenistic culture was absorbed by <a href="ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> in the first century BCE, the <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> of Isis became a part of <a href="religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman religion</a>. Her devotees were a small proportion of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>'s population but were found all across its territory. Her following developed distinctive <a href="Roman%20festival">festivals</a> such as the <a href="Navigium%20Isidis">Navigium Isidis</a>, as well as <a href="mysteries%20of%20Isis">initiation ceremonies</a> resembling those of other <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">Greco-Roman mystery cults</a>. Some of her devotees said she encompassed all feminine divine powers in the world.

The worship of Isis was ended by the rise of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Her worship may have influenced Christian beliefs and practices such as the <a href="veneration%20of%20Mary">veneration of Mary</a>, but the evidence for this influence is ambiguous and often controversial. Isis continues to appear in <a href="Western%20culture">Western culture</a>, particularly in <a href="Western%20esotericism">esotericism</a> and <a href="modern%20paganism">modern paganism</a>, often as a <a href="Veil%20of%20Isis">personification of nature</a> or the feminine aspect of divinity.

Whereas some <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">Egyptian deities</a> appeared in the late <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic Period</a> (before c. 3100 BCE), neither Isis nor her husband <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> were clearly mentioned before the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> (c. 2494–2345 BCE). An inscription that may refer to Isis dates to the reign of <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a> during that period, and she appears prominently in the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>", which began to be written down at the end of the dynasty and whose content may have developed much earlier. Several passages in the "Pyramid Texts" link Isis with the region of the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> near <a href="Behbeit%20el-Hagar">Behbeit el-Hagar</a> and <a href="Sebennytos">Sebennytos</a>, and her <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> may have originated there.

Many scholars have focused on Isis's name in trying to determine her origins. Her <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> name was "ꜣst", which became ("Ēse") in the <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic form of Egyptian</a>, "Wusa" in the <a href="Meroitic%20language">Meroitic language</a> of Nubia, and Ἶσις ("Isis"; ), on which her modern name is based, in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a>. The <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic</a> writing of her name incorporates the sign for a throne, which Isis also wears on her head as a sign of her identity. The symbol serves as a <a href="phonogram%20%28linguistics%29">phonogram</a>, spelling the "st" sounds in her name, but it may have also represented a link with actual thrones. The Egyptian term for a throne was also "st" and may have shared a common <a href="etymology">etymology</a> with Isis's name. Therefore, the Egyptologist <a href="Kurt%20Sethe">Kurt Sethe</a> suggested she was originally a personification of thrones. <a href="Henri%20Frankfort">Henri Frankfort</a> agreed, believing that the throne was considered the king's mother, and thus a goddess, because of its power to make a man into a king. Other scholars, such as Jürgen Osing and Klaus P. Kuhlmann, have disputed this interpretation, because of dissimilarities between Isis's name and the word for a throne or a lack of evidence that the throne was ever deified.

The <a href="Osiris%20myth">cycle of myth surrounding Osiris's death and resurrection</a> was first recorded in the "Pyramid Texts" and grew into the most elaborate and influential of all <a href="Egyptian%20myths">Egyptian myths</a>. Isis plays a more active role in this myth than the other protagonists, so as it developed in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">literature</a> from the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BCE) to the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Period">Ptolemaic Period</a> (305–30 BCE), she became the most complex literary character of all Egyptian deities. At the same time, she absorbed characteristics from many other goddesses, broadening her significance well beyond the Osiris myth.

Isis is part of the <a href="Ennead%20of%20Heliopolis">Ennead of Heliopolis</a>, a family of nine gods descended from the creator god, <a href="Atum">Atum</a> or <a href="Ra">Ra</a>. She and her siblings—Osiris, <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Set</a>, and <a href="Nephthys">Nephthys</a>—are the last generation of the Ennead, born to <a href="Geb">Geb</a>, god of the earth, and <a href="Nut%20%28goddess%29">Nut</a>, goddess of the sky. The creator god, the world's original ruler, passes down his authority through the male generations of the Ennead, so that Osiris becomes king. Isis, who is Osiris's <a href="Sibling_relationship%23Sibling_marriage_and_incest">wife as well as his sister</a>, is his queen.

Set kills Osiris and, in several versions of the story, dismembers his corpse. Isis and Nephthys, along with other deities such as <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, search for the pieces of their brother's body and reassemble it. Their efforts are the mythic prototype for <a href="mummification">mummification</a> and other <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20practices">ancient Egyptian funerary practices</a>. According to some texts, they must also protect Osiris's body from further desecration by Set or his servants. Isis is the epitome of a mourning widow. Her and Nephthys's love and grief for their brother help restore him to life, as does Isis's recitation of <a href="Spell%20%28paranormal%29">magical spells</a>. <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">Funerary texts</a> contain speeches by Isis in which she expresses her sorrow at Osiris's death, her sexual desire for him, and even anger that he has left her. All these emotions play a part in his revival, as they are meant to stir him into action. Finally, Isis restores breath and life to Osiris's body and copulates with him, conceiving their son, <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. From this point Osiris lives on only in the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>, or underworld. But by producing a son and heir to avenge his death and carry out funerary rites for him, Isis has ensured that her husband will endure in the afterlife.

Isis's role in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife beliefs</a> was based on that in the myth. She helped to restore the souls of deceased humans to wholeness as she had done for Osiris. Like other goddesses, such as <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>, she also acted as a mother to the deceased, providing protection and nourishment. Thus, like Hathor, she sometimes took the form of <a href="Imentet">Imentet</a>, the goddess of the west, who welcomed the deceased soul into the afterlife as her child. But for much of Egyptian history, male deities like Osiris were believed to provide the regenerative powers, including sexual potency, that were crucial for rebirth. Isis was thought to merely assist by stimulating this power. Feminine divine powers became more important in afterlife beliefs in the late New Kingdom. Various Ptolemaic funerary texts emphasize that Isis took the active role in Horus's conception by sexually stimulating her inert husband, some tomb decoration from the <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman period in Egypt</a> depicts Isis in a central role in the afterlife, and a funerary text from that era suggests that women were thought able to join the retinue of Isis and Nephthys in the afterlife.

Isis is treated as the mother of Horus even in the earliest copies of the "Pyramid Texts". Yet there are signs that Hathor was originally regarded as his mother, and other traditions make an elder form of Horus the son of Nut and a sibling of Isis and Osiris. Isis may only have come to be Horus's mother as the Osiris myth took shape during the Old Kingdom, but through her relationship with him she came to be seen as the epitome of maternal devotion.

In the developed form of the myth, Isis gives birth to Horus, after a long pregnancy and a difficult labor, in the <a href="Cyperus%20papyrus">papyrus</a> thickets of the Nile Delta. As her child grows she must protect him from Set and many other hazards—snakes, scorpions, and simple illness. In some texts, Isis travels among humans and must seek their help. According to one such story, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard her. They take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for the goddess to heal the blameless child. Isis's reputation as a compassionate deity, willing to relieve human suffering, contributed greatly to her appeal.

Isis continues to assist her son when he challenges Set to claim the kingship that Set has usurped, although mother and son are sometimes portrayed in conflict, as when Horus beheads Isis and she replaces her original head with that of a cow—an <a href="origin%20myth">origin myth</a> for the cow-horn headdress that Isis wears.

Isis's maternal aspect extended to other deities as well. The "<a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>" from the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055–1650 BCE) say the <a href="Four%20Sons%20of%20Horus">Four Sons of Horus</a>, funerary deities who were thought to protect the internal organs of the deceased, were the offspring of Isis and the elder form of Horus. In the same era, Horus was syncretized with the <a href="list%20of%20fertility%20deities">fertility god</a> <a href="Min%20%28god%29">Min</a>, so Isis was regarded as Min's mother. A form of Min known as Kamutef, "bull of his mother", who represented the cyclical regeneration of the gods and of kingship, was said to impregnate his mother to engender himself. Thus, Isis was also regarded as Min's consort. The same ideology of kingship may lie behind a tradition, found in a few texts, that Horus raped Isis. <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, the foremost Egyptian deity during the Middle and New Kingdoms, also took on the role of Kamutef, and when he was in this form, Isis often acted as his consort. <a href="Apis%20%28god%29">Apis</a>, a bull that was worshipped as a living god at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, was said to be Isis's son, fathered by a form of Osiris known as Osiris-Apis. The mother of each Apis bull was thus known as the "Isis cow".

A story in the <a href="Westcar%20Papyrus">Westcar Papyrus</a> from the Middle Kingdom includes Isis among a group of goddesses who serve as midwives during the delivery of three future kings. She serves a similar role in New Kingdom texts that describe the divinely ordained births of reigning pharaohs.

In the Westcar Papyrus, Isis calls out the names of the three children as they are born. Barbara S. Lesko sees this story as a sign that Isis had the power to predict or influence future events, like other deities who presided over birth, such as <a href="Shai">Shai</a> and <a href="Renenutet">Renenutet</a>. Texts from much later times explicitly call Isis "mistress of life, ruler of fate and destiny" and indicate she has control over Shai and Renenutet, just as other great gods like Amun were said to do in earlier eras of Egyptian history. By governing these deities, Isis determined the length and quality of human lives.

Horus was equated with each living pharaoh and Osiris with the pharaoh's deceased predecessors. Isis was therefore the mythological mother and wife of kings. In the "Pyramid Texts" her primary importance to the king was as one of the deities who protected and assisted him in the afterlife. Her prominence in royal ideology grew in the New Kingdom. Temple reliefs from that time on show the king nursing at Isis's breast; her milk not only healed her child but symbolized his divine right to rule. Royal ideology increasingly emphasized the importance of queens as earthly counterparts of the goddesses who served as wives to the pharaoh and mothers to his heirs. Initially the most important of these goddesses was Hathor, a feminine counterpart of Ra and Horus, whose attributes in art were incorporated into queens' crowns. But because of her own mythological links with queenship, Isis too was given the same titles and regalia as human queens.

Isis's actions in protecting Osiris against Set became part of a larger, more warlike aspect of her character. New Kingdom funerary texts portray Isis in the barque of Ra as he sails through the underworld, acting as one of several deities who subdue Ra's archenemy, <a href="Apep">Apep</a>. Kings also called upon her <a href="apotropaic">protective magical power</a> against human enemies. In her Ptolemaic temple at <a href="Philae">Philae</a>, which lay near the frontier with <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>n peoples who raided Egypt, she was described as the protectress of the entire nation, more effective in battle than "millions of soldiers", supporting Ptolemaic kings and Roman emperors in their efforts to subdue Egypt's enemies.

Isis was also known for her <a href="heku">magical power</a>, which enabled her to revive Osiris and to protect and heal Horus, and for her cunning. By virtue of her magical knowledge, she was said to be "more clever than a million gods". In several episodes in the New Kingdom story "<a href="The%20Contendings%20of%20Horus%20and%20Set">The Contendings of Horus and Set</a>", Isis uses these abilities to outmaneuver Set during his conflict with her son. On one occasion, she transforms into a young woman who tells Set she is involved in an inheritance dispute similar to Set's usurpation of Osiris's crown. When Set calls this situation unjust, Isis taunts him, saying he has judged himself to be in the wrong. In later texts, she uses her powers of transformation to fight and destroy Set and his followers.

Many stories about Isis appear as "<a href="historiolae">historiolae</a>", prologues to magical texts that describe mythic events related to the goal that the spell aims to accomplish. In one spell, Isis creates a snake that bites Ra, who is older and greater than she is, and makes him ill with its venom. She offers to cure Ra if he will tell her his <a href="true%20name">true, secret name</a>—a piece of knowledge that carries with it incomparable power. After much coercion, Ra tells her his name, which she passes on to Horus, bolstering his royal authority. The story may be meant as an origin story to explain why Isis's magical ability surpasses that of other gods, but because she uses magic to subdue Ra, the story seems to treat her as having such abilities even before learning his name.

Many of the roles Isis acquired gave her an important position in the sky. Passages in the "Pyramid Texts" connect Isis closely with <a href="Sopdet">Sopdet</a>, the goddess representing the star <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, whose relationship with her husband <a href="Sah%20%28god%29">Sah</a>—the constellation <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>—and their son <a href="Sopdu">Sopdu</a> parallels Isis's relations with Osiris and Horus. Sirius's <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a>, just before the start of the <a href="Flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">Nile flood</a>, gave Sopdet a close connection with the flood and the resulting growth of plants. Partly because of her relationship with Sopdet, Isis was also linked with the flood, which was sometimes equated with the tears she shed for Osiris. By Ptolemaic times she was connected with rain, which Egyptian texts call a "Nile in the sky"; with the sun as the protector of Ra's barque; and with the moon, possibly because she was linked with the Greek lunar goddess <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> by a shared connection with an Egyptian fertility goddess, <a href="Bastet">Bastet</a>. In hymns inscribed at Philae she is called the "Lady of Heaven" whose dominion over the sky parallels Osiris's rule over the Duat and Horus's kingship on earth.

In Ptolemaic times Isis's sphere of influence could include the entire cosmos. As the deity that protected Egypt and endorsed its king, she had power over all nations, and as the provider of rain, she enlivened the natural world. The Philae hymn that initially calls her ruler of the sky goes on to expand her authority, so at its climax her dominion encompasses the sky, earth, and Duat. It says her power over nature nourishes humans, the blessed dead, and the gods. Other, Greek-language hymns from Ptolemaic Egypt call her "the beautiful essence of all the gods". In the course of Egyptian history, many deities, major and minor, had been described in similar grand terms. Amun was most commonly described this way in the New Kingdom, whereas in Roman Egypt such terms tended to be applied to Isis. Such texts do not deny the existence of other gods but treat them as aspects of the supreme deity, a type of theology sometimes called "<a href="summodeism">summodeism</a>".

In the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman Periods, many temples contained a <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">creation myth</a> that adapted long-standing ideas about creation to give the primary roles to local deities. At Philae, Isis is described as the creator in the same way that older texts speak of the work of the god <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a>, who was said to have designed the world with his intellect and sculpted it into being. Like him, Isis formed the cosmos "through what her heart conceived and her hands created".

Like other gods throughout Egyptian history, Isis had many forms in her individual cult centers, and each cult center emphasized different aspects of her character. Local Isis cults focused on the distinctive traits of their deity more than on her universality, whereas some Egyptian hymns to Isis treat other goddesses in cult centers from across Egypt and the Mediterranean as manifestations of her. A text in Isis's temple at <a href="Dendera%20temple%20complex">Dendera</a> says "in each <a href="nome%20%28Egypt%29">nome</a> it is she who is in every town, in every nome with her son Horus."

In <a href="art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian art</a>, Isis was most commonly depicted as a woman with the typical attributes of a goddess: a sheath dress, a staff of papyrus in one hand, and an "<a href="ankh">ankh</a>" sign in the other. Her original headdress was the throne sign used in writing her name. She and Nephthys often appear together, particularly when mourning Osiris's death, supporting him on his throne, or protecting the <a href="sarcophagi">sarcophagi</a> of the dead. In these situations their arms are often flung across their faces, in a gesture of mourning, or outstretched around Osiris or the deceased as a sign of their protective role. In these circumstances they were often depicted as <a href="kite%20%28bird%29">kites</a> or women with the wings of kites. This form may be inspired by a similarity between the kites' calls and the cries of wailing women, or by a metaphor likening the kite's search for carrion to the goddesses' search for their dead brother. Isis sometimes appeared in other animal forms: as a sow, representing her maternal character; as a cow, particularly when linked with Apis; or as a scorpion. She also took the form of a tree or a woman emerging from a tree, sometimes offering food and water to deceased souls. This form alluded to the maternal nourishment she provided.

Beginning in the New Kingdom, thanks to the close links between Isis and Hathor, Isis took on the other goddess's attributes, such as a <a href="sistrum">sistrum</a> rattle and a headdress of cow horns enclosing a sun disk. Sometimes both her headdresses were combined, so the throne glyph sat atop the sun disk. In the same era, she began to wear the insignia of a human queen, such as a vulture-shaped crown on her head and the royal <a href="uraeus">uraeus</a>, or rearing cobra, on her brow. In Ptolemaic and Roman times, statues and figurines of Isis often showed her in a <a href="ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">Greek sculptural style</a>, with attributes taken from Egyptian and Greek tradition. Some of these images reflected her linkage with other goddesses in novel ways. Isis-Thermuthis, a combination of Isis and Renenutet who represented agricultural fertility, was depicted in this style as a woman with the lower body of a snake. Figurines of a woman wearing an elaborate headdress and <a href="anasyrma">exposing her genitals</a> may represent Isis-Aphrodite.

The "<a href="tyet">tyet</a>" symbol, a looped shape similar to the "ankh", was seen as Isis's particular emblem at least as early as the New Kingdom, though it existed long before. It was often made of red <a href="jasper">jasper</a> and likened to Isis's blood. Used as a funerary <a href="amulet">amulet</a>, it was said to confer her protection on the wearer.

Despite her significance in the Osiris myth, Isis was originally a minor deity in the ideology surrounding the living king. She played only a small role, for instance, in the <a href="Dramatic%20Ramesseum%20Papyrus">Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus</a>, the script for the <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">coronation rituals</a> performed for the accession of <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> in the Middle Kingdom. Her importance grew during the New Kingdom, when she was increasingly connected with Hathor and the human queen.

The early first millennium BCE saw an increased emphasis on the family triad of Osiris, Isis, and Horus and an explosive growth in Isis's popularity. In the fourth century BCE, <a href="Nectanebo%20I">Nectanebo I</a> of the <a href="Thirtieth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirtieth Dynasty</a> claimed Isis as his patron deity, tying her still more closely to political power. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kingdom of Kush</a>, which ruled Nubia from the eighth century BCE to the fourth century CE, absorbed and adapted the Egyptian ideology surrounding kingship. It equated Isis with the "<a href="kandake">kandake</a>", the queen or <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> of the Kushite king.

The <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic</a> Greek kings, who ruled Egypt as pharaohs from 305 to 30 BCE, developed an ideology that linked them with both Egyptian and <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures%23Immortals">Greek gods</a>, to strengthen their claim to the throne in the eyes of their Greek and Egyptian subjects. For centuries before, <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity%23Greek%20colonies">Greek colonists</a> and visitors to Egypt had drawn parallels between Egyptian deities and their own, in a process known as "<a href="interpretatio%20graeca">interpretatio graeca</a>". <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, a Greek who wrote about Egypt in the fifth century BCE, likened Isis to <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a>, whose mythical search for her daughter <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a> resembled Isis's search for Osiris. Demeter was one of the few Greek deities to be widely adopted by Egyptians in Ptolemaic times, so the similarity between her and Isis provided a link between the two cultures. In other cases, Isis was linked with <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> through the sexual aspects of her character. Building on these traditions, the first two Ptolemies promoted the cult of the new god <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a>, who combined aspects of Osiris and <a href="Apis%20%28deity%29">Apis</a> with those of Greek gods like <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. Isis, portrayed in a <a href="Hellenized">Hellenized</a> form, was regarded as the consort of Serapis as well as of Osiris. <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> and his sister and wife <a href="Arsinoe%20II">Arsinoe II</a> developed a <a href="ruler%20cult">ruler cult</a> around themselves, so that they were worshipped in the same temples as Serapis and Isis, and Arsinoe was likened to both Isis and Aphrodite. Some later Ptolemaic queens identified themselves still more closely with Isis. <a href="Cleopatra%20III">Cleopatra III</a>, in the second century BCE, used Isis's name in place of her own in inscriptions, and <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a>, the last ruler of Egypt before it was annexed by <a href="ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, used the epithet "the new Isis".

Down to the end of the New Kingdom, Isis's cult was closely tied to those of male deities such as Osiris, Min, or Amun. She was commonly worshipped alongside them as their mother or consort, and she was especially widely worshipped as the mother of various local forms of Horus. Nevertheless, she had her own independent priesthoods at some sites, and at least one temple of her own, at Osiris's cult center of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>, during the late New Kingdom.

The first known major temples to Isis were the Iseion at <a href="Behbeit%20el-Hagar">Behbeit el-Hagar</a> in northern Egypt and Philae in the far south. Both began construction during the Thirtieth Dynasty and were completed or enlarged by Ptolemaic kings. Thanks to Isis's widespread fame, Philae drew pilgrims from across the Mediterranean. Many other temples of Isis sprang up in Ptolemaic times, ranging from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="Canopus%2C%20Egypt">Canopus</a> on the Mediterranean coast to <a href="Triakontaschoinos">Egypt's frontier with Nubia</a>. A series of temples of Isis stood in that region, stretching from Philae south to <a href="Maharraqa">Maharraqa</a>, and were sites of worship for both Egyptians and various Nubian peoples. The Nubians of Kush built their own temples to Isis at sites as far south as <a href="Wad%20ban%20Naqa">Wad ban Naqa</a>, including one in their capital, <a href="Meroe">Meroe</a>.

The most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which priests clothed the deity's <a href="cult%20image">cult image</a> and offered it food. In Roman times, temples to Isis in Egypt could be built either in Egyptian style, in which the cult image was in a secluded sanctuary accessible only to priests, and in a Greco-Roman style in which devotees were allowed to see the cult image. Yet Greek and Egyptian culture were highly intermingled by this time, and there may have been no ethnic separation between Isis's worshippers. The same people may have prayed to Isis outside Egyptian-style temples and in front of her statue inside Greek-style temples.

Temples also celebrated many festivals in the course of the year, some nationwide and some very local. An elaborate series of rites were performed all across Egypt for Osiris during the month of <a href="Khoiak">Khoiak</a>, and Isis and Nephthys were prominent in these rites at least as early as the New Kingdom. In Ptolemaic times, two women acted out the roles of Isis and Nephthys during Khoiak, singing or chanting in mourning for their dead brother. Their chants are preserved in the <a href="Festival%20Songs%20of%20Isis%20and%20Nephthys">Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys</a> and <a href="Lamentations%20of%20Isis%20and%20Nephthys">Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys</a>.

Eventually, Isis developed her own festivals. In Roman times, Egyptians across the country celebrated her birthday, the Amesysia, by carrying the local cult statue of Isis through their fields, probably celebrating her powers of fertility. The priests at Philae held a festival every ten days when the cult statue of Isis visited the neighboring island of <a href="Bigeh">Bigeh</a>, which was said to be Osiris's place of burial, and the priests performed funerary rites for him. The cult statue also visited the neighboring temples to the south, even during the last centuries of activity at Philae when those temples were run by Nubian peoples outside Roman rule.

<a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire, including Egypt, during the fourth and fifth centuries CE. <a href="Decline%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian temple cults died out</a>, gradually and at various times, from a combination of lack of funds and Christian hostility. Isis's temple at Philae, supported by its Nubian worshippers, still had an organized priesthood and regular festivals until at least the mid-fifth century CE, making it the last fully functioning temple in Egypt.

In many spells in the "Pyramid Texts" Isis and Nephthys help the deceased pharaoh reach the afterlife. In the "Coffin Texts" from the Middle Kingdom, Isis appears still more frequently, though in these texts Osiris is credited with reviving the dead more often than she is. New Kingdom sources such as the "Book of the Dead" describe Isis as protecting deceased souls as they face the dangers in the Duat. They also describe Isis as a member of the divine councils that judge souls' moral righteousness before admitting them into the afterlife, and she appears in vignettes standing beside Osiris as he presides over this tribunal.

Isis and Nephthys took part in funeral ceremonies, where two wailing women, much like those in the festival at Abydos, mourned the deceased as the two goddesses mourned Osiris. Isis was frequently shown or alluded to in funerary equipment: on sarcophagi and <a href="canopic%20chest">canopic chest</a>s as one of the four goddesses who protected the Four Sons of Horus, in tomb art offering her enlivening milk to the dead, and in the "tyet" amulets that were often placed on mummies to ensure that Isis's power would shield them from harm. Late funerary texts prominently featured her mourning for Osiris, and one such text, one of the <a href="Books%20of%20Breathing">Books of Breathing</a>, was said to have been written by her for Osiris's benefit. In Nubian funerary religion, Isis was regarded as more significant than her husband, because she was the active partner while he only passively received the offerings she made to sustain him in the afterlife.

Unlike many Egyptian deities, Isis was rarely addressed in prayers or invoked in <a href="theophoric%20name">personal names</a> before the end of the New Kingdom. From the Late Period on, she became one of the deities most commonly mentioned in these sources, which often refer to her kindly character and her willingness to answer those who call upon her for help. Hundreds of thousands of amulets and votive statues of Isis nursing Horus were made during the first millennium BCE, and in Roman times she was among the deities most commonly represented in household religious art, such as figurines and panel paintings.

Isis was prominent in magical texts from the Middle Kingdom onward. The dangers Horus faces in childhood are a frequent theme in magical healing spells, in which Isis's efforts to heal him are extended to cure any patient. In many of these spells, Isis forces Ra to help Horus by declaring that she will stop the sun in its course through the sky unless her son is cured. Other spells equated pregnant women with Isis to ensure that they would deliver their children successfully.

Egyptian magic began to incorporate Christian concepts as Christianity was established in Egypt, but Egyptian and Greek gods continued to appear in spells long after their temple worship had ceased. Spells that may date to the sixth, seventh, or eighth centuries CE invoke the name of Isis alongside Christian figures.

Cults based in a particular city or nation were the norm across the ancient world until the mid- to late first millennium BCE, when increased contact between different cultures allowed some cults to spread more widely. Greeks were aware of Egyptian deities, including Isis, at least as early as the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic Period</a> (c. 700–480 BCE), and her first known temple in Greece was built in or before the fourth century BCE by Egyptians living in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. The <a href="wars%20of%20Alexander%20the%20Great">conquests of Alexander the Great</a> late in that century created Hellenistic kingdoms around the Mediterranean and Near East, including Ptolemaic Egypt, and put Greek and non-Greek religions in much closer contact. The resulting <a href="trans-cultural%20diffusion">diffusion of cultures</a> allowed many religious traditions to spread across the Hellenistic world in the last three centuries BCE. The new mobile cults adapted greatly to appeal to people from a variety of cultures. The cults of Isis and Serapis, in the Hellenized forms created under the Ptolemies, were among those that expanded in this way.

Spread by merchants and other Mediterranean travelers, the cults of Isis and Serapis were established in Greek port cities at the end of the fourth century BCE and expanded throughout Greece and Asia Minor during the third and second centuries. The Greek island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a> was an early cult center for both deities, and its status as a trading center made it a springboard for the Egyptian cults to diffuse into Italy. Isis and Serapis were also worshipped at scattered sites in the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, the Hellenistic kingdom in the Middle East, as far east as <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, though they disappeared from the region as the Seleucids lost their eastern territory to the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>.

Greeks regarded Egyptian religion as exotic and sometimes bizarre, yet full of ancient wisdom. Like other cults from the eastern regions of the Mediterranean, the cult of Isis attracted Greeks and Romans by playing upon its exotic origins, but the form it took after reaching Greece was heavily Hellenized.

Isis's cult reached Italy and the Roman sphere of influence at some point in the second century BCE. It was one of many cults that were introduced to Rome as the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>'s territory expanded in the last centuries BCE. Authorities in the Republic tried to define which cults were acceptable and which were not, as a way of defining <a href="Romanitas">Roman cultural identity</a> amid the cultural changes brought on by Rome's expansion. In Isis's case, shrines and altars to her were set up on the <a href="Capitoline%20Hill">Capitoline Hill</a>, at the heart of the city, by private persons in the early first century BCE. The independence of her cult from the control of Roman authorities made it potentially unsettling to them. In the 50s and 40s BCE, when the <a href="crisis%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">crisis of the Roman Republic</a> made many Romans fear that <a href="pax%20deorum">peace among the gods</a> was being disrupted, the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> destroyed these shrines, although it did not ban Isis from the city outright.

Egyptian cults faced further hostility during the <a href="Final%20War%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">Final War of the Roman Republic</a> (32–30 BCE), when Rome, led by <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a>, the future <a href="Roman%20emperor">emperor</a> Augustus, fought <a href="Reign%20of%20Cleopatra%20VII">Egypt under Cleopatra VII</a>. After Octavian's victory, he banned shrines to Isis and Serapis within the "<a href="pomerium">pomerium</a>", the city's innermost, sacred boundary, but allowed them in parts of the city outside the "pomerium", thus marking Egyptian deities as non-Roman but acceptable to Rome. Despite being temporarily expelled from Rome during the reign of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (14–37 CE), the Egyptian cults gradually became an accepted part of the Roman religious landscape. The <a href="Flavian%20emperors">Flavian emperors</a> in the late first century CE treated Serapis and Isis as patrons of their rule in much the same manner as traditional Roman gods such as <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>. Even as it was being integrated into Roman culture, Isis's worship developed new features that emphasized its Egyptian background.

The cults also expanded into Rome's western <a href="Roman%20province">provinces</a>, beginning along the Mediterranean coast in early imperial times. At their peak in the late second and early third centuries CE, Isis and Serapis were worshipped in most towns across the western empire, though without much presence in the countryside. Their temples were found from <a href="Petra">Petra</a> and <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a>, in the <a href="Arabia%20Petraea">Arabian</a> and <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syrian</a> provinces, to <a href="Italica">Italica</a> in <a href="Hispania">Spain</a> and <a href="Londinium">Londinium</a> in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britain</a>. By this time they were on a comparable footing with native Roman gods.

Isis's cult, like others in the Greco-Roman world, had no firm <a href="dogma">dogma</a>, and its beliefs and practices may have stayed only loosely similar as it diffused across the region and evolved over time. Greek <a href="aretalogies">aretalogies</a> that praise Isis provide much of the information about these beliefs. Parts of these aretalogies closely resemble ideas in late Egyptian hymns like those at Philae, while other elements are thoroughly Greek. Other information comes from <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (c. 46–120 CE), whose book "On Isis and Osiris" interprets the Egyptian gods based on his <a href="Middle%20Platonist">Middle Platonist</a> philosophy, and from several works of <a href="Greek%20literature">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a> that refer to Isis's worship, especially a novel by <a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a> (c. 125–180 CE) known as "Metamorphoses" or "<a href="The%20Golden%20Ass">The Golden Ass</a>", which ends by describing how the main character has a vision of the goddess and becomes her devotee.

Elaborating upon Isis's role as a wife and mother in the Osiris myth, aretalogies call her the inventor of marriage and parenthood. She was invoked to protect women in childbirth and, in <a href="ancient%20Greek%20novel">ancient Greek novel</a>s such as the "<a href="Ephesian%20Tale">Ephesian Tale</a>", to protect their virginity. Some ancient texts suggested she was the patroness of women in general. Her cult may have served to promote women's autonomy in a limited way, with Isis's power and authority serving as a precedent, but in myth she was devoted to, and never fully independent of, her husband and son. The aretalogies show ambiguous attitudes toward women's independence: one says Isis made women equal to men, whereas another says she made women subordinate to their husbands.

Isis was often characterized as a moon goddess, paralleling the solar characteristics of Serapis. She was also seen as a cosmic goddess more generally. Various texts claim she organized the behavior of the sun, moon, and stars, governing time and the seasons which, in turn, guaranteed the fertility of the earth. These texts also credit her with inventing agriculture, establishing laws, and devising or promoting other elements of human society. This idea derives from older Greek traditions about the role of various Greek gods and <a href="culture%20heroes">culture heroes</a>, including Demeter, in establishing civilization.

She also oversaw seas and harbors. Sailors left inscriptions calling upon her to ensure the safety and good fortune of their voyages. In this role she was called "Isis Pelagia", "Isis of the Sea", or "Isis Pharia", referring to a sail or to the island of Pharos, site of the <a href="Lighthouse%20of%20Alexandria">Lighthouse of Alexandria</a>. This form of Isis, which emerged in Hellenistic times, may have been inspired by Egyptian images of Isis in a barque, as well as by Greek gods who protected seafaring, such as Aphrodite. "Isis Pelagia" developed an added significance in Rome. Rome's food supply was dependent on <a href="Cura%20Annonae">grain shipments from its provinces</a>, especially Egypt. Isis therefore guaranteed fertile harvests and protected the ships that carried the resulting food across the seas—and thus ensured the <a href="salus">well-being of the empire</a> as a whole. Her protection of the state was said to extend to Rome's armies, much as it was in Ptolemaic Egypt, and she was sometimes called "Isis Invicta", "Unconquered Isis". Her roles were so numerous that she came to be called "myrionymos", "one with countless names," and "panthea", "all-goddess". Both Plutarch and a later philosopher, <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a>, mentioned a <a href="veil%20of%20Isis">veiled statue</a> of the Egyptian goddess <a href="Neith">Neith</a> that they conflated with Isis, citing it as an example of her universality and enigmatic wisdom. It bore the words "I am all that has been and is and will be; and no mortal has ever lifted my mantle."

Isis was also said to benefit her followers in the afterlife, which was not much emphasized in Greek and Roman religion. "The Golden Ass" and inscriptions left by worshippers of Isis suggest that many of her followers thought she would guarantee them a better afterlife in return for their devotion. They characterized this afterlife inconsistently. Some said they would benefit from Osiris's enlivening water while others expected to sail to the <a href="Fortunate%20Isles">Fortunate Isles</a> of Greek tradition.

As in Egypt, Isis was said to have power over fate, which in traditional Greek religion was a power not even the gods could defy. Valentino Gasparini says this control over destiny binds together Isis's disparate traits. She governs the cosmos, yet she also relieves people of their comparatively trivial misfortunes, and her influence extends into the realm of death, which is "individual and universal at the same time".

More than a dozen Egyptian gods were worshipped outside Egypt in Hellenistic and Roman times in a series of interrelated cults, though many were fairly minor. Of the most important of these deities, Serapis was closely connected with Isis and often appeared with her in art, but Osiris remained central to her myth and prominent in her rituals. Temples to Isis and Serapis sometimes stood next to each other, but it was rare for a single temple to be dedicated to both. Osiris, as a dead deity unlike the immortal gods of Greece, seemed strange to Greeks and played only a minor role in Egyptian cults in Hellenistic times. In Roman times he became, like Dionysus, a symbol of a joyous afterlife, and the Isis cult increasingly focused on him. Horus, often under the name <a href="Harpocrates">Harpocrates</a>, also appeared in Isis's temples as her son by Osiris or Serapis. He absorbed traits from Greek gods such as <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and served as a god of the sun and of crops. Another member of the group was Anubis, who was linked to the Greek god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> in his Hellenized form <a href="Hermanubis">Hermanubis</a>. Isis was also sometimes said to have learned her wisdom from, or even be the daughter of, <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge, who was known in the Greco-Roman world as <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a>.

Isis also had an extensive network of connections with Greek and Roman deities, as well as some from other cultures. She was not fully integrated into the Greek pantheon, but she was at different times equated with a variety of Greek mythological figures, including Demeter, Aphrodite, or <a href="Io%20%28mythology%29">Io</a>, a human woman who was turned into a cow and chased by the goddess <a href="Hera">Hera</a> from Greece to Egypt. The cult of Demeter was an especially important Hellenizing influence on Isis's worship after its arrival in Greece. Isis's relationship with women was influenced by her frequent equation with Artemis, who had a dual role as a virgin goddess and a promoter of fertility. Because of Isis's power over fate, she was linked with the Greek and Roman personifications of fortune, <a href="Tyche">Tyche</a> and <a href="Fortuna">Fortuna</a>. At <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> in <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> in the second millennium BCE, Hathor had been worshipped as a form of the local goddess <a href="Baalat%20Gebal">Baalat Gebal</a>; Isis gradually replaced Hathor there in the course of the first millennium BCE. In <a href="Noricum">Noricum</a> in central Europe, Isis was syncretized with the local <a href="tutelary%20deity">tutelary deity</a> Noreia, and at Petra she may have been linked with the Arab goddess <a href="al-Uzza">al-Uzza</a>. The Roman author <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> said <a href="%26quot%3BIsis%26quot%3B%20of%20the%20Suebi">Isis was worshipped by the Suebi</a>, a <a href="Germanic%20people">Germanic people</a> living outside the empire, but he may have mistaken a <a href="Germanic%20deities">Germanic goddess</a> for Isis because, like her, the goddess was symbolized by a ship.

Many of the aretalogies include long lists of goddesses with whom Isis was linked. These texts treat all the deities they list as forms of her, suggesting that in the eyes of the authors she was a summodeistic being: the one goddess for the entire <a href="oecumene">civilized world</a>. In the Roman religious world, many deities were referred to as "one" or "unique" in religious texts like these. At the same time, <a href="Hellenistic%20philosophers">Hellenistic philosophers</a> frequently saw the unifying, abstract principle of the cosmos as divine. Many of them reinterpreted traditional religions to fit their concept of this highest being, as Plutarch did with Isis and Osiris. In "The Golden Ass" Isis says "my one person manifests the aspects of all the gods and goddesses" and that she is "worshipped by all the world under different forms, with various rites, and by manifold names," although the Egyptians and Nubians use her true name, Isis. But when she lists the forms in which various Mediterranean peoples worship her, she mentions only female deities. Greco-Roman deities were firmly divided by gender, thus limiting how universal Isis could truly be. One aretalogy avoids this problem by calling Isis and Serapis, who was often said to subsume many male gods, the two "unique" deities. Similarly, both Plutarch and Apuleius limit Isis's importance by treating her as ultimately subordinate to Osiris. The claim that she was unique was meant to emphasize her greatness more than to make a precise theological statement.

Images of Isis made outside Egypt were Hellenistic in style, like many of the images of her made in Egypt in Hellenistic and Roman times. The attributes she bore varied widely. She sometimes wore the Hathoric cow-horn headdress, but Greeks and Romans reduced its size and often interpreted it as a crescent moon. She could also wear headdresses incorporating leaves, flowers, or ears of grain. Other common traits included corkscrew locks of hair and an elaborate mantle tied in a large knot over the breasts, which originated in ordinary Egyptian clothing but was treated as a symbol of the goddess outside Egypt. In her hands she could carry a uraeus or a sistrum, both taken from her Egyptian iconography, or a <a href="situla">situla</a>, a vessel used for <a href="libation">libation</a>s of water or milk that were performed in Isis's cult.

As Isis-Fortuna or Isis-Tyche she held a rudder, representing control of fate, in her right hand and a <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a>, standing for abundance, in her left. As Isis Pharia she wore a cloak that billowed behind her like a sail, and as Isis Lactans, she nursed Harpocrates. The diverse imagery sprang from her varied roles; as Robert Steven Bianchi says, "Isis could represent anything to anyone and could be represented in any way imaginable."

Like most cults of the time, the Isis cult did not require its devotees to worship Isis <a href="religious%20exclusivism">exclusively</a>, and their level of commitment probably varied greatly. Some devotees of Isis served as priests in a variety of cults and underwent several initiations dedicated to different gods. Nevertheless, many emphasized their strong devotion to her, and some considered her the focus of their lives. They were among the very few religious groups in the Greco-Roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves, loosely equivalent to "Jew" or "Christian", that might indicate they defined themselves by their religious affiliation. However, the word—"Isiacus" or "Isiac"—was rarely used.

Isiacs were a very small proportion of the Roman Empire's population, but they came from every <a href="social%20class%20in%20ancient%20Rome">level of society</a>, from <a href="slavery%20in%20ancient%20Rome">slaves</a> and <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> to high officials and members of the imperial family. Ancient accounts imply that Isis was popular with lower social classes, providing a possible reason why authorities in the Roman Republic, troubled by struggles between classes, regarded her cult with suspicion. Women were more strongly represented in the Isis cult than in most Greco-Roman cults, and in imperial times, they could serve as priestesses in many of the same positions in the hierarchy as their male counterparts. Women make up much less than half of the Isiacs known from inscriptions and are rarely listed among the higher ranks of priests, but because women are underrepresented in Roman inscriptions, their participation may have been greater than is recorded. Several Roman writers accused Isis's cult of encouraging promiscuity among women. Jaime Alvar suggests the cult attracted male suspicion simply because it gave women a venue to act outside their husbands' control.

Priests of Isis were known for their distinctive shaven heads and white linen clothes, both characteristics drawn from Egyptian priesthoods and their requirements of <a href="ritual%20purity">ritual purity</a>. A temple of Isis could include several ranks of priests, as well as various cultic associations and specialized duties for lay devotees. There is no evidence of a hierarchy overseeing multiple temples, and each temple may well have functioned independently of the others.

Temples to Egyptian deities outside Egypt, such as the <a href="Red%20Basilica">Red Basilica</a> in <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>, the <a href="Temple%20of%20Isis%20at%20Pompeii">Temple of Isis at Pompeii</a>, or the <a href="Iseum%20Campense">Iseum Campense</a> in Rome, were built in a largely Greco-Roman style but, like Egyptian temples, were surrounded by large courts enclosed by walls. They were decorated with Egyptian-themed artwork, sometimes including antiquities imported from Egypt. Their layout was more elaborate than that of traditional Roman temples and included rooms for housing priests and for various ritual functions, with a cult statue of the goddess in a secluded sanctuary. Unlike Egyptian cult images, Isis's Hellenistic and Roman statues were life-size or larger. The daily ritual still entailed dressing the statue in elaborate clothes each morning and offering it libations, but in contrast with Egyptian tradition, the priests allowed ordinary devotees of Isis to see the cult statue during the morning ritual, pray to it directly, and sing hymns before it.

Another object of veneration in these temples was water, which was treated as a symbol of the waters of the Nile. Isis temples built in Hellenistic times often included underground cisterns that stored this sacred water, raising and lowering the water level in imitation of the Nile flood. Many Roman temples instead used a pitcher of water that was worshipped as a cult image or manifestation of Osiris.

Roman "<a href="lararia">lararia</a>", or household shrines, contained statuettes of the "<a href="penates">penates</a>", a varied group of protective deities chosen based on the preferences of the members of the household. Isis and other Egyptian deities were found in "lararia" in Italy from the late first century BCE to the beginning of the fourth century CE.

The cult asked both ritual and moral purity of its devotees, periodically requiring ritual baths or days-long periods of sexual abstinence. Isiacs sometimes displayed their piety on irregular occasions, singing Isis's praises in the streets or, as a form of <a href="penance">penance</a>, declaring their misdeeds in public.

Some temples to Greek deities, including Serapis, practiced <a href="incubation%20%28ritual%29">incubation</a>, in which worshippers slept in a temple hoping that the god would appear to them in a dream and give them advice or heal their ailments. Some scholars believe that this practice took place in Isis's temples, but there is no firm evidence that it did. Isis was, however, thought to communicate through dreams in other circumstances, including to call worshippers to undergo initiation.

Some temples of Isis performed <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">mystery rites</a> to <a href="religious%20initiation%20rites">initiate</a> new members of the cult. Although these rites are among the best-known elements of Isis's Greco-Roman cult, they are only known to have been performed in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor. By giving the devotee a dramatic, mystical experience of the goddess, initiations added emotional intensity to the process of joining her following.

"The Golden Ass", in describing how the protagonist joins Isis's cult, gives the only detailed account of Isiac initiation. Apuleius's motives for writing about the cult and the accuracy of his fictionalized description are much debated. But the account is broadly consistent with other evidence about initiations, and scholars rely heavily on it when studying the subject.

Ancient mystery rites used a variety of intense experiences, such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise, to overwhelm their senses and give them an intense <a href="religious%20experience">religious experience</a> that felt like direct contact with the god they devoted themselves to. Apuleius's protagonist, Lucius, undergoes a series of initiations, though only the first is described in detail. After entering the innermost part of Isis's temple at night, he says, "I came to the boundary of death and, having trodden on the threshold of <a href="Proserpina">Proserpina</a>, I travelled through all the elements and returned. In the middle of the night I saw the sun flashing with bright light, I came face to face with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand." This cryptic description suggests that the initiate's symbolic journey to the world of the dead was likened to Osiris's rebirth, as well as to Ra's journey through the underworld in Egyptian myth, possibly implying that Isis brought the initiate back from death as she did her husband.

Roman calendars listed the two most important <a href="Roman%20festival">festivals</a> of Isis as early as the first century CE. The first festival was the <a href="Navigium%20Isidis">Navigium Isidis</a> in March, which celebrated Isis's influence over the sea and served as a prayer for the safety of seafarers and, eventually, of the Roman people and their leaders. It consisted of an elaborate procession, including Isiac priests and devotees with a wide variety of costumes and sacred emblems, carrying a model ship from the local Isis temple to the sea or to a nearby river. The other was the <a href="Isia%20%28festival%29">Isia</a> in late October and early November. Like its Egyptian forerunner, the Khoiak festival, the Isia included a ritual reenactment of Isis's search for Osiris, followed by jubilation when the god's body was found. Several more minor festivals were dedicated to Isis, including the <a href="Pelusia">Pelusia</a> in late March that may have celebrated the birth of Harpocrates, and the <a href="Lychnapsia">Lychnapsia</a>, or lamp-lit festival, that celebrated Isis's own birth on August 12.

Festivals of Isis and other polytheistic gods were celebrated throughout the fourth century CE, despite the <a href="Christianization%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">growth of Christianity</a> in that era and the <a href="Persecution%20of%20pagans%20in%20the%20late%20Roman%20Empire">persecution of pagans</a> that intensified toward the end of the century. The Isia was celebrated at least as late as 417 CE, and the Navigium Isidis lasted well into the sixth century. Increasingly, the religious meaning of all Roman festivals was forgotten or ignored even as the customs continued. In some cases, these customs became part of the combined classical and Christian culture of the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>.

A contentious question about Isis is whether her cult influenced Christianity. Some Isiac customs may have been among the pagan religious practices that were <a href="Interpretatio%20Christiana">incorporated into Christian traditions</a> as the Roman Empire was Christianized. <a href="Andreas%20Alf%C3%B6ldi">Andreas Alföldi</a>, for instance, argued in the 1930s that the medieval <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a> festival, in which a model boat was carried, developed from the Navigium Isidis.

Much attention focuses on whether traits of Christianity were borrowed from pagan mystery cults, including that of Isis. The more devoted members of Isis's cult made a personal commitment to a deity they regarded as superior to others, as Christians did. Both Christianity and the Isis cult had an initiation rite: the mysteries for Isis, <a href="baptism">baptism</a> in Christianity. One of the mystery cults' shared themes—a god whose <a href="dying-and-rising%20deity">death and resurrection</a> may be connected with the individual worshipper's well-being in the afterlife—resembles the central theme of Christianity. The suggestion that Christianity's basic beliefs were taken from the mystery cults has provoked heated debate for more than 200 years. In response to these controversies, both Hugh Bowden and Jaime Alvar, scholars who study ancient mystery cults, suggest that similarities between Christianity and the mystery cults were not produced by simple borrowing of ideas but by their common background: the Greco-Roman culture in which they all developed.

Isis's similarities to <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>, have also been scrutinized. They have been subject to controversy between <a href="Protestant%20Christianity">Protestant Christians</a> and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, as many Protestants have argued that Catholic <a href="veneration%20of%20Mary">veneration of Mary</a> is a remnant of paganism. The classicist R. E. Witt saw Isis as the "great forerunner" of Mary. He suggested that converts to Christianity who had formerly worshipped Isis would have seen Mary in much the same terms as their traditional goddess. He pointed out that the two had several spheres of influence in common, such as agriculture and the protection of sailors. He compared Mary's title "<a href="Mother%20of%20God">Mother of God</a>" to Isis's epithet "mother of the god", and Mary's "<a href="queen%20of%20heaven">queen of heaven</a>" to Isis's "<a href="queen%20of%20heaven%20%28antiquity%29">queen of heaven</a>". Stephen Benko, a historian of early Christianity, argues that devotion to Mary was deeply influenced by the worship of several pagan goddesses, not just Isis. In contrast, <a href="John%20McGuckin">John McGuckin</a>, a <a href="church%20historian">church historian</a>, says that Mary absorbed superficial traits from these goddesses, such as iconography, but the fundamentals of her cult were thoroughly Christian.

Images of Isis with Horus in her lap are often suggested as an influence on the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">iconography of Mary</a>, particularly images of the <a href="Nursing%20Madonna">Nursing Madonna</a>, as images of nursing women were rare in the ancient Mediterranean world outside Egypt. Vincent Tran Tam Tinh points out that the latest images of Isis nursing Horus date to the fourth century CE, while the earliest images of Mary nursing Jesus date to the seventh century CE. Sabrina Higgins, drawing on Tran Tam Tinh's study, argues that if there is a connection between the iconographies of Isis and Mary, it is limited to Nursing Madonna images from Egypt. In contrast, Thomas F. Mathews and Norman Muller think Isis's pose in late antique panel paintings influenced several types of Marian icons, inside and outside Egypt. Elizabeth Bolman says these early Egyptian images of Mary nursing Jesus were meant to emphasize his divinity, much as images of nursing goddesses did in ancient Egyptian iconography. Higgins argues that such similarities prove that images of Isis influenced those of Mary, but not that Christians deliberately adopted Isis's iconography or other elements of her cult.

The memory of Isis survived the extinction of her worship. Like the Greeks and Romans, many modern Europeans have regarded ancient Egypt as the home of profound and often mystical wisdom, and this wisdom has often been linked with Isis. <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a>'s biography of Isis in his 1374 work "<a href="De%20mulieribus%20claris">De mulieribus claris</a>", based on classical sources, treated her as a historical queen who taught skills of civilization to humankind. Some <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> thinkers elaborated this perspective on Isis. <a href="Annio%20da%20Viterbo">Annio da Viterbo</a>, in the 1490s, claimed Isis and Osiris had civilized Italy before Greece, thus drawing a direct connection between his home country and Egypt. The <a href="Borgia%20Apartments">Borgia Apartments</a> painted for Annio's patron, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20VI">Pope Alexander VI</a>, incorporate this same theme in their illustrated rendition of the Osiris myth.

<a href="Western%20esotericism">Western esotericism</a> has often made reference to Isis. Two Roman esoteric texts used the mythic motif in which Isis passes down secret knowledge to Horus. In "Kore Kosmou", she teaches him wisdom passed down from <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a>, and in the early <a href="alchemical">alchemical</a> text "Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus", she gives him alchemical recipes. Early modern esoteric literature, which saw Hermes Trismegistus as an Egyptian sage and frequently made use of texts attributed to his hand, sometimes referred to Isis as well. In a different vein, Apuleius's description of Isiac initiation has influenced the practices of many <a href="secret%20societies">secret societies</a>. <a href="Jean%20Terrasson">Jean Terrasson</a>'s 1731 novel "<a href="Life%20of%20Sethos">Sethos</a>" used Apuleius as inspiration for a fanciful Egyptian initiation rite dedicated to Isis. It was imitated by actual rituals in various <a href="Masonic">Masonic</a> and Masonic-inspired societies during the 18th century, as well as in other literary works, most notably <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>'s 1791 opera "<a href="The%20Magic%20Flute">The Magic Flute</a>".

From the Renaissance on, the <a href="veil%20of%20Isis">veiled statue of Isis</a> that Plutarch and Proclus mentioned was interpreted as a personification of <a href="nature">nature</a>, based on a passage in the works of <a href="Macrobius">Macrobius</a> in the fifth century CE that equated Isis with nature. Authors in the 17th and 18th centuries ascribed a wide variety of meanings to this image. Isis represented nature as the mother of all things, as a set of truths waiting to be unveiled by science, as a symbol of the <a href="pantheist">pantheist</a> concept of an anonymous, enigmatic deity who was <a href="immanent">immanent</a> within nature, or as an awe-inspiring <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime power</a> that could be experienced through ecstatic mystery rites. In the <a href="dechristianization%20of%20France%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution">dechristianization of France during the French Revolution</a>, she served as an alternative to traditional Christianity: a symbol that could represent nature, modern scientific wisdom, and a link to the pre-Christian past. For these reasons, Isis's image appeared in artwork sponsored by the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">revolutionary government</a>, such as the <a href="Fontaine%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ration">Fontaine de la Régénération</a>, and by the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>. The metaphor of Isis's veil continued to circulate through the 19th century. <a href="Helena%20Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky</a>, the founder of the esoteric <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">Theosophical</a> tradition, titled her 1877 book on Theosophy "<a href="Isis%20Unveiled">Isis Unveiled</a>", implying that it would reveal spiritual truths about nature that science could not.

Among modern Egyptians, Isis was used as a national symbol during the <a href="Pharaonism">Pharaonism</a> movement of the 1920s and 1930s, as Egypt gained independence from <a href="history%20of%20Egypt%20under%20the%20British">British rule</a>. In works such as Mohamed Naghi's painting in the <a href="parliament%20of%20Egypt">parliament of Egypt</a>, titled "Egypt's Renaissance", and <a href="Tawfiq%20al-Hakim">Tawfiq al-Hakim</a>'s play "The Return of the Spirit", Isis symbolizes the revival of the nation. A sculpture by <a href="Mahmoud%20Mokhtar">Mahmoud Mokhtar</a>, also called "Egypt's Renaissance", plays upon the motif of Isis's removing her veil.

Isis is found frequently in works of fiction, such as a <a href="Isis%20%28DC%20Comics%29">superhero franchise</a>, and her name and image appear in places as disparate as advertisements and personal names. The name "Isidoros", meaning "gift of Isis" in Greek, survived in Christianity despite its pagan origins, giving rise to the English name <a href="Isidore">Isidore</a> and its variants. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, "Isis" itself became a popular feminine <a href="Isis%20%28given%20name%29">given name</a>.

Isis continues to appear in modern esoteric and <a href="modern%20pagan">pagan</a> belief systems. The concept of a single goddess incarnating all feminine divine powers, partly inspired by Apuleius, became a widespread theme in literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Influential groups and figures in esotericism, such as the <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> in the late 19th century and <a href="Dion%20Fortune">Dion Fortune</a> in the 1930s, adopted this all-encompassing goddess into their belief systems and called her Isis. This conception of Isis influenced the <a href="Great%20Goddess">Great Goddess</a> found in many forms of <a href="contemporary%20witchcraft">contemporary witchcraft</a>. Today, <a href="Kemetism">reconstructions of ancient Egyptian religion</a>, such as <a href="Kemetic%20Orthodoxy">Kemetic Orthodoxy</a> or the Church of the Eternal Source, include Isis among the deities they revere. An eclectic religious organization focused on female divinity calls itself the <a href="Fellowship%20of%20Isis">Fellowship of Isis</a> because, in the words of one of its priestesses, M. Isidora Forrest, Isis can be "all Goddesses to all people".

Falstaff (opera)

Falstaff () is a comic <a href="opera">opera</a> in three acts by the Italian composer <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>. The <a href="libretto">libretto</a> was adapted by <a href="Arrigo%20Boito">Arrigo Boito</a> from <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>" and scenes from "Henry IV", parts <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">1</a> and <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">2</a>. The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a>, Milan.

Verdi wrote "Falstaff", which was the last of his 28 operas, as he was approaching the age of 80. It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following "<a href="Macbeth%20%28opera%29">Macbeth</a>" and "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>". The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight, <a href="Sir%20John%20Falstaff">Sir John Falstaff</a>, to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands' wealth.

Verdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, "Falstaff" did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> insisted on its revival at La Scala and the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>, <a href="Georg%20Solti">Georg Solti</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>. The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.

Verdi made numerous changes to the music after the first performance, and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on a definitive score. The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings. Singers closely associated with the title role have included <a href="Victor%20Maurel">Victor Maurel</a> (the first Falstaff), <a href="Mariano%20Stabile">Mariano Stabile</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Valdengo">Giuseppe Valdengo</a>, <a href="Tito%20Gobbi">Tito Gobbi</a>, <a href="Geraint%20Evans">Geraint Evans</a> and <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a>.

By 1889 Verdi had been an opera composer for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, "<a href="Un%20giorno%20di%20regno">Un giorno di regno</a>", staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer <a href="Rossini">Rossini</a> commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed and said that he longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in "<a href="Un%20ballo%20in%20maschera">Un ballo in maschera</a>" and "<a href="La%20forza%20del%20destino">La forza del destino</a>".

For a comic subject Verdi considered <a href="Cervantes">Cervantes</a>'s "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>" and plays by <a href="Goldoni">Goldoni</a>, <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a> and <a href="Labiche">Labiche</a>, but found none of them wholly suitable. The singer <a href="Victor%20Maurel">Victor Maurel</a> sent him a French libretto based on Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>". Verdi liked it, but replied that "to deal with it properly you need a Rossini or a <a href="Donizetti">Donizetti</a>". Following the success of "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>" in 1887 he commented, "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." He confided his ambition to the librettist of "Otello", <a href="Arrigo%20Boito">Arrigo Boito</a>. Boito said nothing at the time, but he secretly began work on a libretto based on "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>" with additional material taken from "Henry IV", parts <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">1</a> and <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">2</a>. Many composers had set the play to music, with little success, among them <a href="Carl%20Ditters%20von%20Dittersdorf">Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf</a> (1796), <a href="Antonio%20Salieri">Antonio Salieri</a> (<a href="Falstaff%20%28Salieri%29">1799</a>), <a href="Michael%20William%20Balfe">Michael William Balfe</a> (1835) and <a href="Adolphe%20Adam">Adolphe Adam</a> (1856). The first version to secure a place in the operatic repertoire was <a href="Otto%20Nicolai">Otto Nicolai</a>'s "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor%20%28opera%29">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>" in 1849, but its success was largely confined to German opera houses.

Boito was doubly pleased with "The Merry Wives" as a plot. Not only was it Shakespearian, it was based in part on <a href="Trecento">Trecento</a> Italian works – "Il Pecorone" by Ser <a href="Giovanni%20Fiorentino">Giovanni Fiorentino</a>, and <a href="Boccaccio">Boccaccio</a>'s "<a href="Decameron">Decameron</a>". Boito adopted a deliberately archaic form of Italian to "lead Shakespeare's farce back to its clear Tuscan source", as he put it. He trimmed the plot, halved the number of characters in the play, and gave the character of <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a> more depth by incorporating dozens of passages from "Henry IV".

Verdi received the draft libretto a few weeks later, by early July 1889, at a time when his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare's play: "Benissimo! Benissimo! ... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back. Like Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare's plays in Italian translations by <a href="Carlo%20Rusconi">Carlo Rusconi</a> and , which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" (in 1847) and "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" (in 1887) and had considered "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" as a subject; Boito had suggested "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>".
Verdi still had doubts, and on the next day sent another letter to Boito expressing his concerns. He wrote of "the large number of years" in his age, his health (which he admitted was still good) and his ability to complete the project: "if I were not to finish the music?" He said that the project could all be a waste of the younger man's time and distract Boito from completing his own new opera (which became "<a href="Nerone%20%28Boito%29">Nerone</a>"). Yet, as his biographer <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Phillips-Matz">Mary Jane Phillips-Matz</a> notes, "Verdi could not hide his delight at the idea of writing another opera". On 10 July 1889 he wrote again:
Boito's original sketch is lost, but surviving correspondence shows that the finished opera is not greatly different from his first thoughts. The major differences were that an act 2 monologue for Ford was moved from scene 2 to scene 1, and that the last act originally ended with the marriage of the lovers rather than with the lively vocal and orchestral <a href="fugue">fugue</a>, which was Verdi's idea. He wrote to Boito in August 1889 telling him that he was writing a fugue: "Yes, Sir! A fugue... and a "buffa" fugue", which "could probably be fitted in".
Verdi accepted the need to trim Shakespeare's plot to keep the opera within an acceptable length. He was sorry, nonetheless, to see the loss of Falstaff's second humiliation, dressed up as the Wise Woman of <a href="Brentford">Brentford</a> to escape from Ford. He wrote of his desire to do justice to Shakespeare: "To sketch the characters in a few strokes, to weave the plot, to extract all the juice from that enormous Shakespearian orange". Shortly after the premiere an English critic, <a href="R%20A%20Streatfeild">R A Streatfeild</a>, remarked on how Verdi succeeded:
In November Boito took the completed first act to Verdi at <a href="Villa%20Verdi">Sant'Agata</a>, along with the second act, which was still under construction: "That act has the devil on its back; and when you touch it, it burns", Boito complained. They worked on the opera for a week, then Verdi and his wife <a href="Giuseppina%20Strepponi">Giuseppina Strepponi</a> went to Genoa. No more work was done for some time.

The writer Russ McDonald observes that a letter from Boito to Verdi touches on the musical techniques used in the opera – he wrote of how to portray the characters Nannetta and Fenton: "I can't quite explain it: I would like as one sprinkles sugar on a tart to sprinkle the whole comedy with that happy love without concentrating it at any one point."

The first act was completed by March 1890; the rest of the opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist <a href="Roger%20Parker">Roger Parker</a> comments that this piecemeal approach may have been "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors <a href="Franco%20Faccio">Franco Faccio</a> and <a href="Emanuele%20Muzio">Emanuele Muzio</a>. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: "in writing "Falstaff", I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: "Will I finish it [Falstaff]? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into:

Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi reported that he was still working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in "Falstaff". For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the <a href="baritone">baritone</a> who had sung Iago in "Otello", but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [and] incredible that there was nothing else to do but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.

By September Verdi had agreed in a letter to his publisher <a href="Casa%20Ricordi">Casa Ricordi</a> that La Scala could present the premiere during the 1892–93 season, but that he would retain control over every aspect of the production. An early February date was mentioned along with the demand that the house would be available exclusively after 2 January 1893 and that, even after the dress rehearsal, he could withdraw the opera: "I will leave the theatre, and [Ricordi] will have to take the score away". The public learned of the new opera towards the end of 1892, and intense interest was aroused, increased rather than diminished by the secrecy with which Verdi surrounded the preparations; rehearsals were in private, and the press was kept at arm's length. Apart from Verdi's outrage at the way that La Scala announced the season's programme on 7 December – "either a revival of "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>" or "Falstaff"" – things went smoothly in January 1893 up to the premiere performance on 9 February.

The first performance of "Falstaff" was at <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a> in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly six years after Verdi's previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success under the baton of <a href="Edoardo%20Mascheroni">Edoardo Mascheroni</a>; numbers were encored, and at the end the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.

Over the next two months the work was given twenty-two performances in Milan and then taken by the original company, led by Maurel, to Genoa, Rome, Venice, Trieste, Vienna and, without Maurel, to Berlin. Verdi and his wife left Milan on 2 March; Ricordi encouraged the composer to go to the planned Rome performance of 14 April, to maintain the momentum and excitement that the opera had generated. The Verdis, along with Boito and Giulio Ricordi, attended together with <a href="King%20Umberto%20I">King Umberto I</a> and other major royal and political figures of the day. The king introduced Verdi to the audience from the Royal Box to great acclaim, "a national recognition and apotheosis of Verdi that had never been tendered him before", notes Phillips-Matz.

During these early performances Verdi made substantial changes to the score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have had to rely on the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted to keep up with the changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.
The first performances outside the Kingdom of Italy were in <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> and Vienna, in May 1893. The work was given in the Americas and across Europe. The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> that he drafted a letter to Verdi, in which he addressed him as "Italy's leading composer" and "one of the noblest persons of our time", and in which he explained that ""Falstaff" provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that I can ... date [to the experience] the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life." <a href="Antonio%20Scotti">Antonio Scotti</a> played the title role in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> in July 1893; <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> conducted the opera in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in January 1894; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month. Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe, and for the production there in April 1894 Boito, who was fluent in French, made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul Solanges. This translation, approved by Verdi, is quite free in its rendering of Boito's original Italian text. Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty-Kingston and <a href="Max%20Kalbeck">Max Kalbeck</a> respectively. The London premiere, sung in Italian, was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894. The conductor was Mancinelli, and Zilli and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles. Falstaff was sung by Arturo Pessina; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season. On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, New York; Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff, <a href="Emma%20Eames">Emma Eames</a> as Alice, <a href="Z%C3%A9lie%20de%20Lussan">Zélie de Lussan</a> as Nannetta and <a href="Sofia%20Scalchi">Sofia Scalchi</a> as Mistress Quickly.

After the initial excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed by the absence of big traditional arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: "'Is this our Verdi?' they asked themselves. 'But where is the "motive"; where are the broad melodies ... where are the usual "ensembles"; the "finales"?'" By the time of Verdi's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire. The rising young conductor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed "Falstaff" from the start of his tenure. <a href="Richard%20Aldrich%20%28music%20critic%29">Richard Aldrich</a>, music critic of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", wrote that Toscanini's revival "ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. "Falstaff", which was first produced here on February 4, 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all." Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, "to connoisseurs it was an unending delight".

In Britain, as in continental Europe and the US, the work fell out of the repertoire. <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> revived it in 1919, and recalling in his memoirs that the public had stayed away he commented:
Toscanini recognised that this was the view of many, but he believed the work to be Verdi's greatest opera; he said, "I believe it will take years and years before the general public understand this masterpiece, but when they really know it they will run to hear it like they do now for "Rigoletto" and "La traviata"."

Toscanini returned to La Scala in 1921 and remained in charge there until 1929, presenting "Falstaff" in every season. He took the work to Germany and Austria in the late 1920s and the 1930s, conducting it in Vienna, Berlin and at three successive <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>s. Among those inspired by Toscanini's performances were <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> and <a href="Georg%20Solti">Georg Solti</a>, who were among his "<a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a>s" at Salzburg. Toscanini's younger colleague <a href="Tullio%20Serafin">Tullio Serafin</a> continued to present the work in Germany and Austria after Toscanini refused to perform there because of his loathing of the Nazi regime.

When Karajan was in a position to do so he added "Falstaff" to the repertoire of his opera company at <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> in 1941, and he remained a proponent of the work for the rest of his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with "Falstaff", as did <a href="Carlo%20Maria%20Giulini">Carlo Maria Giulini</a>; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> conducted the work at the Met and the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.

Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as particularly notable the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne</a> productions with <a href="Fernando%20Corena">Fernando Corena</a> and later <a href="Geraint%20Evans">Geraint Evans</a> in the title role; three different stagings by <a href="Franco%20Zeffirelli">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, for the <a href="Holland%20Festival">Holland Festival</a> (1956), Covent Garden (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and <a href="Luchino%20Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a>'s 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by <a href="Ronald%20Eyre">Ronald Eyre</a>, more reflective and melancholy than usual, was staged in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, London and <a href="Florence">Florence</a>; <a href="Renato%20Bruson">Renato Bruson</a> was Falstaff and Giulini conducted. Among more recent players of the title role <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a> has taken the part at Covent Garden in 1999, in a production by <a href="Graham%20Vick">Graham Vick</a>, conducted by <a href="Bernard%20Haitink">Bernard Haitink</a>. and at the Metropolitan Opera in a revival of the Zeffirelli production, conducted by <a href="James%20Levine">James Levine</a> in 2006.

Although "Falstaff" has become a regular repertoire work there nonetheless remains a view expressed by John von Rhein in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" in 1985: ""Falstaff" probably always will fall into the category of 'connoisseur's opera' rather than taking its place as a popular favorite on the order of "La traviata" or "Aida.""

"A room at the Garter Inn"

Falstaff and his servants, Bardolfo and Pistola, are drinking at the inn. Dr Caius bursts in and accuses Falstaff of burgling his house and Bardolfo of picking his pocket. He is ejected. Falstaff hands a letter to each of his servants for delivery to Alice Ford and Meg Page, two wealthy married women. In these two identical letters, Falstaff professes his love for each of the women, although it is access to their husbands' money that he chiefly covets. Bardolfo and Pistola refuse, claiming that honour prevents them from obeying him. Falstaff dispatches his page, Robin, to deliver the letters. Falstaff delivers a tirade at his rebellious followers ("L'onore! Ladri ... ! " / "Honour! You rogues ... !") telling them that honour is a mere word and is of no practical value. He chases them out of his sight.

"Ford's garden"

Alice and Meg have received Falstaff's letters. They compare them, see that they are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton is in love with Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.

"A room at the Garter Inn"

Falstaff is alone at the inn. Bardolfo and Pistola, now in the pay of Ford, enter and pretend to beg for forgiveness for past transgressions. They announce to their master the arrival of Mistress Quickly, who delivers an invitation to go to Alice's house that afternoon between the hours of two and three. She also delivers an answer from Meg Page and assures Falstaff that neither is aware of the other's letter. Falstaff celebrates his potential success ("Va, vecchio John" / "Go, old Jack, go your own way"). Ford arrives, masquerading as "Signor Fontana", supposedly an admirer of Alice; he offers money to the fat knight to seduce her. Falstaff is puzzled at the request, and "Fontana" explains that if Alice succumbs to Falstaff, it will then be easier for Fontana to overcome her virtuous scruples. Falstaff agrees with pleasure and reveals that he already has a rendezvous arranged with Alice for two o'clock – the hour when Ford is always absent from home. Falstaff goes off to change into his best clothes; Ford is consumed with jealousy ("È sogno o realtà?" / "Is it a dream or reality?"). When Falstaff returns in his finery, they leave together with elaborate displays of mutual courtesy.
"A room in Ford's house"

The three women plot their strategy ("Gaie Comari di Windsor" / "Merry wives of Windsor, the time has come!"). They are in high spirits, but Alice notices that Nannetta is not. This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius, a man old enough to be her grandfather; the women reassure her that they will prevent it. Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff's arrival, and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness. Falstaff's attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past glory ("Quand'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk" / "When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender") are cut short, as Mistress Quickly reports the impending arrival of Ford with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife's lover. Falstaff hides first behind the screen, and then the women hide him in the laundry basket. In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide behind the screen. The men hear the sound of a kiss behind it. They assume it is Falstaff with Alice, but instead they find the young lovers. Ford orders Fenton to leave. Inside the hamper Falstaff is almost suffocating. While the men resume the search of the house Alice orders her servants to throw the laundry basket through the window into the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, where Falstaff endures the jeers of the crowd.

"Before the inn"

Falstaff glumly curses the sorry state of the world. Some <a href="mulled%20wine">mulled wine</a> soon improves his mood. Mistress Quickly arrives and delivers another invitation to meet Alice. Falstaff at first wants nothing to do with it, but she persuades him. He is to meet Alice at midnight at Herne's Oak in <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a> dressed up as <a href="Herne%20the%20Hunter">Herne the Hunter</a>. He and Mistress Quickly go inside the inn. Ford has realised his error in suspecting his wife, and they and their allies have been watching secretly. They now concoct a plan for Falstaff's punishment: dressed as supernatural creatures, they will ambush and torment him at midnight. Ford privately proposes a separate plot to Caius: Nannetta will be disguised as Queen of the Fairies, Caius will wear a monk's costume, and Ford will join the two of them with a nuptial blessing. Mistress Quickly overhears and quietly vows to thwart Ford's scheme.

"Herne's Oak in Windsor Park on a moonlit midnight"

Fenton arrives at the oak tree and sings of his happiness ("Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" / "From my lips, a song of ecstasy flies") ending with "Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure." Nannetta enters to finish the line with "Indeed, they renew it, like the moon." The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk, telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford's and Caius's plans. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio" / "On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits") before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise. The joke is over, and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the "fait accompli" with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims in a fugue, which the entire company sings, that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun ("Tutto nel mondo è burla ... Tutti gabbati!" / "Everything in the world is a jest ...").

Verdi scored "Falstaff" for three <a href="western%20concert%20flute">flute</a>s (third doubling <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>), two <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s, <a href="English%20horn">English horn</a>, two <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s, <a href="bass%20clarinet">bass clarinet</a>, two <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s, four <a href="horn%20%28music%29">horns</a>, three <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s, four <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s, <a href="timpani">timpani</a>, percussion (<a href="triangle%20%28musical%20instrument%29">triangle</a>, <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s, <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>), <a href="harp">harp</a>, and <a href="string%20section">strings</a>. In addition, a <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="natural%20horn">natural horn</a>, and bell are heard from offstage. Unlike most of Verdi's earlier operatic scores, "Falstaff" is <a href="through-composed">through-composed</a>. No list of numbers is printed in the published full score. The score differs from much of Verdi's earlier work by having no overture: there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice (Dr Caius) enters. The critic <a href="Rodney%20Milnes">Rodney Milnes</a> comments that "enjoyment... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse, its effortless melody, its rhythmic vitality, and sureness of dramatic pace and construction." In "The New Grove Dictionary of Opera", Roger Parker writes that:

The opera was described by its creators as a "commedia lirica". McDonald commented in 2009 that "Falstaff" is very different – a stylistic departure – from Verdi's earlier work. In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and there is only one traditional aria. The result is that "such stylistic economy – more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work." McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: "the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 <a href="Imogen%20Holst">Imogen Holst</a>, musical assistant to <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, wrote, after a performance of "Falstaff", "I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are orchestral bits which are "just" as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in "<a href="Albert%20Herring">A. Herring</a>"!"

The extent to which "Falstaff" is a "Shakespearian" opera has often been debated by critics. Although the action is taken from "The Merry Wives of Windsor", some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano <a href="Elisabeth%20Schwarzkopf">Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</a> believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: "it was all done through the music". In 1961 <a href="Peter%20Heyworth">Peter Heyworth</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", "Because of Shakespeare we like to think of "Falstaff" as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>" is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of "<a href="opera%20buffa">opera buffa</a>"." Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian "buffo" character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the "Henry IV" plays: "My Falstaff is not merely the hero of "The Merry Wives of Windsor", who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of "Henry IV". Boito has written the libretto in accordance." A contemporary critic argued that the text "imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions.

Another recurrent question is how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by <a href="Wagner">Wagner</a>'s comic opera "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger">Die Meistersinger</a>". At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic <a href="Andrew%20Porter%20%28music%20critic%29">Andrew Porter</a> wrote, "That "Falstaff" was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's "Meistersinger" seems evident now. But the Italian "Falstaff" moves more quickly." Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring "Falstaff" into the regular operatic repertoire, commented:
Verdi scholars including <a href="Julian%20Budden">Julian Budden</a> have analysed the music in symphonic terms – the opening section "a perfect little <a href="sonata%20form">sonata</a> movement", the second act concluding with a variant of the classic slow <a href="concertante">concertante</a> ensemble leading to a fast <a href="stretto">stretto</a>, and the whole opera ending with "the most academic of musical forms", a fugue. Milnes suggests that this shows "a wise old conservative's warning about the excesses of the "<a href="verismo">verismo</a>" school of Italian opera" already on the rise by the 1890s. Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff's "honour" monologue, which concludes the first scene, and his reminiscent <a href="wikt%3Aarietta">arietta</a> ("Quand'ero paggio") about himself as a young page. The young lovers, Nannetta and Fenton, are given a lyrical and playful duet ("Labbra di foco") in Act I; in Act III, Fenton's impassioned love song, "Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" briefly becomes a duet when Nannetta joins him. She then has the last substantial solo section of the score, the "fairy" aria, "Sul fil d'un soffio etesio", described by Parker as "yet another aria suffused with the soft orchestral colours that characterize this scene".

The score is seen by the critic Richard Osborne as rich in self-parody, with sinister themes from "<a href="Rigoletto">Rigoletto</a>" and "<a href="Un%20ballo%20in%20maschera">Un ballo in maschera</a>" transmuted into comedy. For Osborne the nocturnal music of Act III draws on the examples of <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Weber</a>, <a href="Berlioz">Berlioz</a> and <a href="Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, creating a mood akin to that of Shakespeare's "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>". Osborne views the whole opera as an ensemble piece, and he comments that grand soliloquy in the old Verdian style is reserved for Ford's "jealousy" aria in Act II, which is almost tragic in style but comic in effect, making Ford "a figure to be laughed at." Osborne concludes his analysis, ""Falstaff" is comedy's musical apogee: the finest opera, inspired by the finest dramatist, by the finest opera composer the world has known".

There are two early recordings of Falstaff's short arietta "Quand'ero paggio". Pini Corsi, the original Ford, recorded it in 1904, and Maurel followed in 1907. The first recording of the complete opera was made by Italian Columbia in March and April 1932. It was conducted by <a href="Lorenzo%20Molajoli">Lorenzo Molajoli</a> with the chorus and orchestra of La Scala, and a cast including <a href="Giacomo%20Rimini">Giacomo Rimini</a> as Falstaff and <a href="Pia%20Tassinari">Pia Tassinari</a> as Alice. Some live stage performances were recorded in the 1930s, but the next studio recording was that conducted by Toscanini for broadcast by <a href="NBC">NBC</a> in 1950, released on disc by <a href="RCA">RCA</a>. The first <a href="stereophonic">stereophonic</a> recording was conducted by Herbert von Karajan for <a href="EMI%20Classics">EMI</a> in 1956.
