Early life of Samuel Johnson

<a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. He was a sickly infant who early on began to exhibit the <a href="tic">tic</a>s that would influence how people viewed him in his later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.

After a year spent studying at <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Oxford">Pembroke College, Oxford</a>, Johnson was forced to leave by lack of financial support. He tried to find employment as a teacher, but was unable to secure a long-term position. In 1735 he married <a href="Elizabeth%20Porter%20%28died%201752%29">Elizabeth "Tetty" Porter</a>, a widow 20 years older than himself, and the responsibilities of this marriage made him determined to succeed as an educator. He established his own school, but the venture was unsuccessful. Thereafter, leaving his wife behind in Lichfield, he moved to London, where he spent the rest of his life. In London he began writing essays for "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>", and also befriended <a href="Richard%20Savage%20%28poet%29">Richard Savage</a>, a notorious rake and aspiring poet who claimed to be the disavowed son of a nobleman. Eventually he wrote the "<a href="Life%20of%20Mr%20Richard%20Savage">Life of Mr Richard Savage</a>", his first successful <a href="Biography%20in%20literature">literary biography</a>. He also wrote the powerful poem "<a href="London%20%281738%20poem%29">London</a>", an 18th-century version of "", as well as the tragic drama "<a href="Irene%20%28play%29">Irene</a>", which was not produced until 1749, and even then was not successful.

Johnson began his literary career as a minor <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> <a href="hack%20writer">hack writer</a>, but he went on to make lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, <a href="moral%20philosophy">moralist</a>, novelist, <a href="literary%20critic">literary critic</a>, biographer, editor and <a href="lexicographer">lexicographer</a>. His early works, especially "London" and "Life of Mr Richard Savage", contain Johnson's emerging views on biography, morality, and literature in general.

Johnson's parents were Michael Johnson, a bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Ford. Michael was the first bookseller of reputation in the <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> community of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>. He also owned a <a href="parchment">parchment</a> factory, which allowed him to produce his own books. Little is known of his background, except that he and his brothers were apprenticed as booksellers. Michael's father, William Johnson, was described as a "yeoman" and a "gentleman" in the Stationers' Company records, but there is little evidence to suggest that he was from a noble family. William was the first Johnson to move to Lichfield and died shortly thereafter. Michael Johnson, after leaving his apprenticeship at 24, followed in his father's footsteps and took up a job selling books on Sadler Street, Lichfield. Three years later Michael Johnson became warden of a charity known as the Conduit Lands Trust, and shortly afterwards was made churchwarden of St Mary's church.

At the age of 29, Michael Johnson was engaged to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she cancelled the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.

Johnson was born in Lichfield at 4:00 pm on Wednesday, 18 September 1709 at the <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%20Birthplace%20Museum">family home</a> above his father's bookshop, near Market Square, across from <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Lichfield">St Mary's Church</a>. His mother was 40 when she gave birth, a matter for sufficient concern that George Hector, a "man-midwife" and a surgeon of "great reputation", was brought in to assist during the birth. The baby was named Samuel, after Sarah's brother Samuel Ford. He did not cry and, with doubts surrounding the newborn's health, his aunt claimed "that she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street". As it was feared the baby might die, the vicar of St Mary's was summoned to perform a baptism. Two godfathers were chosen: Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of Pembroke College, and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner, and Lichfield town clerk.

Johnson's health improved and he was placed in the nursing care of Joan Marklew. During this period he contracted what is believed to have been <a href="scrofula">scrofula</a>, known at that time as the "King's Evil". <a href="John%20Floyer%20%28physician%29">Sir John Floyer</a>, a former physician to <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a>, recommended that the young Johnson should receive the "<a href="royal%20touch">royal touch</a>", which he received from <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> on 30 March 1712 at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>. Johnson was given a ribbon in memory of the event, which he claimed to have worn for the rest of his life. However, the ritual was ineffective and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scarring across his face and body. Sarah later gave birth to a second boy, Nathaniel. Having two children put financial strain on the family; Michael was unable to keep on top of the debts he had accumulated over the years, and his family was no longer able to maintain the lifestyle it had previously enjoyed.

Johnson demonstrated signs of great intelligence as a child, and his parents, to his later disgust, took pleasure in showing off his "newly acquired accomplishments". His education began at the age of three, when his mother had him memorise and recite passages from the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>. When Johnson turned four, he was sent to a nearby "school" on Dam Street, where "Dame" Anne Oliver, the proprietor, gave lessons to young children in the living-room of a cottage. Johnson especially enjoyed his time with Dame Oliver, later remembering her fondly. At the age of six he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education, and a year later was enrolled at <a href="Lichfield%20Grammar%20School">Lichfield Grammar School</a>; he excelled in Latin under Humphrey Hawkins, his teacher in the lower school.
During this time Johnson began exhibiting the <a href="tic">tic</a>s that would influence how others viewed him in his later years, and which formed the basis for his posthumous diagnosis of <a href="Tourette%20syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> (TS). TS develops in childhood; it follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven. Johnson's tics and gesticulations manifested after his childhood scrofula; studies suggest that <a href="Natural%20environment">environmental</a> and infectious factors—while not causing Tourette's—can affect the severity of the disorder. Pearce describes Johnson's birth as a "very difficult and dangerous labour", and adds that Johnson had many illnesses throughout his life: he "suffered from bouts of melancholy, crushing guilt, habitual insomnia, and he endured a morbid fear of loneliness and of dying." He also was "disturbed by <a href="intrusive%20thoughts">scruples of infidelity</a>" from the age of 10.

Although TS caused problems in his private and public life, it lent Johnson "great verbal and vocal energy". He excelled in his education and was promoted to the upper school at the age of nine, to be tutored by Edward Holbrooke. The school was directed by the Reverend John Hunter, a man known for his scholarship and, like Holbrooke, his brutality, which caused Johnson to become dissatisfied with his education. However, during this time he did befriend Edmund Hector, nephew of his "man-midwife" George Hector, and John Taylor, both of whom he remained in contact with throughout his life.

At the age of 16, Johnson was given the opportunity to stay with his cousins, the Fords, at <a href="Pedmore">Pedmore</a>, Worcestershire. There he bonded with Cornelius Ford, the son of his mother's brother, and Ford employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Johnson enjoyed his time with Ford, who encouraged Johnson to pursue his studies and to become a <a href="intellectual">man of letters</a>. Johnson remembered one moment of Ford's teachings: Ford told him to "grasp the leading praecognita of all things... grasps the trunk hard only, and you will shake all the branches". Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, familiar with many society figures such as <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>.

Ford was also a notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit. This event deeply affected Johnson, and he remembered Ford in his "Life of Fenton", saying that Ford's abilities, "instead of furnishing convivial merriments to the voluptuous and dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise". Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, "angered by the impertinence of this long absence", refused to allow him to continue at the grammar school.
Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, with the help of Ford and his half-brother Gregory Hickman, into the <a href="King%20Edward%20VI%20College%2C%20Stourbridge">King Edward VI Grammar School</a> at <a href="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a>. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his "<a href="Life%20of%20Samuel%20Johnson">Life of Samuel Johnson</a>", he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, "She was the first woman with whom I was in love. It dropped out of my head imperceptibly, but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other."

Johnson's future now began to look uncertain, as his father was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson stitched books for his father, although poor eyesight—a result of his childhood illness—meant he eschewed the work involved. It is possible that Johnson spent most of his time in his father's bookshop reading various works and building his literary knowledge. During this time, Johnson met Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court and a frequent visitor to the bookshop. Walmesley took a liking to Johnson, and the two discussed various intellectual topics during the two years Johnson spent working in the shop. Their relationship was soon put on hold; Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left her £40 (about £ as of ), which was used to send Johnson back to school.

On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Oxford">Pembroke College, Oxford</a> as a fellow-commoner. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.
On the day of Johnson's entrance interview for Pembroke, his anxious father introduced him to his future tutor, William Jorden, hoping to make an impression. During the interview, his father was "very full of the merits of his son, and told the company he was a good scholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verses", which caused Johnson significant embarrassment. Michael's praise was unnecessary; Johnson's interview went so well that one of the interviewers, a 26-year-old <a href="William%20Adams%20%28master%29">William Adams</a> (Jorden's cousin, later Master of Pembroke), claimed that Johnson was "the best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there". Throughout the interview, Johnson sat quietly while listening to his father and the interviewers, until he interrupted and quoted <a href="Macrobius">Macrobius</a>. The interviewers were surprised that "a School-boy should know Macrobius", and he was accepted immediately.

At Pembroke, Johnson made many friends, but neglected many of the mandatory lectures, and ignored calls for poems. He did complete one poem, the first of his tutorial exercises, on which he spent comparable time, and which provoked surprise and applause. He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin translation of <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>'s <a href="Messiah%20%28English%20poem%29">"Messiah"</a> as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem was brought to Pope's attention; according to Sir John Hawkins, Pope claimed that he could not tell if it was the original or not. However, Johnson's friend John Taylor dismissed this "praise" because Johnson's father had already published the translation before Johnson sent a copy to Pope, and Pope could have been remarking about it being a duplication of the published edition.
Regardless, Pope remarked that the work was very finely done, but that did not prevent Johnson from being violently angry at his father's actions in preempting his sending Pope a copy of the poem. The poem later appeared in "Miscellany of Poems" (1731), edited by John Husbands, a Pembroke tutor, and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnson's writings. Johnson spent the rest of his time studying, even over the Christmas vacation. He drafted a "plan of study" called "Adversaria", which was left unfinished, and used his time to learn French while working on his knowledge of Greek.

Although he later praised Jorden, Johnson came to odds with him over what he considered to be Jorden's "meanness" of abilities. He discouraged his friend Taylor, who came to Pembroke in March, from having Jorden as his tutor, and Taylor was soon encouraged to go to <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a> to be taught by Edmund Bateman. Johnson appreciated Bateman's skill as a lecturer, and he would often travel to meet Taylor to discuss the lectures. However, Johnson lacked the funds to even replace his shoes, and so he started to make the journey barefoot. In response, those of Christ Church began to mock Johnson, and he soon kept to his own room for the rest of his time at Pembroke, with Taylor visiting him instead.

After thirteen months, poverty forced Johnson to leave Oxford without taking a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.

There is little record of Johnson's life between the end of 1729 and 1731; he most likely lived with his parents when experiencing bouts of mental anguish and physical pains. After these years of illness, his tics and <a href="gesticulation">gesticulation</a>s associated with TS became more noticeable and were "commented on by many observers". To further complicate Johnson's life, his father was deeply in debt by 1731 and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. An usher's position became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but Johnson's lack of a degree saw him passed over, on 6 September 1731. Instead, he stayed at the home of Gregory Hickman, Cornelius Ford's half brother, writing poetry. It was there that he heard the devastating news that Cornelius had died in London, on 22 August 1731; later, in his personal "Annales", he pointed to that moment as one of the most important of his life.

At about the same time, Johnson's father became ill; he developed an "inflammatory fever" by the end of the year. He died in December 1731 and was buried at <a href="St%20Michael%20on%20Greenhill%2C%20Lichfield">St Michael on Greenhill, Lichfield</a> on 7 December 1731. He left no will, and Johnson received only £20 from Michael's estate of £60 (£ as of ). In an act "almost like religious penance", Johnson honoured his father's memory 50 years later by returning to his bookstall in <a href="Uttoxeter">Uttoxeter</a> to make amends for his refusal to work the stall while his father lay dying. Richard Warner kept Johnson's account of the scene:
Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in <a href="Market%20Bosworth">Market Bosworth</a>, <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>. He was paid £20 a year (£ as of ), enough to support himself. The school was run by <a href="Sir%20Wolstan%20Dixie%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir Wolstan Dixie, 4th Baronet</a>, who allowed Johnson to teach even though he did not have a degree. The unconventional Dixie allowed Johnson to live in his own mansion, <a href="Bosworth%20Hall%20%28Market%20Bosworth%29">Bosworth Hall</a>. Although the arrangement may seem congenial, Johnson was treated as "a kind of domestick chaplain, so far, at least, as to say grace at table, but was treated with what he represented as intolerable harshness; and, after suffering for a few months such complicated misery, he relinquished a situation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the strongest aversion, and even a degree of horrour". Still, Johnson found pleasure in teaching even though he thought it boring. By June 1732, he had returned home, and, after a fight with Dixie, quit the school.

Johnson spent the rest of his time at Lichfield looking for a position at the other local schools, and, after being turned down for a position in <a href="Ashbourne%2C%20Derbyshire">Ashbourne, Derbyshire</a>, he spent his time with his friend, Hector. Hector lived in the home of <a href="Thomas%20Warren">Thomas Warren</a>, on High Street, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, and Johnson was invited to stay there as a guest in the autumn of 1732. Warren was at that time starting his "<a href="Birmingham%20Journal%20%28eighteenth%20century%29">Birmingham Journal</a>", and he enlisted Johnson's help, although no copies of the essays he wrote for the paper now survive. His stay with Hector and Warren was not to last, and Johnson moved into the house of a man named Jarvis on 1 June 1733. During this time, Johnson started to slip into a "state of 'absence and he began to treat his friends with "abuse".

His connection with Warren continued to grow, and Johnson proposed to translate <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20Lobo">Jerónimo Lobo</a>'s account of the Abyssinians. Johnson read Abbe Joachim Le Grand's French translations, and he thought that a shorter version might be "useful and profitable". He began work on the edition and a finished section was taken to be printed during the winter of 1733–1734. Johnson's nerves got the best of him, and after a breakdown he was unable to continue working, but felt obligated to meet his contract. To finish the rest, Johnson dictated directly to Hector, who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections. It amounted to a month's work, and, a year later, his "A Voyage to Abyssinia" was finally published.

Johnson returned to Lichfield in February 1734, where he began an annotated edition of <a href="Poliziano">Poliziano</a>'s Latin poems, along with a history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano. The work was designed to fill 480 pages and provide a detailed commentary and corresponding notes. By completing such a work as this, Johnson hoped to become known as a scholar-poet similar to <a href="Julius%20Caesar%20Scaliger">Julius Caesar Scaliger</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Heinsius">Daniel</a> and <a href="Nikolaes%20Heinsius%20the%20Elder">Nikolaes Heinsius</a>, <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Desiderius Erasmus</a>, and Poliziano, all of whom Johnson admired. Johnson began on 15 June 1743 and printed a "Proposal" for the work on 5 August 1734. However, the project did not receive enough funds and it was soon brought to an end. Although the project failed, it shows that Johnson identified himself with <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">neo-Latin humanism</a>.

Johnson identified himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to <a href="Edward%20Cave">Edward Cave</a> to work on the poetry reviews for "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>". In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, "As You appear no less sensible than Your Readers of the defects of your Poetical Article, You will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to You the sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's "low Jests" and "awkward Buffoonery" and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.

Around this time, Johnson became close to a man named Harry Porter, and remained with him during his terminal illness. Porter died on 3 September 1734, leaving his wife <a href="Elizabeth%20Porter%20%28died%201752%29">Elizabeth</a> ("<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" Jervis, and nicknamed "Tetty") widowed at the age of 45, with three children. Months later, Johnson began to court the widow; Reverend <a href="William%20Shaw%20%28Gaelic%20scholar%29">William Shaw</a> claims that "the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations". Johnson and Elizabeth became close, and they quickly fell in love. She admired Johnson greatly and claimed that he was "the most sensible man that I ever saw in my life".

Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and provided for him with her substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at <a href="St%20Werburgh%27s%20Church%2C%20Derby">St Werburgh's Church</a> in <a href="Derby">Derby</a>. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.

During the previous June while working as a tutor for Thomas Whitby's children, Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at <a href="Solihull%20School">Solihull School</a>. Walmesley lent his support to Johnson's application, but Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was "a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gent[s] think it may affect some lads". He was also rejected for a position at a school in <a href="Brewood">Brewood</a> for similar reasons. Johnson did not give up his ambition to teach; with Walmesley's encouragement, he decided to set up his own school.
In the autumn of 1735, Johnson opened a <a href="Edial%20Hall%20School">private academy</a> at <a href="Edial">Edial</a>, near Lichfield. The building, Edial Hall, was a large house with a pyramid-shaped roof and a unique design; a back room served as the schoolroom while the rest housed Johnson's family. He had only three pupils, <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>, George Garrick and Lawrence Offley; David Garrick—18 at the time—went on to become one of the most famous actors of his day. Johnson designed a curriculum that focused on the reading of classical literature, starting with what he considered to be easier works, such as those by <a href="Corderius">Corderius</a> and Erasmus, before slowly progressing to <a href="Cornelius%20Nepos">Cornelius Nepos</a> and finally onto <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="Vergil">Vergil</a>, and <a href="Horace">Horace</a>. The school was advertised in the June and July 1736 editions of "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>": "At Edial, near Litchfield, in Staffordshire, Young Gentlemen are Boarded, and Taught the Latin and Greek Languages, by Samuel Johnson".

After being open for little more than a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a reputation as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy "<a href="Irene%20%28play%29">Irene</a>". The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.
On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson received word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish "Irene". During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for <a href="Paolo%20Sarpi">Paolo Sarpi</a>'s "The History of the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>" (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.

Johnson started working on the translation of Sarpi before Cave approved, and he returned home to his wife during this time. In all, he managed to write between four hundred and eight hundred pages of text with corresponding commentary before he stopped working on it in April 1739. In October 1737, Johnson brought his wife to London; they first lived at Woodstock Street and then moved to 6 Castle Street. Soon, Johnson found employment with Cave, and wrote for his "The Gentleman's Magazine". His work for the magazine and other publishers during this time "is almost unparalleled in range and variety", and "so numerous, so varied and scattered" that "Johnson himself could not make a complete list".
In May 1738, his first major work, a poem called "<a href="London%20%281738%20poem%29">London</a>", was published anonymously. The work was based on <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>'s and describes the character Thales's leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London. In particular, the poem describes how London is a place of crime, corruption, and the neglect of the poor. Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as granting him any merit as a poet; however, Alexander Pope claimed that the author "will soon be déterré" (brought to light, become well known), although it did not immediately happen.

In August, Johnson was denied a position as master of the Appleby Grammar School because a master's degree from Oxford or Cambridge was required. To ensure that he would not suffer rejection again, Pope asked <a href="John%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Earl%20Gower">John Gower</a>, a man with influence in the <a href="Appleby%20Magna">Appleby</a> community, to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower attempted to have a degree awarded to Johnson from Oxford, but he was told that it was "too much to be asked." Gower then wrote to a friend of <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> to persuade him to use his influence at the <a href="University%20of%20Dublin">University of Dublin</a> to have a masters awarded to Johnson, which could then be used to justify a masters awarded to Johnson from Oxford. However, Swift refused to act on Johnson's behalf. Regardless of Swift's motivation in not acting on Johnson's behalf, or how Johnson reacted to Swift's actions, it is known that Johnson then after refused to appreciate Swift as a poet, writer, or a satirist, with one exception: Swift's "<a href="Tale%20of%20a%20Tub">Tale of a Tub</a>", of which Johnson doubted Swift's authorship.

Between 1737 and 1739, Johnson became close to <a href="Richard%20Savage%20%28poet%29">Richard Savage</a>. Feeling guilty for his own poverty, Johnson stopped living with his wife and spent time with Savage. Together, they would roam the streets at night without enough money to stay in taverns or sleep in "night-cellars". Savage was both a poet and a playwright, and Johnson was reported to enjoy spending time and discussing various topics with him, along with drinking and other merriment. However, poverty eventually caught up with Savage, and Pope, along with Savage's other friends, gave him an "annual pension" in return for him agreeing to move to Wales. Savage ended up in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> however, and once again fell into debt by reliving his former London lifestyle. He was soon in debtors' prison and died in 1743. A year later, Johnson wrote "<a href="Life%20of%20Mr%20Richard%20Savage">Life of Mr Richard Savage</a>" (1744) at Cave's prompting, and this work formed the beginning of Johnson's long-lasting success. The biography was a "moving" work that, according to <a href="Walter%20Jackson%20Bate">Walter Jackson Bate</a>, "remains one of the innovative works in the history of biography".

Johnson's early works and early life have been neglected topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily known for the events surrounding his later life and later works like "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">A Dictionary of the English Language</a>". This imbalance originates in the failure of <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a>, Johnson's friend and companion, to discuss in great detail Johnson's childhood and the beginning of his career within the "<a href="Life%20of%20Samuel%20Johnson">Life of Samuel Johnson</a>", the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%27s%20politics">early politics and political writings</a> which show a concern with <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a>'s political administration.

His first major work, the poem "London", contains an early version of Johnson's <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%27s%20ethical%20views">ethics and morality</a> system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, "London" is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.

Johnson's first major success came with "Life of Savage", but it was not his first biography; Savage was the fourth in a series which also included biographies of <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Baratier">Jean-Philippe Baratier</a>, <a href="Robert%20Blake%20%28admiral%29">Robert Blake</a> and <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>. Although it was not the only biography that appeared immediately after Savage's death, it became the most popular, and it embodied Johnson's ideas on what a biography should be.

The book did contain some inaccuracies, particularly those surrounding Savage's claim that he was the illegitimate child of a nobleman. It was successful in its partial analysis of Savage's poetry and in portraying insights into Savage's personality, but for all of its literary achievements it did not bring immediate fame or income to Johnson or to Cave; it did, though, provide Johnson with a welcome small income at an opportune time in his life. More importantly, the work helped to mould Johnson into a biographical career; it was included in his later "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Eminent%20English%20Poets">Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets</a>" series.

Action of 13 January 1797

The Action of 13 January 1797 was a minor naval battle fought between a French <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> and two British <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s off the coast of <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French vessel and drove it onto shore in heavy seas, resulting in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300 persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a <a href="lee%20shore">lee shore</a>.

The French 74-gun ship <a href="French%20ship%20Droits%20de%20l%27Homme%20%281794%29">"Droits de l'Homme"</a> had been part of the "<a href="Exp%C3%A9dition%20d%27Irlande">Expédition d'Irlande</a>", an unsuccessful attempt by a French expeditionary force to invade Ireland. During the operation, the French fleet was beset by poor coordination and violent weather, eventually being compelled to return to France without landing a single soldier. Two British frigates, the 44-gun and the 36-gun , had been ordered to patrol the seas off <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> in an attempt to intercept the returning French force and sighted the "Droits de l'Homme" on the afternoon of 13 January.

The engagement lasted for more than 15 hours, in an increasing gale and the constant presence of the rocky Breton coast. The seas were so rough that the French ship was unable to open the lower gun ports during the action and as a result could only fire the upper deck guns, significantly reducing the advantage that a ship of the line would normally have over the smaller frigates. The damage the more manoeuvrable British vessels inflicted on the French ship was so severe that as the winds increased, the French crew lost control and the "Droits de l'Homme" was swept onto a sandbar and destroyed.

In December 1796, during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, a French expeditionary force departed from <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> on an expedition to invade Ireland. This army of 18,000 French soldiers was intended to link up with the secret organisation of <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalists</a> known as the <a href="United%20Irishmen">United Irishmen</a> and provoke a widespread uprising throughout the island. It was hoped that the resulting war would force Britain to make peace with the <a href="First%20French%20Republic">French Republic</a> or risk losing control of Ireland altogether. Led by Vice-Admiral <a href="Justin%20Bonaventure%20Morard%20de%20Galles">Morard de Galles</a>, General <a href="Lazare%20Hoche">Lazare Hoche</a> and leader of the United Irishmen <a href="Wolfe%20Tone">Wolfe Tone</a>, the invasion fleet included 17 ships of the line, 27 smaller warships and transports, and carried extensive <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>, cavalry and military stores to equip the Irish irregular forces they hoped to raise.

Morard de Galles planned to sail his fleet from the French naval fortress of Brest under cover of darkness on the night of 15–16 December. The British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> normally maintained a squadron off Brest to <a href="naval%20blockade">blockade</a> the port, but its commander, Rear-Admiral <a href="John%20Colpoys">John Colpoys</a>, had withdrawn his force from its usual station offshore to northwest of Brest because of severe <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> winter <a href="gale">gale</a>s. The only British ships within sight of Brest were an inshore squadron of frigates under <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Sir Edward Pellew</a> in , accompanied by , , and the <a href="lugger">lugger</a> HMS "Duke of York". Pellew was already renowned, having been the first British officer of the war to capture a French frigate: the <a href="French%20frigate%20Cl%C3%A9op%C3%A2tre">"Cléopâtre"</a> at the <a href="Action%20of%2018%20June%201793">Action of 18 June 1793</a>. He later captured the frigates <a href="French%20frigate%20Pomone%20%281787%29">"Pomone"</a> and <a href="French%20frigate%20Virginie%20%281794%29">"Virginie"</a> in 1794 and 1796, and saved 500 lives following the shipwreck of the <a href="East%20Indiaman">East Indiaman</a> "Dutton" in January 1796. For these actions he had first been <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> and then raised to a <a href="baronetcy">baronetcy</a>. "Indefatigable" was a <a href="razee">razee</a>, one of the largest frigates in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, originally constructed as a 64-gun <a href="third%20rate">third rate</a> and cut down to 44 guns in 1795 to make the ship fast and powerful enough to catch and fight the largest of French frigates. Armed with <a href="24-pounder%20long%20gun">24-pounder cannon</a> on the main decks and 42-pounder <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s on the quarter deck, she had a stronger armament than any equivalent French frigate.
Observing the French fleet's departure from the harbour at dusk, Pellew immediately dispatched "Phoebe" to Colpoys and "Amazon" to the main fleet at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> with warnings, before approaching the entrance to Brest in "Indefatigable" with the intention of disrupting French movements. Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force, de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the <a href="Raz%20de%20Sein">Raz de Sein</a>. This channel was a narrow, rocky and dangerous passage, and de Galles used <a href="corvettes">corvettes</a> as temporary <a href="light%20ships">light ships</a> that shone blue lights and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage. Pellew observed this, and sailed "Indefatigable" right through the French fleet, launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random. This succeeded in confusing the French officers, causing the <a href="French%20ship%20S%C3%A9duisant%20%281783%29">"Séduisant"</a> to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1,300. "Séduisant"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s distress flares added to the confusion and delayed the fleet's passage until dawn. His task of observing the enemy completed, Pellew took his remaining squadron to <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth</a>, sent a report to the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> by <a href="semaphore%20line">semaphore telegraph</a>, and refitted his ships.

During December 1796 and early January 1797, the French army repeatedly attempted to land in Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate <a href="French%20frigate%20Agla%C3%A9%20%281788%29">"Fraternité"</a> carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at <a href="Mizen%20Head">Mizen Head</a>. Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Joseph%20Bouvet">Bouvet</a> and General <a href="Emmanuel%20de%20Grouchy%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Grouchy">Grouchy</a> decided to attempt the landing at <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a> without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For more than a week the fleet waited for a break in the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29 December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to land at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Shannon">River Shannon</a>, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11 ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.

By 13 January most of the survivors of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun <a href="French%20ship%20Droits%20de%20l%27Homme%20%281794%29">"Droits de l'Homme"</a>, was commanded by Commodore <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Raymond%20de%20Lacrosse">Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse</a> and carried over 1,300 men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General <a href="Jean%20Joseph%20Amable%20Humbert">Jean Humbert</a>. Detached from the main body of the fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British <a href="privateer">privateer</a> "Cumberland" en route.

Pellew too was on his way back to Brest in "Indefatigable", accompanied by "Amazon" under the command of Captain <a href="Robert%20Carthew%20Reynolds">Robert Carthew Reynolds</a>. While the rest of the Channel Fleet had been pursuing the French without success, Pellew had had his ships refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so that both frigates were at full complement, well armed and prepared for action. At 13:00 on 13 January, the British ships were approaching the island of <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> in a heavy fog when they spied another ship through the gloom ahead. This ship, clearly much larger than either of the British vessels, was the "Droits de l'Homme". At the same time, lookouts on the French ship spotted the British, and Lacrosse was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage the enemy. He knew that his ship was far larger than either of his opponents, but had earlier spotted sails to westwards he believed to be British and thus considered himself outnumbered and possibly surrounded. British records show that no other British vessels were in the vicinity at the time and it is likely that Lacrosse had seen the French ships <a href="French%20ship%20Th%C3%A9s%C3%A9e%20%281790%29">"Révolution"</a> and "Fraternité" returning to Brest from Bantry Bay. In addition, Lacrosse was concerned by the increasing gale and rocky lee shoreline, which posed a considerable threat to his over-laden vessel, which was already damaged from its winter voyage and carried a <a href="demi-brigade">demi-brigade</a> of the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> and Humbert, neither of which could be placed at risk in an inconsequential naval action.

Determined to avoid battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping to use his wider spread of sail to outrun his opponent in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the "Droits de l'Homme" off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure of the nature of his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of "Droits de l'Homme"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with "Droits de l'Homme".

Pellew was aware that his frigate was heavily outclassed by his much larger opponent, and that "Amazon", which was distant, was not large enough to redress the balance when it did arrive. He correctly assumed, however, that the ocean was too rough to allow Lacrosse to open his lower <a href="gunport">gunport</a>s without the risk that heavy waves would enter them and cause "Droits de l'Homme" to founder. In fact, the French ship was totally unable to open her lower deck gunports during the action: an unusual design feature had the ports lower than was normal and as a result the sea poured in at any attempt to open them, preventing any gunnery at all from the lower deck and halving the ship's firepower. Although this reduced the number of available guns on the French vessel, Lacrosse still held the advantage in terms of size, weight of shot and manpower. The French situation was worsened however by the loss of the topmasts: this caused their ship to roll so severely in the high seas that it was far more difficult both to steer the ship and to aim the guns than on the British vessels.

To the surprise of Lacrosse and his officers, "Indefatigable" did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to <a href="Windward%20and%20leeward">leeward</a> as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of "Droits de l'Homme" and opened a <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a>. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of <a href="musket">musket</a> fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of "Droits de l'Homme" and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram "Indefatigable". Neither manoeuvre was successful, as "Droits de l'Homme" raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.

"Indefatigable" and "Droits de l'Homme" manoeuvred around one another, exchanging fire when possible until 18:45, when "Amazon" arrived. During this exchange, one of "Droits de l'Homme"s <a href="cannon">cannon</a> burst, causing heavy casualties on her packed deck. Approaching the larger French ship with all sail spread, Reynolds closed to within pistol shot before raking "Droits de l'Homme". Lacrosse responded to this new threat by manoeuvring to bring both British ships to face the westward side of his ship, avoiding becoming trapped in a <a href="crossfire">crossfire</a>. The battle continued until 19:30, when both "Amazon" and "Indefatigable" pulled away from their opponent to make hasty repairs. By 20:30, the frigates had returned to the much slower French ship and began weaving in front of "Droits de l'Homme"s bow, repeatedly raking her. Lacrosse's increasingly desperate attempts to ram the British ships were all unsuccessful and what little cannon fire he did manage to deploy was ineffectual, as the rolling of the ship of the line prevented reliable aiming.

By 22:30, "Droits de l'Homme" was in severe difficulties, with heavy casualties among her crew and passengers and the loss of her <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mizzenmast</a> to British fire. Observing the battered state of their opponent, Pellew and Reynolds closed on the stern quarters of the French ship, maintaining a high rate of fire that was sporadically returned by "Droits de l'Homme". Having exhausted the 4,000 <a href="wikt%3Acannonball">cannonballs</a> available, Lacrosse was forced to use the <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a> he was carrying, which had been intended for use by the army in Ireland. In the high winds, these proved even less effective than solid shot, but did drive the frigates to longer range. With their opponent almost immobilised, the British frigates were able to remain outside her arc of fire, effect repairs when necessary and secure guns that had broken loose in the heavy seas. For the rest of the night the three battered ships remained locked in a close range duel, until suddenly, at 04:20 while it was still dark, land was spotted just to leeward by Lieutenant George Bell of the "Indefatigable".

Pellew immediately turned seawards in an effort to escape the shore and signalled Reynolds to follow suit. Although both ships had suffered severe damage from the battle and weather, they were able to make the turn away from land, "Amazon" to the north and "Indefatigable", at the insistence of its <a href="Breton%20people">Breton</a> <a href="Maritime%20pilot">pilot</a>, to the south. Initially it was believed that the land spotted was the island of Ushant, which would have given the ships plenty of sea-room in which to manoeuvre. However at 06:30, with the sky lightening, it became apparent on the "Indefatigable" that there were breakers to the south and east, indicating that the three ships had drifted during the night into <a href="Audierne">Audierne Bay</a>. On discovering his situation, Pellew was determined to bring his ship westwards, attempting to work his ship out of danger by <a href="Tacking%20%28sailing%29%23Beating">beating against the wind</a>. Hasty repairs had to be made to the damaged rigging before it was safe to alter their course. Due to her northwards turn, "Amazon" had even less room to manoeuvre than "Indefatigable" and by 05:00 she had struck a sandbank. Although the frigate remained upright, attempts over several hours to bring her off failed; at 08:00 Reynolds ordered his men to prepare to <a href="wikt%3Aabandon%20ship">abandon ship</a>.

"Droits de l'Homme" had been more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's foremast and <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> collapsed under the pressure of the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the "Droits de l'Homme" struck a sandbank close to the town of <a href="Ploz%C3%A9vet">Plozévet</a>. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.

As daylight broke over Audierne Bay, crowds of locals gathered on the beach. The "Droits de l'Homme" lay on her side directly opposite the town of Plozévet, with large waves breaking over her hull; to the north, "Amazon" stood upright on a sandbar, her crew launching boats in an effort to reach the shore, while "Indefatigable" was the only ship still afloat, rounding the <a href="Penmarck%20rocks">Penmarck rocks</a> at the southern edge of the bay at 11:00. On board the "Amazon", Reynolds maintained discipline and gave orders to launch the ship's boats in an orderly fashion and to build rafts in which to bring the entire crew safely to shore. Six men disobeyed his command, stole a <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launch</a>, and attempted to reach the shore alone, but were swept away by the current. Their boat was capsized by the waves, and all six drowned. The remaining crew, including those wounded in the previous night's action, were safely brought ashore by 09:00, where they were made <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> by the French authorities.

"Droits de l'Homme" was irreparably damaged, and many of the men on board were soldiers with no training for what to do in the event of a shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea. With no aid possible from the shore, night fell on 14 January with most of the crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15 January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the "Cumberland", captured by "Droits de l'Homme" earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.

By the morning of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft carrying the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, and at least one officer drowned in a desperate attempt to swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17 January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval <a href="brig">brig</a>, the "Arrogante". This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the <a href="cutter%20%28ship%29">cutter</a> "Aiguille".

On the "Droits de l'Homme", many survivors were too weak to reach the boats, and a number of men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many more could not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17 January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140 survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The <a href="the%20captain%20goes%20down%20with%20the%20ship">last two people to leave the ship</a> were the commanders <a href="Jean%20Joseph%20Amable%20Humbert">General Humbert</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Raymond%20de%20Lacrosse">Commodore Lacrosse</a>. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the "Cumberland" were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts to save lives from the shipwreck.

Exact French casualties are difficult to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard "Droits de l'Homme", 103 are known to have died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900 men on the French ship between the morning of 14 January and the morning of 18 January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette "Arrogante" and the cutter "Aiguille" on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A <a href="menhir">menhir</a> at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.

"Amazon" lost three in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while "Indefatigable" did not lose a single man killed, suffering only 18 wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.

Reynolds and his officers were exchanged for French prisoners some weeks later, and in the routine <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> investigating the loss of their ship were honourably acquitted "with every sentiment of the court's highest approbation." Reynolds was subsequently appointed to the large frigate . The senior lieutenants of each frigate were promoted to commander and head money (<a href="prize%20money">prize money</a> based on the number of the enemy's crew and awarded when the defeated ship was destroyed) was distributed among the crews. Pellew remained in command of "Indefatigable" off Brest for another year and seized a number of French merchant ships. He was later promoted several times, and by the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in 1815 had become Lord Exmouth, Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Reynolds did not survive the war, dying in the wreck of in 1811. Lacrosse and Humbert were not censured for the loss of their ship: the commodore was promoted to admiral and later became ambassador to Spain, while Humbert led the next and equally unsuccessful attempt to invade Ireland, surrendering at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ballinamuck">Battle of Ballinamuck</a> in 1798.

In Britain, the action was lauded at the time and since: <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="George%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Spencer">Lord Spencer</a> described the operation as "an exploit which has not I believe ever before graced our naval annals". Historian James Henderson says of the action: "It was a feat of arms and seamanship such as had never been done before, and never was done again," and <a href="Richard%20Woodman">Richard Woodman</a> calls it "a dazzling display of seamanship by all concerned in the alternating darkness and moonlight of a boisterous night". Five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, with clasps "Indefatigable 13 Jany. 1797" and "Amazon 13 Jany. 1797", awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

The Blind Leading the Blind

The Blind Leading the Blind, Blind, or The Parable of the Blind () is a painting by the <a href="Dutch%20and%20Flemish%20Renaissance%20painting">Netherlandish Renaissance</a> artist <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a>, completed in 1568. Executed in <a href="Glue-size">distemper</a> on linen canvas, it measures . It depicts the Biblical parable of <a href="the%20blind%20leading%20the%20blind">the blind leading the blind</a> from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> 15:14, and is in the collection of the <a href="Museo%20di%20Capodimonte">Museo di Capodimonte</a> in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, Italy.

The painting reflects Bruegel's mastery of observation. Each figure has a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of <a href="globe%20%28human%20eye%29">globe</a> and <a href="Enucleation%20of%20the%20eye">removed eyes</a>. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son <a href="Pieter%20Brueghel%20the%20Younger">Pieter Brueghel the Younger</a>, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a> and <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, and <a href="The%20Parable%20of%20the%20Blind%20%28novel%29">a novel</a> by <a href="Gert%20Hofmann">Gert Hofmann</a>.

Bruegel painted "The Blind" the year before his death. It has a bitter, sorrowful tone, which may be related to the establishment of the <a href="Council%20of%20Troubles">Council of Troubles</a> in 1567 by the government of the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>. The council ordered mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism. The placement of <a href="Sint-Anna%20Church%20%28Itterbeek%29">Sint-Anna Church</a> of the village <a href="Sint-Anna-Pede">Sint-Anna-Pede</a> has led to both pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations, though it is not clear that the painting was meant as a political statement.

The painting depicts a procession of six blind, disfigured men. They pass along a path bordered by a river on one side and a village with a church on the other. The leader of the group has fallen on his back into a ditch and, because they are all linked by their staffs, seems about to drag his companions down with him. A cowherd stands in the background.

Bruegel based the work on the Biblical <a href="parable">parable</a> of <a href="the%20blind%20leading%20the%20blind">the blind leading the blind</a> from <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Matthew</a> 15:14, in which Christ refers to the <a href="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>. According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's audience was likely as familiar with <a href="Classics">classical literature</a> as with the Bible. <a href="Desiderius%20Erasmus">Erasmus</a> had published his "<a href="Adagia">Adagia</a>" two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation """" ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet <a href="Horace">Horace</a>. Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.

The faces and bodies of the blind men, and background detail including the church, are rendered in exceptionally fine detail. The backward-falling posture of the guide demonstrates Bruegel's mastery of <a href="foreshortening">foreshortening</a>. Bruegel's settings tend to be fictional, but that of "The Blind Leading the Blind" has been identified as the village <a href="Sint-Anna-Pede">Sint-Anna-Pede</a>, and the church as <a href="Sint-Anna%20Church%20%28Itterbeek%29">Sint-Anna Church</a>.

One of four surviving Bruegel paintings in <a href="Glue-size">distemper</a>, the work is a <a href="t%C3%BCchlein">tüchlein</a>, a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue. This medium was widely used in painting and <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">manuscript illumination</a> before the advent of oil paint. It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator <a href="Mayken%20Verhulst">Mayken Verhulst</a>; his teacher <a href="Pieter%20Coecke%20van%20Aelst">Pieter Coecke van Aelst</a>; and painter and illuminator <a href="Giulio%20Clovio">Giulio Clovio</a>, with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper. Due to the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue, tüchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore. "The Blind Leading the Blind" is in good condition and has suffered no more than some erosion, such as of a herdsman and some fowl in the middle ground. The grain of the linen canvas is visible beneath the delicate brushstrokes. The work is signed and dated "". The painting measures , the largest of 1568.

The austere tone is achieved through pigments in a colour scheme of mostly greys, greens, brownish-reds, and blacks. The diagonal movement of the bodies creates a dramatic tension in the foreground which is divided diagonally from the landscape background. The flat country features are distinctly Flemish, unlike in most of Bruegel's landscapes, in which he introduced foreign elements such as mountain ranges even into local scenery.

In contrast to earlier depictions of the blind as beneficiaries of divine gifts, Bruegel's men are stumbling and decrepit, and portrayed without sympathy. The eyeless figure would have been interpreted as a man who had suffered punishment for wrongdoing or fighting.

Bruegel painted with the empirical objectivity of the Renaissance. In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts, though there is still some diagnostic disagreement. French anatomical pathologist <a href="Jean-Martin%20Charcot">Jean-Martin Charcot</a> and anatomical artist <a href="Paul%20Richer">Paul Richer</a> published an early account, "" (""The deformed and sick in art"", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957. The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had <a href="Enucleation%20of%20the%20eye">his eyes removed</a>, along with the eyelids: the third suffers from <a href="corneal%20leukoma">corneal leukoma</a>; the fourth atrophy of the <a href="globe%20%28human%20eye%29">globe</a>; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or <a href="Photophobia">photophobic</a>; and the sixth has <a href="pemphigus">pemphigus</a> or <a href="bullous%20pemphigoid">bullous pemphigoid</a>. Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as they would have had to rely on their senses of smell and hearing.

Sixteenth-century Europe was undergoing many societal changes: the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and its <a href="The%20Reformation%20and%20art">rejection of public religious imagery</a>; <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance humanism</a> and its emphasis on <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> at the expense of religious faith; and the growth of the <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> amidst the rise of <a href="mercantilism">mercantilism</a>. It was a time of rapid advances in learning and knowledge, and a move towards the empirical sciences—the age of the <a href="Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> theory of <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Copernicus</a> and of <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>'s printing presses. The <a href="cartography">cartography</a> of <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Ortelius</a> influenced the painting of landscapes, and the advances <a href="Andreas%20Vesalius">Vesalius</a> brought to the study of <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> via the direct observation of dissected bodies, motivated artists to pay greater attention to the accuracy of the anatomy in their works.

Art was now traded in open markets; artists sought to distinguish themselves with subjects different from traditional noble, mythological, and Biblical ones, and developed new, realistic techniques based on empirical observation. Classical literature provided precedents for dealing with "low" subjects in art. <a href="Genre%20art">Genre art</a> and its depiction of ordinary people and everyday life emerged against this background.

<a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> began his career illustrating landscapes and fantastic scenes in a dense style that earned him a reputation as artistic heir to <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>. He soon came to follow the example of another master, <a href="Pieter%20Aertsen">Pieter Aertsen</a>, who had made a name for himself in the 1550s depicting everyday scenes in a highly realistic style, such as the detailed array of meat products that dominate his large "Butcher's Stall" of 1551. Bruegel's subjects became more quotidian and his style observational. He achieved fame for detailed, accurate and realistic portrayals of <a href="peasant">peasant</a>s, with whom his paintings were popular. He painted on linen canvas and oak panel, and avoided scenes of magnificence and portraits of nobility or royalty. The peasants Bruegel at first depicted were featureless and undifferentiated; as his work matured, their physiognomy became markedly more detailed and expressive.

In 1563, Bruegel married Mayken, the daughter of his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and moved to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, the seat of government in the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a> (1556–1714). In 1567 the governor of the Netherlands, the <a href="Fernando%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Alba">Duke of Alba</a>, established the <a href="Council%20of%20Troubles">Council of Troubles</a> (popularly called the "Blood Council") to suppress non-Catholic religions and enforce Spanish rule, leading to mass arrests and executions. Whether Bruegel had Calvinist sympathies or intended a political message in "The Blind" is not clear, but the evidence indicates he likely held views critical of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. A bitter, sorrowful tone characterizes his last works, such as "The Blind" and "<a href="The%20Magpie%20on%20the%20Gallows">The Magpie on the Gallows</a>".

In ancient Greece the blind were depicted as having received gifts from the gods, and blind singers were held in high regard. In mediaeval Europe, the blind were depicted as the subjects of miracles, such as Bartimaeus in the <a href="healing%20the%20blind%20near%20Jericho">healing the blind near Jericho</a> in <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Mark</a> 10:46–52. Following the Reformation, painted depictions of saints and miracles fell out of favour in Protestant areas. In Catholic thought, charitable <a href="works%20of%20mercy">works of mercy</a>, such as giving alms to the blind and poor, were <a href="good%20works">good works</a> which, together with faith, helped the salvation of the doer. However, the Protestant doctrine of "<a href="sola%20fide">sola fide</a>" rejected the efficacy of works in achieving salvation, prescribing that it depended on faith alone (and the complication of God's <a href="predestination">predestined will</a> for each individual). The status of charity for the poor and infirm diminished, and beggars saw their circumstances deteriorate. In popular literature of the time, the blind were depicted as rogues or targets of pranks. The parable of the blind leading the blind also appears as one of the illustrated proverbs in Bruegel's "<a href="Netherlandish%20Proverbs">Netherlandish Proverbs</a>" (1559).

Charles Bouleau wrote of the tension in Bruegel's compositional rhythms. The picture is divided into nine equal parts divided by a set of parallel oblique lines. These are divided by another network of lines at constant angles to the first. The composition invites the reader to follow the action rather than dwell on the individual figures. The blind men resemble each other in dress and facial features, and they appear as if they succeed one another in a single movement culminating in a fall, beginning on the left with "rambling, then hesitation, alarm, stumbling, and finally falling". The succession of heads follows a curve, and the further the succession, the greater the space between heads, suggesting increasing speed. The steep roofs of the background houses contribute to the composition's feeling of motion.

Art historian <a href="Gustav%20Gl%C3%BCck">Gustav Glück</a> noted incongruities in that the beggars are well-dressed and carry staves and full purses. Academics Kenneth C. Lindsay and Bernard Huppé suggest Bruegel may have implied that the blind men represent false priests who ignored Christ's admonitions not to carry gold, purses, or staves; the leader carries a <a href="hurdy-gurdy">hurdy-gurdy</a>, a musical instrument associated with beggars in Bruegel's time; this perhaps implies a false minstrel, one who sings praises not for God.

The church in the background, identified as the Sint-Anna Church at <a href="Dilbeek">Dilbeek</a> in modern <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, has sparked much commentary. One view holds that the church is evidence of the painting's moralistic intent—that while the first two blind men stumble and are beyond redemption, the other four are behind the church and thus may be saved. Another interpretation has it that the church, with a withered tree placed before it, is an anti-Catholic symbol, and that those who follow it will fall following a blind leader as do the men in the ditch. Others deny any symbolism in the church, noting that churches frequently appear in Bruegel's village scenes as they were a common part of the village landscape. Medical researcher <a href="Zeynel%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Karcioglu">Zeynel A. Karcioglu</a> suggests the church represents indifference to the plight of the handicapped.

In contrast to the posed, static figures typical of paintings of the period, Bruegel suggests the trajectory of time and space through the accelerated movement of the figures. Critics Charcot and Richer wrote that the concept of visualizing movement was not formulated until the 17th century, and that Bruegel prefigures motion pictures and <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Duchamp</a>'s "<a href="Nude%20Descending%20a%20Staircase%2C%20No.%202">Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</a>". Karcioglu sees the painting as anticipating the 19th-century <a href="chronophotography">chronophotography</a> of <a href="%C3%89tienne-Jules%20Marey">Étienne-Jules Marey</a>. Dutch film director <a href="Joris%20Ivens">Joris Ivens</a> stated, "If Bruegel were alive today he would be a film director."

"The Blind Leading the Blind" has been considered one of the great masterpieces of painting. Bruegel's is the earliest surviving painting whose subject is the parable of the blind leading the blind, though there are earlier engravings from the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> known that Bruegel was likely aware of, including attributed to Bosch, and by <a href="Cornelis%20Massijs">Cornelis Massijs</a>. Bruegel's paintings have enjoyed worldwide popularity and have been the subjects of scholarly works in disciplines even outside the arts, such as medicine.

Bruegel's depictions of beggars in paintings such as "The Blind Leading the Blind" left a strong influence on those who followed him, such as <a href="David%20Vinckboons">David Vinckboons</a>. <a href="Hieronymus%20Wierix">Hieronymus Wierix</a> incorporated a copy of "The Blind Leading the Blind" into the series "Twelve Flemish Proverbs". A forgery attributed to <a href="Jacob%20Savery">Jacob Savery</a> called "The Blind" appeared bearing a false inscription dating it 1562. Bruegel's son <a href="Pieter%20Brueghel%20the%20Younger">Pieter Brueghel the Younger</a> painted a larger copy in with extra details, including a flock of sheep, that hangs in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>; this copy was in the collection of <a href="Ferdinando%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua</a>, patron of Italian <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> painter <a href="Domenico%20Fetti">Domenico Fetti</a>, who may have been influenced by the painting when he executed his own version of the parable around 1621–22.

The painting has been the subject of poetry, including works by the Germans <a href="Josef%20Weinheber">Josef Weinheber</a> and <a href="Walter%20Bauer%20%28writer%29">Walter Bauer</a>, and Frenchman <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a>'s "The Blind". American <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> wrote a series of poems on Bruegel's paintings; his "Parable of the Blind" focuses on the meaning of "The Blind"s composition—a word that appears three times in the poems eight <a href="tercet">tercet</a>s. The figures stumble diagonally downward, and—

Bruegel's painting served as a model for Belgian playwright <a href="Maurice%20Maeterlinck">Maurice Maeterlinck</a>'s one-act "<a href="The%20Blind">The Blind</a>". <a href="West%20Germany">West German</a> writer <a href="Gert%20Hofmann">Gert Hofmann</a>'s 1985 novel "<a href="The%20Parable%20of%20the%20Blind%20%28novel%29">The Parable of the Blind</a>" features Bruegel and the six blind men: to accomplish a realistic portrayal, Bruegel repeatedly has the men cross a bridge and fall into a creek in midwinter until their expressions achieve the desolation Bruegel believes represents the human condition. A 1987 historical novel "Bruegel, or the Workshop of Dreams" by has Bruegel painting the blind out of fear of losing his own eyesight.

French comics artist <a href="F%27murr">F'murr</a>'s comic strip "Les Aveugles" (1991) was directly inspired by Bruegel's painting "The Blind Leading the Blind". 

"The Blind Leading the Blind" and "The Misanthrope" were discovered in the collection of the Count Giovanni Battista Masi of <a href="Parma">Parma</a> in 1612, when <a href="Ranuccio%20I%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma</a> confiscated Masi's property for his part in a conspiracy against the <a href="House%20of%20Farnese">House of Farnese</a>. How the painting arrived in Italy is uncertain, though it is known that Masi's father Cosimo returned from the Netherlands in 1595 with a number of Netherlandish paintings. The Farnese art collection came to be one of the largest of the Renaissance era, divided amongst the Farnese residences in Parma and Rome.

In the 18th century, <a href="Charles%20III%20of%20Spain">Charles III of Spain</a> inherited the collection from his mother, <a href="Elisabeth%20Farnese">Elisabeth Farnese</a>, heiress of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Parma">Duchy of Parma</a> in north Italy, who became Queen consort of Spain. As a younger son, Charles had been made <a href="Duke%20of%20Parma">Duke of Parma</a>, then boldly seized the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>, becoming <a href="Charles%20III%20of%20Spain">Charles VII of Naples</a>, before inheriting the Spanish throne. Charles housed the collection in what is now the <a href="Museo%20di%20Capodimonte">National Museum of Capodimonte</a> in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. The painting hangs in the Capodimonte with "The Misanthrope", as part of the <a href="Farnese%20collection">Farnese collection</a>.

Archaea

Archaea ( or or ) constitute a <a href="Domain%20%28biology%29">domain</a> of <a href="Unicellular%20organism">single-celled</a> <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are <a href="prokaryotes">prokaryotes</a>, meaning they have no <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>.
Archaea were initially classified as <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is <a href="Carl%20Woese">outdated</a>.

Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, <a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> and <a href="Eukaryote">Eukarya</a>. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized <a href="phylum">phyla</a>. Classification is difficult because most have not been <a href="Isolation%20%28microbiology%29">isolated</a> in the laboratory and were only detected by analysis of their <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s in samples from their environment.

Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have shapes quite unlike that of bacteria, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of "<a href="Haloquadratum%20walsbyi">Haloquadratum walsbyi</a>". Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess <a href="gene">gene</a>s and several <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s involved in <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> and <a href="translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a>. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on <a href="ether%20lipid">ether lipid</a>s in their <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s, including <a href="archaeol">archaeol</a>s. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from <a href="organic%20compounds">organic compounds</a>, such as sugars, to <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="ion">metal ions</a> or even <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen gas</a>. Salt-tolerant archaea (the <a href="Haloarchaea">Haloarchaea</a>) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea <a href="carbon%20fixation">fix carbon</a>, but unlike plants and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea <a href="asexual%20reproduction">reproduce asexually</a> by <a href="binary%20fission">binary fission</a>, <a href="Fragmentation%20%28reproduction%29">fragmentation</a>, or <a href="budding">budding</a>; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms <a href="spore">spore</a>s.

The first observed archaea were <a href="extremophile">living in harsh environments</a> such as <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s and <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>s with no other organisms, but improved detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, including soils, oceans, and <a href="marshland">marshland</a>s. They are also part of the <a href="human%20microbiota">human microbiota</a> in the <a href="Colon%20%28anatomy%29">gut</a>, mouth, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in <a href="plankton">plankton</a> may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a> and the <a href="nitrogen%20cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>. No clear examples of archaeal <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s or <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s are known, but they are often <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualists</a> or <a href="commensalism">commensals</a>. One example is the <a href="methanogen">methane producing strains</a> that inhabit <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">human</a> and <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a> guts, where their vast numbers aid <a href="digestion">digestion</a>. Methanogens are also used in <a href="biogas">biogas</a> production and <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a>, and <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic <a href="solvents">solvents</a>.

For much of the 20th century, prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, <a href="Emile%20Zuckerkandl">Emile Zuckerkandl</a> and <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> proposed instead using the sequences of the <a href="gene">gene</a>s in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> approach is the main method used today.

Archaea – at that time only the <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>s were known – were first classified separately from bacteria in 1977 by <a href="Carl%20Woese">Carl Woese</a> and <a href="George%20E.%20Fox">George E. Fox</a> based on their <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> (rRNA) genes. They called these groups the "Urkingdoms" of Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, though other researchers treated them as <a href="kingdom%20%28biology%29">kingdoms</a> or subkingdoms. Woese and Fox gave the first evidence for Archaebacteria as a separate "line of descent": 1. lack of <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> in their cell walls, 2. two unusual coenzymes, 3. results of <a href="16S%20ribosomal%20RNA">16S ribosomal RNA</a> gene sequencing. To emphasize this difference, Woese, <a href="Otto%20Kandler">Otto Kandler</a> and <a href="Mark%20Wheelis">Mark Wheelis</a> later proposed reclassifying organisms into three natural <a href="Domain%20%28biology%29">domains</a>: the <a href="Eukarya">Eukarya</a>, the <a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> and the Archaea, in what is now known as "The Woesian Revolution".

The word "archaea" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> , meaning "ancient things", as the first representatives of the domain Archaea were <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>s and it was assumed that their metabolism reflected Earth's primitive atmosphere and the organisms' antiquity, but as new habitats were studied, more organisms were discovered. Extreme <a href="halophilic">halophilic</a> and <a href="hyperthermophilic">hyperthermophilic</a> microbes were also included in Archaea. For a long time, archaea were seen as extremophiles that only exist in extreme habitats such as <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s and <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>s, but by the end of the 20th century, archaea had been identified in non-extreme environments as well. Today, they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms abundantly distributed throughout nature. This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples (such as water or soil) by multiplying their ribosomal genes. This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not been <a href="microbiological%20culture">cultured</a> in the laboratory.

The classification of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious field. Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications rely heavily on the use of the sequence of <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> genes to reveal relationships between organisms (<a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogenetics</a>). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main <a href="phylum">phyla</a>, the <a href="Euryarchaeota">Euryarchaeota</a> and <a href="Crenarchaeota">Crenarchaeota</a>. Other groups have been tentatively created. For example, the peculiar species "<a href="Nanoarchaeum%20equitans">Nanoarchaeum equitans</a>", which was discovered in 2003, has been given its own phylum, the <a href="Nanoarchaeota">Nanoarchaeota</a>. A new phylum <a href="Korarchaeota">Korarchaeota</a> has also been proposed. It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla, but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota. Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the <a href="Archaeal%20Richmond%20Mine%20acidophilic%20nanoorganisms">Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms</a> (ARMAN, comprising <a href="Micrarchaeota">Micrarchaeota</a> and <a href="Parvarchaeota">Parvarchaeota</a>), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known.

A superphylum – TACK – has been proposed that includes the <a href="Thaumarchaeota">Thaumarchaeota</a>, <a href="Aigarchaeota">Aigarchaeota</a>, <a href="Crenarchaeota">Crenarchaeota</a>, and <a href="Korarchaeota">Korarchaeota</a>. This superphylum may be related to the origin of eukaryotes. More recently, the superphylum <a href="Asgard%20%28archaea%29">Asgard</a> has been named and proposed to be more closely related to the original eukaryote and a sister group to TACK.

The classification of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a <a href="species">species</a> as a group of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other <a href="reproductive%20isolation">but not with others</a>) is of no help since archaea reproduce asexually.

Archaea show high levels of <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a> between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus "<a href="Ferroplasma">Ferroplasma</a>". On the other hand, studies in "<a href="Halorubrum">Halorubrum</a>" found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. Some researchers question whether such species designations have practical meaning.

Current knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure. The Bacteria also include many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.

On average, archaeal genomes show higher levels of complexity than those of bacteria.

The <a href="age%20of%20the%20Earth">age of the Earth</a> is about 4.54 billion years. Scientific evidence suggests that <a href="Abiogenesis">life began</a> on Earth at least 3.5 <a href="billion%20years%20ago">billion years ago</a>. The earliest evidence for <a href="life">life on Earth</a> is <a href="graphite">graphite</a> found to be <a href="Biogenic%20substance">biogenic</a> in 3.7 billion-year-old <a href="Metasediment">metasedimentary rocks</a> discovered in <a href="Western%20Greenland">Western Greenland</a> and <a href="microbial%20mat">microbial mat</a> <a href="fossils">fossils</a> found in 3.48 billion-year-old <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> discovered in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. In 2015, possible remains of <a href="Biotic%20material">biotic matter</a> were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.

Although probable prokaryotic cell <a href="fossils">fossils</a> date to almost 3.5 <a href="bya">billion years ago</a>, most prokaryotes do not have distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot be used to identify them as archaea. Instead, <a href="chemical%20fossil">chemical fossil</a>s of unique <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in <a href="shale">shale</a>s dating from 2.7 billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. The oldest such traces come from the <a href="Isua%20greenstone%20belt">Isua district</a>, which includes Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8 billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth.

Woese argued that the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes represent separate lines of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral colony of organisms. One possibility is that this occurred before the <a href="evolution%20of%20cells">evolution of cells</a>, when the lack of a typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted <a href="lateral%20gene%20transfer">lateral gene transfer</a>, and that the common ancestors of the three domains arose by fixation of specific subsets of genes. It is possible that the last common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was a <a href="thermophile">thermophile</a>, which raises the possibility that lower temperatures are "extreme environments" for archaea, and organisms that live in cooler environments appeared only later. Since archaea and bacteria are no more related to each other than they are to eukaryotes, the term "prokaryote" suggests a false similarity between them.

The following table compares some major characteristics of the three domains, to illustrate their similarities and differences.

Archaea were split off as a third domain because of the large differences in their ribosomal RNA structure. The particular molecule <a href="16S%20rRNA">16S rRNA</a> is key to the production of proteins in all organisms. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations in their 16S rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great (but not absolute) stability in the structure of this nucleotide over generations. 16S rRNA is large enough to show organism-specific variations, but still small enough to be sequenced quickly. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequencing of organisms, developed a new sequencing method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared to other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the patterns between species, the more closely they are related.

Woese used his new rRNA comparison method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He sequenced a variety of species and happened upon a group of methanogens with rRNA vastly different from any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much more similar to each other than to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the archaea were genetically more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor.

One property unique to archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in bacteria and eukarya, which may be a contributing factor to the ability of many archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and <a href="salinity">salinity</a>. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular <a href="conserved%20signature%20indels">conserved signature indels</a> and signature proteins uniquely present in either all archaea or different main groups within archaea. Another unique feature of archaea, found in no other organisms, is <a href="methanogenesis">methanogenesis</a> (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. <a href="Methanogen">Methanogen</a>s also play a critical role in the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.

The relationship between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are the object of the majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of <a href="gram-positive">gram-positive</a> bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved <a href="indels">indels</a> in a number of important proteins, such as <a href="Hsp70">Hsp70</a> and <a href="glutamine%20synthetase">glutamine synthetase</a> I;, but the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).

It has been proposed that the archaea evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic <a href="evolutionary%20pressure">selection pressure</a>. This is suggested by the observation that archaea are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day Archaea. The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; <a href="Thomas%20Cavalier-Smith">Cavalier-Smith</a> has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.

The evolutionary relationship between archaea and <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s remains unclear. Aside from the similarities in cell structure and function that are discussed below, many genetic trees group the two.

Complicating factors include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum <a href="Crenarchaeota">Crenarchaeota</a> is closer than the relationship between the <a href="Euryarchaeota">Euryarchaeota</a> and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as "<a href="Thermotogae">Thermotoga maritima</a>", from <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the <a href="eocyte%20hypothesis">eocyte hypothesis</a>, posits that <a href="Eukaryota">Eukaryota</a> emerged relatively late from the Archaea.

A lineage of archaea discovered in 2015, "<a href="Lokiarchaeum">Lokiarchaeum</a>" (of proposed new Phylum "<a href="Lokiarchaeota">Lokiarchaeota</a>"), named for a <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a> called <a href="Loki%27s%20Castle">Loki's Castle</a> in the Arctic Ocean, was found to be the most closely related to eukaryotes known at that time. It has been called a transitional organism between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Several sister phyla of "Lokiarchaeota" have since been found ("<a href="Thorarchaeota">Thorarchaeota</a>", "<a href="Odinarchaeota">Odinarchaeota</a>", "<a href="Heimdallarchaeota">Heimdallarchaeota</a>"), all together comprising a newly proposed supergroup <a href="Asgard%20%28archaea%29">Asgard</a>, which may appear as a sister taxon to TACK. Details of the relation of Asgard members and eukaryotes are still under consideration.

Individual archaea range from 0.1 <a href="Micrometre">micrometers</a> (μm) to over 15 μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, commonly as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the <a href="Crenarchaeota">Crenarchaeota</a> include irregularly shaped lobed cells in "<a href="Sulfolobus">Sulfolobus</a>", needle-like filaments that are less than half a micrometer in diameter in "<a href="Thermofilum">Thermofilum</a>", and almost perfectly rectangular rods in "<a href="Thermoproteus">Thermoproteus</a>" and "<a href="Pyrobaculum">Pyrobaculum</a>". Archaea in the genus "<a href="Haloquadratum">Haloquadratum</a>" such as "<a href="Haloquadratum%20walsbyi">Haloquadratum walsbyi</a>" are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a <a href="prokaryotic%20cytoskeleton">prokaryotic cytoskeleton</a>. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In "<a href="Thermoplasma">Thermoplasma</a>" and "<a href="Ferroplasma">Ferroplasma</a>" the lack of a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble <a href="Amoeboid">amoebae</a>.

Some species form aggregates or filaments of cells up to 200 μm long. These organisms can be prominent in <a href="biofilm">biofilm</a>s. Notably, aggregates of "<a href="Thermococcus">Thermococcus</a> coalescens" cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells. Archaea in the genus "<a href="Pyrodictium">Pyrodictium</a>" produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long, thin hollow tubes called "cannulae" that stick out from the cells' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush-like agglomeration. The function of these cannulae is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors. Multi-species colonies exist, such as the "string-of-pearls" community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp. Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to long; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species.

Archaea and bacteria have generally similar <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s. Like bacteria, the <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s of archaea are usually bounded by a <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> and they swim using one or more <a href="flagella">flagella</a>. Structurally, archaea are most similar to <a href="gram-positive%20bacteria">gram-positive bacteria</a>. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a <a href="periplasmic%20space">periplasmic space</a>; the exception to this general rule is "<a href="Ignicoccus">Ignicoccus</a>", which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound <a href="vesicle%20%28biology%29">vesicles</a> and is enclosed by an outer membrane.

Most archaea (but not "<a href="Thermoplasma">Thermoplasma</a>" and "<a href="Ferroplasma">Ferroplasma</a>") possess a cell wall. In most archaea the wall is assembled from surface-layer proteins, which form an <a href="S-layer">S-layer</a>. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover the outside of the cell (like <a href="chain%20mail">chain mail</a>). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> in their cell walls. <a href="Methanobacteriales">Methanobacteriales</a> do have cell walls containing <a href="pseudopeptidoglycan">pseudopeptidoglycan</a>, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks <a href="D-amino%20acids">D-amino acids</a> and <a href="N-acetylmuramic%20acid">N-acetylmuramic acid</a>.

Archaea flagella are known as <a href="archaellum">archaella</a>, that operate like bacterial <a href="flagellum">flagella</a> – their long stalks are driven by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">proton gradient</a> across the membrane, but archaealla are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the <a href="type%20III%20secretion%20system">type III secretion system</a>, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV <a href="Pilus">pili</a>. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore to the tip of the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.

Archaeal membranes are made of molecules that are distinctly different from those in all other life forms, showing that archaea are related only distantly to bacteria and eukaryotes. In all organisms, <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s are made of molecules known as <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s. These molecules possess both a <a href="chemical%20polarity">polar</a> part that dissolves in water (the <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> "head"), and a "greasy" non-polar part that does not (the lipid tail). These dissimilar parts are connected by a <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a> moiety. In water, phospholipids cluster, with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from it. The major structure in cell membranes is a double layer of these phospholipids, which is called a <a href="lipid%20bilayer">lipid bilayer</a>.

The phospholipids of archaea are unusual in four ways:

Archaea exhibit a great variety of chemical reactions in their <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into <a href="primary%20nutritional%20groups">nutritional groups</a>, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s such as <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (they are <a href="chemotroph">chemotroph</a>s). These include <a href="nitrifying%20bacteria">nitrifiers</a>, <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>s and <a href="anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic</a> <a href="methane">methane</a> <a href="oxidiser">oxidiser</a>s. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a <a href="redox">redox</a> reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an <a href="electron%20donor">electron donor</a> and one as an <a href="electron%20acceptor">electron acceptor</a>. The energy released is used to generate <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP) through <a href="chemiosmosis">chemiosmosis</a>, the same basic process that happens in the <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondrion</a> of eukaryotic cells.

Other groups of archaea use sunlight as a source of energy (they are <a href="phototroph">phototroph</a>s), but oxygen–generating <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> (the <a href="Entner%E2%80%93Doudoroff%20pathway">Entner–Doudoroff pathway</a>) and either a complete or partial <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.

Some Euryarchaeota are <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>s (archaea that produce methane as a result of metabolism) living in <a href="anaerobic%20environment">anaerobic environment</a>s, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as an electron acceptor to oxidize <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Methanogenesis involves a range of <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a>s that are unique to these archaea, such as <a href="coenzyme%20M">coenzyme M</a> and <a href="methanofuran">methanofuran</a>. Other organic compounds such as <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s, <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> or <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> are used as alternative <a href="electron%20acceptor">electron acceptor</a>s by methanogens. These reactions are common in <a href="Gut%20%28zoology%29">gut</a>-dwelling archaea. <a href="Acetic%20acid">Acetic acid</a> is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by "acetotrophic" archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order <a href="Methanosarcinales">Methanosarcinales</a>, and are a major part of the communities of microorganisms that produce <a href="biogas">biogas</a>.
Other archaea use in the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> as a source of carbon, in a process called <a href="carbon%20fixation">carbon fixation</a> (they are <a href="autotroph">autotroph</a>s). This process involves either a highly modified form of the <a href="Calvin%20cycle">Calvin cycle</a> or another metabolic pathway called the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. The Crenarchaeota also use the <a href="reverse%20Krebs%20cycle">reverse Krebs cycle</a> while the Euryarchaeota also use the <a href="reductive%20acetyl-CoA%20pathway">reductive acetyl-CoA pathway</a>. Carbon–fixation is powered by inorganic energy sources. No known archaea carry out <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Archaeal energy sources are extremely diverse, and range from the oxidation of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> by the <a href="Nitrosopumilales">Nitrosopumilales</a> to the oxidation of <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> or elemental <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> by species of "<a href="Sulfolobus">Sulfolobus</a>", using either oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors.

<a href="Phototroph">Phototroph</a>ic archaea use light to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP. In the <a href="Halobacteria">Halobacteria</a>, light-activated ion pumps like <a href="bacteriorhodopsin">bacteriorhodopsin</a> and <a href="halorhodopsin">halorhodopsin</a> generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of and into the cell across the <a href="plasma%20membrane">plasma membrane</a>. The energy stored in these <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a>s is then converted into ATP by <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a>. This process is a form of <a href="photophosphorylation">photophosphorylation</a>. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a <a href="retinol">retinol</a> <a href="Cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactor</a> buried in the center of the protein.

Archaea usually have a single <a href="circular%20prokaryote%20chromosome">circular chromosome</a>, with as many as 5,751,492 <a href="base%20pair">base pair</a>s in "<a href="Methanosarcina%20acetivorans">Methanosarcina acetivorans</a>", the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885 base-pair genome of "<a href="Nanoarchaeum%20equitans">Nanoarchaeum equitans</a>" is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called "<a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>s", are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to <a href="bacterial%20conjugation">bacterial conjugation</a>.

Archaea can be infected by double-stranded <a href="DNA%20viruses">DNA viruses</a> that are unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the "<a href="Halorubrum%20pleomorphic%20virus%201">Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1</a>" ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95 °C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a> from <a href="repetitive%20DNA">repetitive DNA</a> sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.

Archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes, with up to 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of the remainder of the unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a>, <a href="Translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a>, and <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide metabolism</a>. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function – such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a> into novel <a href="operon">operon</a>s, and large differences in <a href="tRNA">tRNA</a> genes and their <a href="aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a>s.

Transcription in archaea more closely resembles eukaryotic than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a> being very close to its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems to be close to that of the eukaryotic <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20II">RNA polymerase II</a>, with similar protein assemblies (the <a href="general%20transcription%20factor">general transcription factor</a>s) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's <a href="promoter%20%28biology%29">promoter</a>, but other archaeal <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s are closer to those found in bacteria. <a href="Post-transcriptional%20modification">Post-transcriptional modification</a> is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack <a href="intron">intron</a>s, although there are many introns in their <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> and <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.

"Halobacterium volcanii", an extreme halophilic archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.

When the hyperthermophilic archaea "<a href="Sulfolobus%20solfataricus">Sulfolobus solfataricus</a>" and "Sulfolobus acidocaldarius" are exposed to DNA-damaging UV irradiation or to the agents <a href="bleomycin">bleomycin</a> or <a href="mitomycin%20C">mitomycin C</a>, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in "S. solfataricus" could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in "S. acidocaldarius". Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between "Sulfolobus" cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a>. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species-specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.

Archaea reproduce asexually by binary or multiple <a href="fission%20%28biology%29">fission</a>, fragmentation, or <a href="budding">budding</a>; <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> and <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> do not occur, so if a species of archaea exists in more than one form, all have the same genetic material. <a href="Cell%20division">Cell division</a> is controlled in a <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>; after the cell's <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus "<a href="Sulfolobus">Sulfolobus</a>", the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (<a href="origin%20of%20replication">origins of replication</a>) using <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>s that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.

In euryarchaea the cell division protein <a href="FtsZ">FtsZ</a>, which forms a contracting ring around the cell, and the components of the <a href="septum">septum</a> that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, but the cell division machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.

Both bacteria and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make <a href="spore">spore</a>s. Some species of <a href="Haloarchaea">Haloarchaea</a> undergo <a href="phenotypic%20switching">phenotypic switching</a> and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that are resistant to <a href="osmotic%20shock">osmotic shock</a> and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, but these are not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.

Archaea exist in a broad range of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, and as a major part of global <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s, may represent about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a>s. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in <a href="geyser">geyser</a>s, <a href="black%20smoker">black smoker</a>s, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly <a href="salt">saline</a>, <a href="acid">acid</a>ic, or <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> water, but archaea include <a href="mesophile">mesophile</a>s that grow in mild conditions, in <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s and <a href="marsh">marsh</a>land, <a href="sewage">sewage</a>, the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s, the <a href="intestinal%20tract">intestinal tract</a> of animals, and <a href="soil">soil</a>s.

Extremophile archaea are members of four main <a href="physiological">physiological</a> groups. These are the <a href="halophile">halophile</a>s, <a href="thermophile">thermophile</a>s, <a href="alkaliphile">alkaliphile</a>s, and <a href="Acidophile%20%28organisms%29">acidophiles</a>. These groups are not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.

Halophiles, including the genus "<a href="Halobacterium">Halobacterium</a>", live in extremely saline environments such as <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>s and outnumber their bacterial counterparts at salinities greater than 20–25%. Thermophiles grow best at temperatures above , in places such as hot springs; "hyperthermophilic" archaea grow optimally at temperatures greater than . The archaeal "<a href="Methanopyrus%20kandleri">Methanopyrus kandleri</a>" Strain 116 can even reproduce at , the highest recorded temperature of any organism.

Other archaea exist in very acidic or alkaline conditions. For example, one of the most extreme archaean acidophiles is "<a href="Picrophilus">Picrophilus torridus</a>", which grows at pH 0, which is equivalent to thriving in 1.2 <a href="Molar%20concentration">molar</a> <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>.

This resistance to extreme environments has made archaea the focus of speculation about the possible properties of <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a>. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to those on <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, leading to the suggestion that viable microbes could be transferred between planets in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s.

Recently, several studies have shown that archaea exist not only in mesophilic and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the <a href="plankton">plankton</a> community (as part of the <a href="picoplankton">picoplankton</a>). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in <a href="pure%20culture">pure culture</a>. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global <a href="biogeochemistry">biogeochemical</a> cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of <a href="nitrification">nitrification</a>, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic <a href="nitrogen%20cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s that cover the <a href="sea%20floor">sea floor</a>, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.

Archaea recycle elements such as <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> through their various habitats. Although these activities are vital for normal <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> function, archaea can also contribute to human-made changes, and even cause <a href="pollution">pollution</a>.

Archaea carry out many steps in the <a href="nitrogen%20cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>. This includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems (such as <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>-based respiration and <a href="denitrification">denitrification</a>) as well as processes that introduce nitrogen (such as nitrate assimilation and <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>).
Researchers recently discovered archaeal involvement in <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> oxidation reactions. These reactions are particularly important in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce <a href="nitrite">nitrite</a>, which other microbes then oxidize to <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.

In the <a href="sulfur%20cycle">sulfur cycle</a>, archaea that grow by oxidizing <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms, but the archaea that do this, such as "Sulfolobus", produce <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> as a waste product, and the growth of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to <a href="acid%20mine%20drainage">acid mine drainage</a> and other environmental damage.

In the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>, methanogen archaea remove hydrogen and play an important role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as <a href="decomposer">decomposer</a>s in anaerobic ecosystems, such as sediments, marshes and <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage-treatment</a> works.

The well-characterized interactions between archaea and other organisms are either <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutual</a> or <a href="commensalism">commensal</a>. There are no clear examples of known archaeal <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s or <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s, but some species of methanogens have been suggested to be involved in <a href="periodontal%20disease">infections in the mouth</a>, and "<a href="Nanoarchaeum%20equitans">Nanoarchaeum equitans</a>" may be a parasite of another species of archaea, since it only survives and reproduces within the cells of the Crenarchaeon "<a href="Ignicoccus">Ignicoccus hospitalis</a>", and appears to offer no benefit to its <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a>. Connections between archaeal cells can also be found between the <a href="Archaeal%20Richmond%20Mine%20Acidophilic%20Nanoorganisms">Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms</a> (ARMAN) and another species of archaea called <a href="Thermoplasmatales">Thermoplasmatales</a>, within acid mine drainage biofilms. Although the nature of this relationship is unknown, it is distinct from that of "Nanarchaeaum–Ignicoccus" in that the ultrasmall ARMAN cells are usually independent of the <a href="Thermoplasmatales">Thermoplasmatales</a> cells.

One well-understood example of <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> is the interaction between <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> and <a href="methanogen">methanogenic archaea</a> in the digestive tracts of animals that digest <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, such as <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s and <a href="termite">termite</a>s. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.

In anaerobic protozoa, such as "Plagiopyla frontata", archaea reside inside the protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their <a href="hydrogenosome">hydrogenosome</a>s. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean "<a href="Cenarchaeum">Cenarchaeum symbiosum</a>" lives within (is an <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiont</a> of) the <a href="sponge">sponge</a> "<a href="Axinella">Axinella mexicana</a>".

Archaea can also be commensals, benefiting from an association without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen "<a href="Methanobrevibacter%20smithii">Methanobrevibacter smithii</a>" is by far the most common archaean in the <a href="human%20flora">human flora</a>, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of <a href="coral">coral</a>s, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the <a href="Rhizosphere%20%28ecology%29">rhizosphere</a>).

<a href="Extremophile">Extremophile</a> archaea, particularly those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity, are a source of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that function under these harsh conditions. These enzymes have found many uses. For example, thermostable <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>s, such as the <a href="Pfu%20DNA%20polymerase">Pfu DNA polymerase</a> from "<a href="Pyrococcus%20furiosus">Pyrococcus furiosus</a>", revolutionized <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a> by allowing the <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for <a href="cloning">cloning</a> DNA. In industry, <a href="amylase">amylase</a>s, <a href="galactosidases">galactosidases</a> and <a href="pullulanase">pullulanase</a>s in other species of "<a href="Pyrococcus">Pyrococcus</a>" that function at over allow <a href="food%20processing">food processing</a> at high temperatures, such as the production of low <a href="lactose">lactose</a> milk and <a href="whey">whey</a>. Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in <a href="green%20chemistry">green chemistry</a> that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes them easier to use in <a href="structural%20biology">structural biology</a>. Consequently, the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies.

In contrast to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, the use of the organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a>, since they are part of the community of microorganisms that carry out <a href="anaerobic%20digestion">anaerobic digestion</a> and produce <a href="biogas">biogas</a>. In <a href="mineral%20processing">mineral processing</a>, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from <a href="ore">ore</a>s, including <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> and <a href="copper">copper</a>.

Archaea host a new class of potentially useful <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. A few of these <a href="archaeocin">archaeocin</a>s have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within "<a href="Haloarchaea">Haloarchaea</a>" and "<a href="Sulfolobus">Sulfolobus</a>". These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new <a href="selectable%20marker">selectable marker</a>s for use in archaeal molecular biology.

The Way I See It

The Way I See It is the third <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> singer, songwriter, and producer <a href="Raphael%20Saadiq">Raphael Saadiq</a>. It was released on September 16, 2008, by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>.

After independently releasing the 2004 album "<a href="Ray%20Ray">Ray Ray</a>", Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects and developed a partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> and recorded "The Way I See It" primarily at his <a href="North%20Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">North Hollywood</a> studio with the engineer.

Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their previous experience in recording production while making "The Way I See It". Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques in an attempt to recreate the <a href="Motown">Motown</a> music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album that draws on the <a href="Motown%23Motown%20Sound">Motown Sound</a> and <a href="Philadelphia%20soul">Philadelphia soul</a> styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.

"The Way I See It" was initially overlooked by consumers, but <a href="record%20chart">charted</a> steadily on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and eventually sold 282,000 copies in the United States by 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics and was seen as an exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.

After releasing his second studio album "<a href="Ray%20Ray">Ray Ray</a>" in 2004, Saadiq continued working as a producer, composer, and instrumentalist on other recording artists' music. He was introduced to audio engineer Charles Brungardt through production and songwriting team <a href="Jake%20and%20the%20Phatman">Jake and the Phatman</a>, who had worked on "Ray Ray". Brungardt interned at Blakeslee Recording Company, Saadiq's <a href="North%20Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">North Hollywood</a> recording studio, and eventually became his principal sonic partner on projects. The two shared a fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. They also studied the 2006 book "<a href="Recording%20The%20Beatles">Recording The Beatles</a>" together and had an interest in the knowledge of recording gear by engineers and technicians for English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>. Brungardt increased his <a href="audio%20engineering">engineering</a> output, and in 2007, Saadiq enlisted him to engineer and <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mix</a> English singer <a href="Joss%20Stone">Joss Stone</a>'s studio album "<a href="Introducing%20Joss%20Stone">Introducing Joss Stone</a>", which Saadiq produced.

While vacationing in <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> and <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> in 2008, Saadiq observed people there listening to classic <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> and was inspired to pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for "<a href="Blues%20%26amp%3B%20Soul">Blues & Soul</a>", saying that "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though you can hear it in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route." As a part of <a href="Tony%21%20Toni%21%20Ton%C3%A9%21">Tony! Toni! Toné!</a> during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of <a href="Motown">Motown</a> in his songwriting for the group. Before recording "The Way I See It", Saadiq signed to <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Label executive <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively."

After returning from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording "The Way I See It", which took four months. In an interview for "<a href="Sound%20on%20Sound">Sound on Sound</a>", he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able to live with it day after day, and I think that had a lot to do with how the album turned out." He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to "the state of the industry" and idealized "bounc[ing] ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at <a href="Stax%20Records">Stax</a> and Motown".

Saadiq recorded mostly at Blakeslee Recording Company; Additional sessions took place at Harmonie Park Studios in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and The Music Shed Studios in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. While recording, he immersed himself in a composite character of classic soul singers from videos he watched, including <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a>, <a href="Gladys%20Knight%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Pips">Gladys Knight & the Pips</a>, the <a href="Four%20Tops">Four Tops</a>, and <a href="the%20Temptations">the Temptations</a>. He recorded his vocals with only Brungardt present in the studio, a preference he felt prevented him from "looking for answers from somebody who may not really know". Saadiq said he tended to "record complete takes, and if something isn't quite right but it's got a feel that I know I can never ever capture again, I'll leave it, even if it's <a href="flat%20%28music%29">flat</a>. I mean, there are flat parts on my record, because it's not about perfection, it's about the soul." He recorded background vocals for all songs. Saadiq played most of the instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, sitar, and bass guitar, his instrument of choice throughout his career. He viewed the bass playing of <a href="James%20Jamerson">James Jamerson</a> as an integral part of Motown recordings, citing it as the inspiration for his own bass sound on the album.

Saadiq worked with other musicians, including Joss Stone, percussionist <a href="Jack%20Ashford">Jack Ashford</a>, <a href="string%20section">string</a> arranger <a href="Paul%20Riser">Paul Riser</a>, multi-instrumentalist Bobby Ozuna, singer CJ Hilton, and recording artist <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>. Ashford and Riser were members of <a href="The%20Funk%20Brothers">The Funk Brothers</a>, a group of session musicians for Motown Records during the 1960s. Ashford played tambourine, vibraphone, bells, and shakers on songs such as "<a href="100%20Yard%20Dash%20%28song%29">100 Yard Dash</a>", "<a href="Love%20That%20Girl">Love That Girl</a>", and "Staying in Love". Ozuna, one-half of Jake and the Phatman, co-produced and co-wrote three songs and played several instruments, including bongos, tambourine, and drums. Hilton co-wrote "Never Give You Up" and played its drum and keyboard parts. Wonder's contribution of a harmonica solo on the song was impromptu, as Saadiq reached out to Wonder after recording the song's vocal parts with the improvised line, "I'd like to invite Mr. Stevie Wonder to my album. Come on, Stevie!" After having the idea recommended to him by rapper <a href="Q-Tip%20%28musician%29">Q-Tip</a>, Saadiq also reached out to <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> to record a featured rap for a <a href="remix">remix</a> of "Oh Girl"; it was included on the album as a <a href="bonus%20track">bonus track</a>.

"The Way I See It" was engineered by Saadiq, <a href="Gerry%20Brown">Gerry Brown</a>, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to <a href="Multitrack%20recording">layer</a> multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated techniques such as <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a> and drum <a href="programming%20%28music%29">programming</a>. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied <a href="Mark%20Lewisohn">Mark Lewisohn</a>'s 1988 book "<a href="The%20Complete%20Beatles%20Recording%20Sessions">The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</a>", books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and <a href="microphone%20practice">microphone placement</a>. They also studied Motown <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">EQ</a>s to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq said that he had to disregard "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road</a>. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." Brungardt said in an interview for "<a href="Mix%20%28magazine%29">Mix</a>" that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where "they wanted it clean with no distortion. I was taught to make sure it was polish, polish, polish, and to make sure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are clean for the big <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> vocal."

Saadiq's studio integrated modern equipment such as a <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> <a href="digital%20audio%20workstation">digital workstation</a> and an <a href="Solid%20State%20Logic">SSL 9000</a> mixing console, and featured various vintage gear, including Saadiq's 1960s <a href="Ludwig-Musser">Ludwig</a> <a href="drum%20kit">drum kit</a> and a <a href="Drum%20kit%23Microphones">kick-drum mic</a> purchased from Abbey Road Studios. In the studio, Saadiq and Brungardt experimented with techniques and equipment. They wanted the songs to have slower <a href="wikt%3Aattack%23Noun">attacks</a> like older recordings, as producers in the past did not have advanced <a href="dynamic%20range%20compression">compressors</a>, audio tools that manipulate the <a href="dynamic%20range">dynamic content</a> of <a href="audio%20signal">signals</a> and affect certain sounds in a recording's mix. Their production applied <a href="valve%20audio%20amplifier">tube preamps</a> and <a href="vacuum%20tube">tube</a> compressors, with the former used as a <a href="front%20and%20back%20ends">front end</a> for Pro Tools. For Saadiq's vocals, he used a <a href="Shure%20SM57">Shure SM57</a> <a href="dynamic%20microphone">dynamic microphone</a> to thicken and distort his voice and embellish his characteristically clean delivery, while Brungardt employed a compressor and a Pro Tools <a href="plug-in%20%28computing%29">plug-in</a> during the mix. Saadiq sought a certain "edge" for his vocals and an unpolished sonic element for the album. They also tried to record tracks onto cassette tapes in order to produce a grittier, older sound. Brungardt used a FilterBank plug-in when mixing the album to uncompress vocals and roll off <a href="High-end%20audio">high-end</a> sound from tracks.

Although they wanted to reproduce an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the <a href="outboard%20gear">outboard gear</a>, using a <a href="U%2047">Neumann U 47</a> for guitars, alternating <a href="overhead%20microphone">overhead microphone</a>s for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and <a href="condenser%20microphone">condenser</a> mics for the kit's <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>, and <a href="Ampex">Ampex</a> <a href="tape%20recorder">tape machine</a>s for extra <a href="Comparison%20of%20analog%20and%20digital%20recording%23Analog%20warmth">warmth</a> to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a> to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from "The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions", and as Brungardt recounted, "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different <a href="reverberation">reverbs</a> to get a sound." For Saadiq's bass, they used a <a href="DI%20unit">DI unit</a> to connect a microphone <a href="preamplifier">preamplifier</a>, increased the <a href="Gain%20%28electronics%29">gain</a> on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.

"The Way I See It" has a traditional soul style fashioned after the 1960s <a href="Motown%23Motown%20Sound">Motown Sound</a> and <a href="Philadelphia%20soul">Philadelphia soul</a>. It is a departure from Saadiq's previous work with <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a>, which bears a <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Observer">The New York Observer</a>" said that Saadiq expands further beyond his work as a producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>'s Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-<a href="Barack%20Obama">Obama</a> expression of hope in record form." Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction as a response to the state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: "You force so many terrible things on people, they get tired of it. We have a black president now."

The album's songs draw on Motown's <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>s, driving rhythms, tight drumming, tambourines in the rhythm section, guitar melodies, layered vocal arrangements, and two- to four-minute durations. They also feature bright melodies, <a href="Swing%20%28jazz%20performance%20style%29">swinging</a> bass, sweeping strings, and snare drums that emit reverb. Cameron Carrus of "<a href="The%20Lawrentian">The Lawrentian</a>" said that the most hook-oriented riffs are played on the bass and guitar, which blend "the low with the high", and cited "Keep Marchin", "Love That Girl", and "Staying in Love" as examples. <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" viewed that Saadiq follows the example of 1960s Motown artists such as <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>, Stevie Wonder, and <a href="Holland%E2%80%93Dozier%E2%80%93Holland">Holland–Dozier–Holland</a>, the label's songwriting and production team. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> wrote that the album shares Holland–Dozier–Holland's "bright, swift, clearly <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooked</a> aesthetic". Saadiq sings in a <a href="tenor">tenor</a> voice, which is slightly distorted as a result of the album's post-production.

Saadiq's songwriting is characterized by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and <a href="protest%20song">message songs</a>. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" of the song titles, but "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." Patrick Varine of the "<a href="Observer-Dispatch">Observer-Dispatch</a>" asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R&B lyrics: "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>": "You have to watch out for those curves. <a href="wikt%3Atrend%23Noun">Trendy</a> music comes out, and how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly."
The opening track, "Sure Hope You Mean It", features slightly off-beat percussion, tambourine shakes, and lyrics about a man who awaits a sign of approval from the woman he admires. "Keep Marchin", which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments, was composed in the vein of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> era soul music by artists such as <a href="Sam%20Cooke">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="the%20Staple%20Singers">the Staple Singers</a>. Gail Mitchell from "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" compared the song to <a href="Curtis%20Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a> and <a href="the%20Impressions">the Impressions</a>' 1968 song "<a href="We%27re%20a%20Winner">We're a Winner</a>". Saadiq said "Keep Marchin" was also inspired by his journey in the music industry. "Big Easy", featuring <a href="music%20of%20New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>-style <a href="Brass%20instrument">brass</a> playing, was sung from the point of view of a man in New Orleans who reacts to <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and looks for his lost lover. J. Gabriel Boylan of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Observer">The New York Observer</a>" remarked that the song "manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance, tearing lovers apart." Its composition—mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics—is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland–Dozier–Holland. Saadiq was inspired to write "Big Easy" after watching the 2006 documentary film "<a href="When%20the%20Levees%20Broke">When the Levees Broke</a>". He explained its upbeat composition in an interview for "<a href="All%20Things%20Considered">All Things Considered</a>": "In New Orleans, when they mourn, they really celebrate and have a great time. I wanted to give it that same spirit."
According to Saadiq, "Just One Kiss" can be interpreted as a song devoted to a female love interest, "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29%23Gradual%20changes">crescendo</a>. The ballad "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R&B roots and <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> music, and incorporates <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin</a> style guitar, and <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a> lyrics. "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, "Let's Take a Walk" has sexually forward lyrics and <a href="wikt%3Acome%20on%23Noun">come-ons</a>, which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo "Never Give You Up" is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in <a href="Oakland">Oakland</a>, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line "now I know what they meant by '<a href="Keep%20Your%20Head%20to%20the%20Sky">keep your head to the sky</a>'" makes reference to <a href="Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire">Earth, Wind & Fire</a>, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way."

Saadiq titled "The Way I See It" as a declaration to listeners about how his perspective was more informed by classic soul than before in his career. "This is what I really love", he later explained. "And everything you've heard from me before has been based on the roots of this music." 

The cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, in which Saadiq performed Marvin Gaye's 1965 song "<a href="Ain%27t%20That%20Peculiar">Ain't That Peculiar</a>". It showed Saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit, tie, and thick-rimmed glasses: a look similar to that of Temptations singer <a href="David%20Ruffin">David Ruffin</a>. According to Saadiq, the photo "set the tone for the whole album ... me singing that song, me wearing that suit, it said everything that this album should be." Music journalist <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> believed the cover "evokes the dramatic portraits and color schemes of old-school jazz and soul albums. Think <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> on <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Sonny%20Rollins">Sonny Rollins</a> on <a href="Blue%20Note%20Records">Blue Note</a>, <a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Dave">Sam and Dave</a> on Stax ... With arms raised, he looks like he's testifying as much as singing." The rest of the album's packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson-tinted cover's font and 1960s Columbia Records logo. The packaging's photography was taken by <a href="Norman%20Seeff">Norman Seeff</a>.

Before completing "The Way I See It", Saadiq previewed its songs in May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing strategy for the record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as <a href="gramophone%20record">vinyl records</a>. He felt that "nobody at the label knew" him in an interview with "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>": "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a <a href="wikt%3Aslow%20burn">slow burn</a> because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at <a href="WVEE">V-103</a>'s For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on "<a href="VH1%20Soul">VH1 Soul</a>stage". Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition <a href="box%20set">box set</a> with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a "Euro version" of "Big Easy" and the song "Come On Home".

"The Way I See It" was largely overlooked by consumers upon its release. The album debuted at number 19 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, selling 23,000 copies in the week of October 4. Nonetheless, it was Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States at the time, and by November, had steadily sold 76,919 copies. Five <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released from the album—"Love That Girl" on August 5, 2008, "100 Yard Dash" on March 30, 2009, "Never Give You Up" on May 27, "Let's Take a Walk" on August 7, and "Staying in Love" on October 5. "Love That Girl", "Never Give You Up", and "Staying in Love" all charted on the US <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a>, peaking at number 45, number 26, and number 74, respectively. During 2009, Saadiq travelled for promotional television appearances and press in Europe, where "The Way I See It" had charted in several countries. In France, the record spent 51 weeks on the country's albums chart, peaking at number 13 in the week of February 24. In August, it re-entered the American chart at number 101 and had sold 215,000 copies. The album charted for 41 weeks on the "Billboard" 200, serving as the longest chart-run of Saadiq's career. By May 2011, it had sold 282,000 copies, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>.

"The Way I See It" was met with generally positive reviews from critics. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an <a href="weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">average</a> score of 79, based on 20 reviews. 

Reviewing the album for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Caroline Sullivan called it flawlessly produced and performed by Saadiq, while "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's <a href="Will%20Hermes">Will Hermes</a> said the record showcased an original take on classic <a href="Northern%20soul">Northern soul</a>. Andy Gill of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" wrote that it was one of 2008's most captivating albums because "few have managed to retro-fabricate that classic sound so accurately, nor in as many subtle variations" like Saadiq. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Andy Kellman stated, "Here's where a modern master, backed by living and breathing session musicians ... masters the masters with startling accuracy." In "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", <a href="Kitty%20Empire">Kitty Empire</a> found the album "both feather-light and substantial" because of how, "unlike most modern records, Saadiq's tunes gather weight the deeper in you go". Writing for "<a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a>", Christgau said Saadiq sang with Smokey Robinson's detailed sentimentality and <a href="Dennis%20Edwards">Dennis Edwards</a>' amenable personality. He expanded on his praise in "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>", finding that, while "painstakingly retro", Saadiq's achievement "isn't replicating the Motown Sound but writing consistently charming and catchy songs in that style". "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" was more critical, finding the record devoid of a "fresh approach" to elevate it from a simple homage. According to "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" writer Christian John Wikane, "one's total enjoyment of the album depends on their appreciation of classic soul and R&B and whether such appreciation is contingent on absolute authenticity."

At the end of 2008, "The Way I See It" was included in a number of critics' best albums lists. It was named one of the year's 10-best records by the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>", and the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>", which cited it as ninth best. It was also ranked at number five by "<a href="Exclaim%21">Exclaim!</a>", number seven by "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>", number one by <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, number five by "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", number three by "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>", and number two by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>". "The Way I See It" was voted the 18th best album of 2008 in the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"; the poll's singles list had six of the album's songs voted in, including "100 Yard Dash" at number 114 and both "Love That Girl" and "Big Easy" at number 250. Nate Chinen of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" included "100 Yard Dash" in his top-five singles list for 2008. "The Way I See It" also nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award">2009 Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Album">Best R&B Album</a>. "Love That Girl" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Traditional%20R%26amp%3BB%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance</a>, while "Never Give You Up" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocals">Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals</a>.

Saadiq toured for about two years to promote "The Way I See It", performing in venues throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. He was originally apprehensive at the prospect of touring extensively, having toured minimally as a solo act. He reconsidered at the advice of his rhythm guitarist Rob Bacon, which he recounted in an interview for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>": "The money was just OK, so I was like, 'I don't know – I could probably stay home and find something better,' But then Rob reminded me, 'You know, all those cats you love, that's exactly what they did. <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>? He played 10 shows a day at the <a href="Apollo%20Theater">Apollo</a>.' I said, 'OK, let's go.'" To complement his songs' style, Saadiq adopted a vintage soul image and, having studied footage of classic soul groups and album sleeves, donned old-fashioned attire and performed R&B dance moves at shows. He wore a yellow tailored suit, while his nine-piece backing band wore black suits. The band included a horn section and backup singer Erika Jerry.

Before the album's release, Saadiq had toured Europe during the summer in 2008. In November and December, he served as a supporting act for <a href="John%20Legend">John Legend</a>. He also opened for <a href="Seal%20%28musician%29">Seal</a> and the <a href="Dave%20Matthews%20Band">Dave Matthews Band</a>. Throughout his touring in the US and Europe, Saadiq played various music festivals, including <a href="Austin%20City%20Limits%20Music%20Festival">Austin City Limits</a>, <a href="Bonnaroo%20Music%20Festival">Bonnaroo</a>, <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a>, <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a>, <a href="Voodoo%20Experience">Voodoo Experience</a>, <a href="Bumbershoot">Bumbershoot</a>, <a href="Outside%20Lands%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Outside Lands</a>, and <a href="Pori%20Jazz">Pori Jazz</a>. In February 2009, he performed at the <a href="Harvard%20Club%20of%20Boston">Harvard Club of Boston</a> as part of the music television series "<a href="Live%20from%20the%20Artists%20Den">Live from the Artists Den</a>". On June 25, he played the <a href="Blue%20Note%20Tokyo">Blue Note Tokyo</a> in Japan. His performance at the <a href="Bataclan%20%28theatre%29">Bataclan</a> in Paris on July 11 was filmed and released as a DVD, entitled "Live in Paris", in 2010. After a stretch of summer festival performances in 2009, Saadiq embarked on another leg of concerts during November and December, with <a href="Melanie%20Fiona">Melanie Fiona</a>, <a href="Janelle%20Mon%C3%A1e">Janelle Monáe</a>, and <a href="Anjulie">Anjulie</a> as supporting acts. The tour featured dates in North America, but Saadiq also performed at the <a href="Paradiso%20%28Amsterdam%29">Paradiso</a> in Amsterdam on November 13. He continued touring for the album into 2010, including performances at the <a href="JazzReggae%20Festival%20%40%20UCLA">JazzReggae Festival</a> in May, the <a href="Essence%20Music%20Festival">Essence Music Festival</a> in July, and a headlining performance at <a href="Central%20Park%20SummerStage">Central Park SummerStage</a> in August.

"The Way I See It" was an exemplary release of the classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as <a href="Amy%20Winehouse">Amy Winehouse</a> and <a href="Adele">Adele</a>, independent acts such as <a href="Sharon%20Jones%20%26amp%3B%20The%20Dap-Kings">Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings</a> and <a href="Mayer%20Hawthorne">Mayer Hawthorne</a>, and older artists attempting comebacks such as <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a> and <a href="Bettye%20LaVette">Bettye LaVette</a>. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with <a href="Solange%20Knowles">Solange Knowles</a>' 2008 record "<a href="Sol-Angel%20and%20the%20Hadley%20St.%20Dreams">Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams</a>", as one of the "retro-soul" efforts that were released by contemporary R&B artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that "The Way I See It" "showcased a mastery of any number of past R&B styles, including those out of <a href="Memphis%20soul">Memphis</a>, <a href="Muscle%20Shoals%20Sound%20Studio">Muscle Shoals</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="New%20Orleans%20rhythm%20and%20blues">New Orleans</a>, and of course, Detroit." <a href="Estelle%20%28musician%29">Estelle</a> said in 2008, "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." It was described by <a href="David%20Nathan%20%28music%20writer%29">David Nathan</a> as the "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> found it distinct from other soul revival music: "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to <a href="baby%20boomer">baby boomer</a>s. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas."

"The Way I See It" also earned Saadiq the highest international profile of his career. In promoting the album, he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist. His extensive touring in the US and Europe garnered the attention of younger, white audiences who were not exposed to his previous solo albums and work with Tony! Toni! Toné!. "<a href="The%20Press%20of%20Atlantic%20City">The Press of Atlantic City</a>" wrote that the album "brought in a whole new generation of Saadiq fans, with songs such as '100 Yard Dash' striking a chord with even ironic teenagers." According to Gail Mitchell of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", "The Way I See It" helped Saadiq reach "the major-market <a href="Hipster%20%28contemporary%20subculture%29">hipster</a> crowd, music supervisors and festival bookers." He also attained a following among Japanese audiences. Saadiq's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album, "<a href="Stone%20Rollin%27">Stone Rollin'</a>", in 2011, as he noted the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live. It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording "Stone Rollin".

Saadiq called "The Way I See It" "the culmination of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." Kristal Hawkins of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said that he "hit his artistic maturity" with the album. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> remarked on its place in his solo career, "In 1996, Saadiq turned the <a href="House%20of%20Music">climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album</a> into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle <a href="Maxwell%20%28musician%29">Maxwell</a> in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd[id] himself with a fearless return to retro." <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, said that he was "blown away" by "The Way I See It", citing it as "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his <a href="Elton%20John%20AIDS%20Foundation%20Academy%20Award%20Party">AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party</a> in 2009. In an interview for "Blues & Soul", Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and <a href="Lucy%20Pearl">Lucy Pearl</a> – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... "The Way I See It" showed them that yes, I could put the time in still and be an artist!"

Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway

The Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR), also known as the Piccadilly tube, was a railway company established in 1902 that constructed a deep-level underground "tube" railway in London. The GNP&BR was formed through a merger of two older companies, the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR) and the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&SR). It also incorporated part of a tube route planned by a third company, the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> (DR). The combined company was a subsidiary of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL).

The B&PCR and the GN&SR were established in 1896 and 1898 respectively, but construction of both railways was delayed while funding was sought. In 1902 the UERL, which already controlled the DR, took control of both companies and quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors. A number of different routes were planned, but most were rejected by Parliament.

When it opened in 1906, the GNP&BR's line served 22 stations and ran for between its western terminus at <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a> and its northern terminus at <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20%28area%29">Finsbury Park</a>. A short branch connected <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> to the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>. Most of the route was in a pair of tunnels, with at the western end constructed above ground. Within the first year of opening it became apparent to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the GNP&BR and the other UERL lines were over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways, the GNP&BR struggled financially. In 1933 it and the rest of the UERL were taken into <a href="public%20ownership">public ownership</a>. Today, the GNP&BR's tunnels and stations form the core central section of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a>.

In November 1896 notice was published that a <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a> was to be presented to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> for the construction of the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR). The line was planned to run entirely underground between Air Street near <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a> and the south end of <a href="Exhibition%20Road">Exhibition Road</a>, <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>. The route was to run beneath <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, <a href="Brompton%20Road">Brompton Road</a> and <a href="Thurloe%20Square">Thurloe Place</a>, with intermediate stations at <a href="Dover%20Street">Dover Street</a>, Down Street, <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Corner">Hyde Park Corner</a>, Knightsbridge and Brompton Road. A short branch to the east of the South Kensington terminus was planned to a depot south of Brompton Road at the end of Yeoman Row. Electricity to operate the trains was to be provided from a <a href="power%20station">generating station</a> to be built about a mile south of the South Kensington terminus on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> at <a href="Lots%20Road%20Power%20Station">Lots Road</a>, <a href="West%20Brompton">West Brompton</a>. Following parliamentary approval, the bill received <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> as the "Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1897" on 6 August 1897.

Also announced in November 1896 was a bill to be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between <a href="Gloucester%20Road%20tube%20station">Gloucester Road</a> and <a href="Mansion%20House%20tube%20station">Mansion House</a> stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in <a href="Tunnel%23Cut-and-cover">cut and cover</a> tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at <a href="Embankment%20tube%20station">Charing Cross</a> (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at <a href="Earl%27s%20Court%20tube%20station">Earl's Court</a>. Since, like the B&PCR, the DR's <a href="Deep%20level%20underground">deep tube line</a> would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its <a href="Fulham%20Broadway%20tube%20station">Walham Green</a> station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the "Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897".

In November 1898 the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&SR) was announced as a tube railway, to run from <a href="Wood%20Green">Wood Green</a> to Stanhope Street, north of the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>. The GN&SR was backed by the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great Northern Railway</a> (GNR), the main line railway operating from <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross</a> station. The GNR saw the new company as a means of relieving congestion on its route. The GN&SR was to run beneath the GNR's main line from <a href="Alexandra%20Palace%20railway%20station">Wood Green</a> station (now Alexandra Palace) to <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20station">Finsbury Park station</a>. It was then planned to run south-west through <a href="Holloway%2C%20London">Holloway</a> to King's Cross, and then south to <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> and <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a>. Intermediate stations were planned at the GNR's <a href="Hornsey%20railway%20station">Hornsey</a>, <a href="Harringay%20railway%20station">Harringay</a> and Finsbury Park stations, and at Holloway, <a href="York%20Way">York Road</a>, King's Cross, <a href="Russell%20Square">Russell Square</a> and Holborn. A power station was planned next to the GNR's tracks at <a href="Gillespie%20Road">Gillespie Road</a>. When the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> planned the construction of <a href="Kingsway%20%28London%29">Kingsway</a> and <a href="Aldwych">Aldwych</a>, Stanhope Street was scheduled for demolition so the southern terminus was relocated to the junction of the two new roads. The bill was enacted on 1 August 1899 as the "Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1899".

Although the three companies had permission to construct their railways, they still had to raise the <a href="Financial%20capital">capital</a> for the construction works in a competitive market.

By 1899, there were five other tube railway companies with permission to construct railways that were raising funds – the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street and Waterloo Railway</a> (BS&WR), the <a href="Charing%20Cross%2C%20Euston%20and%20Hampstead%20Railway">Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway</a> (CCE&HR), the <a href="Northern%20City%20Line">Great Northern and City Railway</a> (GN&CR), the <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a> (CLR) and the <a href="City%20and%20Brixton%20Railway">City and Brixton Railway</a>. The already operating <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City & South London Railway</a> (C&SLR) was also looking for money for extensions to its existing route and numerous other proposed, but unapproved underground railway companies were also seeking investors.

Foreign investors came to the rescue of the DR, B&PCR and GN&SR: American financier <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a>, who had been lucratively involved in the development of Chicago's <a href="tram">tram</a>way system in the 1880s and 1890s, saw the opportunity to make similar investments in London. In March 1901 he and his backers purchased a majority of the shares of the DR and, in September 1901, took over the B&PCR and the GN&SR. With the companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL to raise funds to build the tube railways and to <a href="electrification">electrify</a> the DR. The UERL was <a href="Market%20capitalization">capitalised</a> at £5 million with the majority of <a href="Share%20%28finance%29">share</a>s sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18 million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.

During the progress of their 1896 bills through parliament, the DR and the B&PCR established a relationship through a successful joint campaign of opposition to a competing proposal from the City & West End Railway. This was for a tube railway running from <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a> to <a href="Cannon%20Street">Cannon Street</a>, which would have duplicated parts of the DR's and the B&PCR's approved routes. In late 1898, this common interest led to the purchase of the B&PCR by the DR. In November 1898 a bill for the B&PCR was announced, which sought permission for short extensions at each end of its route: at its eastern end, from Piccadilly Circus to Cranbourn Street and, at the western end, connections between the B&PCR's tunnels and those of the DR's deep tube line. Parliament rejected the eastern extension, but permitted the connection between the two lines and approved a capital injection from the DR into the B&PCR. The bill received royal assent on 9 August 1899 as the "Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (Extensions) Act, 1899".

In November 1899 the DR published a notice of a bill for the 1900 parliamentary session. The company was still unable to proceed with the construction of its proposed deep line, and the new bill included provisions for extensions of time for this line and for those of the B&PCR. The bill included construction and operation of the power station at the Lots Road site previously chosen by the B&PCR. The B&PCR also published notice for a bill requesting an extension of time, but this was later withdrawn and the extension request in the DR bill was used. The time extensions were granted in the "Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1900", which received assent on 6 August 1900.

In November 1900 the B&PCR published a notice of a bill for the 1901 session, in which it sought permission for two extensions. The first, eastward, took a more northerly route than the rejected 1899 extension to Cranbourn Street: it was to run via <a href="Shaftesbury%20Avenue">Shaftesbury Avenue</a>, Hart Street (now Bloomsbury Way), <a href="Bloomsbury%20Square">Bloomsbury Square</a>, Theobalds Road and Rosebery Avenue, to <a href="Angel%2C%20London">Angel</a>, <a href="Islington">Islington</a> where it terminated under <a href="Islington%20High%20Street">Islington High Street</a>. Where the line crossed other tube routes, stations were planned: at <a href="Cambridge%20Circus%2C%20London">Cambridge Circus</a> to interchange with the planned CCE&HR, and at <a href="Museum%20Street">Museum Street</a> near to the CLR's recently opened <a href="British%20Museum%20tube%20station">British Museum</a> station. The second extension took the line south-west from South Kensington, via <a href="Fulham%20Road">Fulham Road</a>, to connect to the DR's line south of Walham Green station (now <a href="Fulham%20Broadway%20tube%20station">Fulham Broadway</a>). The bill also included provisions for the B&PCR to take over responsibility for construction of the section of the DR's deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court, and for a further extension of time.

The opening of the CLR on 30 July 1900 had stimulated interest in underground railways, and the B&PCR's bill was submitted to Parliament at the same time as a large number of other bills for tube lines in the capital. To review these bills, Parliament established a joint committee under <a href="Robert%20Windsor-Clive%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Plymouth">Lord Windsor</a>. Only the part of B&PCR's first extension as far as Museum Street was considered by the committee. The section to The Angel was held back, pending the findings of a separate committee which was investigating problems of vibration experienced on the CLR. The extension to Fulham was not discussed. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over so the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session.

In November 1901 the B&PCR published details of its bill for the 1902 session. The extension to The Angel was dropped, and a different route eastwards from Piccadilly Circus was planned. Once again this ran to Cranbourn Street, but it continued under <a href="Long%20Acre%20%28street%29">Long Acre</a> and <a href="Great%20Queen%20Street">Great Queen Street</a> to meet and connect to the GN&SR's tunnels at Little Queen Street (now the northern part of Kingsway) just south of the GN&SR's planned Holborn station. The B&PCR planned stations at <a href="Wardour%20Street">Wardour Street</a>, Cranbourn Street and <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>.

At Wardour Street station a branch was to leave the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have platforms on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, <a href="Drayton%20Gardens">Drayton Gardens</a>, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green before coming to the surface and running parallel with the DR as far as <a href="Parsons%20Green%20tube%20station">Parsons Green</a>, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B&PCR and the GN&SR were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B&PCR to change its name.

At the same time, the GN&SR published details of its bill for the 1902 session. The GN&SR sought powers for a short extension of about from its southern terminus, to <a href="Temple%20tube%20station">Temple</a> station on the DR's existing sub-surface line where an interchange was planned. The GN&SR also sought permission to abandon the section of its route north of Finsbury Park, and to transfer its powers and obligations to the B&PCR as part of the merger. The DR also announced a bill for 1902 which included provisions to transfer responsibility for part or all of its deep-level line to the B&PCR.

The B&PCR bill was again examined by a joint committee under Lord Windsor. The GN&SR bill was examined by a separate committee under <a href="Thomas%20Lister%2C%204th%20Baron%20Ribblesdale">Lord Ribblesdale</a>. The B&PCR's eastward extension to Holborn to connect to the GN&SR was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following objections from hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B&PCR link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected on the grounds that it involved sharp turns and steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN&SR and name change were permitted. The GN&SR's extension to Temple was rejected following objections from the <a href="Henry%20Fitzalan-Howard%2C%2015th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> who owned the land under which it would have run. The abandonment of the route north of Finsbury Park was permitted.

The bills received royal assent as the "Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1902" and the "Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1902" on 8 August 1902, and as the "Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1902" on 18 November 1902.

In November 1902 the newly merged company announced two bills for the 1903 parliamentary session under the GNP&BR name. The first bill requested minor powers which included the purchase of additional land for stations, and sought minor amendments to previous Acts.

The second bill sought permission for extensions east and west from the approved route. The eastern extension was to diverge from the main route immediately west of Piccadilly Circus station, which was to be expanded to have east and westbound platforms on both lines. The extension was then to pass under <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a> to a station at Charing Cross. Continuing eastwards under <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>, the tunnels were to cross under the branch from Holborn, with an interchange at Strand station. The line was then to continue under <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a> to <a href="Ludgate%20Circus">Ludgate Circus</a>, where a station was to be constructed to interchange with the <a href="London%2C%20Chatham%20and%20Dover%20Railway">London, Chatham and Dover Railway</a>'s <a href="Ludgate%20Hill%20railway%20station">Ludgate Hill station</a> (since demolished). It would then proceed south under New Bridge Street, and east under <a href="Queen%20Victoria%20Street%2C%20London">Queen Victoria Street</a>, to connect to the DR's proposed deep-level line west of Mansion House station. The western extension was to diverge from the approved route at Albert Gate, east of Knightsbridge station. This station was to have additional platforms on the new branch line which would head west under <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, <a href="Kensington%20Road">Kensington Road</a> and <a href="Kensington%20High%20Street">Kensington High Street</a>, with stations at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, the DR's <a href="High%20Street%20Kensington%20tube%20station">High Street Kensington</a> station and <a href="Addison%20Road%2C%20London">Addison Road</a>. The tunnels were then to follow <a href="Hammersmith%20Road">Hammersmith Road</a> to the DR's <a href="Hammersmith%20tube%20station%20%28Piccadilly%20and%20District%20lines%29">Hammersmith</a> station. There they would turn north under Hammersmith Grove and east under Goldhawk Road, to terminate on the south side of <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush">Shepherd's Bush Green</a> near to the CLR's <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20tube%20station">Shepherd's Bush</a> terminus.

The DR also publicised two further bills for the 1903 session. The first included provisions to formalise the agreement for the GNP&BR to build the section of the deep-level line between South Kensington and West Kensington, including the deep-level platforms at Earl's Court. The second bill sought permission to extend the deep-level line from its eastern end at Mansion House by following beneath the existing sub-surface tracks to <a href="Whitechapel%20tube%20station">Whitechapel</a>, where the line would connect to the existing sub-surface lines to <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a>.

Neither extension bill was debated. In February 1903, Parliament had established a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> on London Traffic to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed. Both bills were later withdrawn by their promoters. The powers bills were approved as the "Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1903" on 21 July 1903 and the "Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1903" on 11 August 1903.

The Royal Commission investigations continued from 1903 to early 1905, concluding with the issue of a report in June 1905. No bills were submitted for the 1904 parliamentary session, but in November 1904 the GNP&BR announced two bills for the 1905 session.

The first dealt with the Strand branch: it confirmed the layout of the junction between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> to the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a>'s (L&SWR's) terminus at <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">Waterloo station</a>. The extension included moving Strand station to the corner of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS&WR's <a href="Waterloo%20tube%20station">Waterloo station</a> which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP&BR's platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the "Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905".

The second bill again proposed extensions to the east and west, modifying the 1903 plans. In the east, the route was the same as the previous proposal as far as Ludgate Circus. Then, instead of heading south under New Bridge Street and east into Queen Victoria Street to connect to the DR deep level route, the 1905 proposal followed under Carter Lane and <a href="Cannon%20Street">Cannon Street</a> to a station at the junction of Queen Street and Watling Street, a short distance north-east of the DR's Mansion House station. The route then followed Queen Victoria Street to <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street</a> where an interchange was to be provided with the C&SLR and the CLR at <a href="Bank%E2%80%93Monument%20station">Bank station</a>. The route continued under <a href="Cornhill%2C%20London">Cornhill</a> and <a href="Leadenhall%20Street">Leadenhall Street</a> to end at <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a> High Street, adjacent to the DR's <a href="Aldgate%20tube%20station">Aldgate station</a>.

To the west, the 1903 proposed extension from Knightsbridge to Hammersmith via Kensington High Street remained, but it was to continue beyond Hammersmith under King Street, the final station being at the junction of King Street, Goldhawk Road and Chiswick High Road. The tunnels were to continue beyond the final station for a further under Chiswick High Road, to end at the junction with Homefield Road. The loop north from Hammersmith to Shepherd's Bush was dropped; instead a more direct route to Shepherd's Bush was proposed as a branch from the Hammersmith extension at Addison Road. It was to run under Holland Road to Shepherd's Bush Green, with a station being constructed opposite the CLR station there. It would then continue west under <a href="Uxbridge%20Road">Uxbridge Road</a> to <a href="Acton%20Vale%2C%20London">Acton Vale</a>, where a depot was to be built on the surface between Agnes Road and Davis Road. To cover the cost of the proposed extensions, powers to raise further capital of £4.2 million were sought. The review of the bill in Parliament was delayed as the Royal Commission was still sitting during the first half of 1905; the bill was withdrawn by the GNP&BR in July 1905, as insufficient time then remained for completion the parliamentary process before the end of the session.

With the funds available from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B&PCR and GN&SR. Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that track laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect <a href="Leslie%20Green">Leslie Green</a> in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed <a href="glazed%20architectural%20terra-cotta">terracotta</a> blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were close enough to the surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four <a href="elevator">lifts</a> and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.

Works on the main route were largely complete by the Autumn of 1906, and after a period of test running the railway was ready to open in December 1906. As a result of the electrification and resignalling of the DR's surface and sub-surface tracks in 1905, the capacity of the existing route was sufficiently increased that the construction of deep-level tunnels east of South Kensington was unnecessary, and the powers were allowed to lapse.

The official opening of the GNP&BR by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, took place on 15 December 1906. Progress on the Strand branch was delayed, and it opened in November 1907. From its opening, the GNP&BR was generally known by the abbreviated names "Piccadilly Tube" or "Piccadilly Railway", and the names appeared on the station buildings and on contemporary maps of the tube lines.

The railway had stations at:

The service was provided by a fleet of <a href="Coach%20%28rail%29">carriages</a> manufactured for the UERL in France and Hungary. These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS&WR and the CCE&HR, and operated as <a href="electric%20multiple%20unit">electric multiple unit</a> trains without the need for separate locomotives. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at each end of cars; these gates were operated by Gate-men who rode on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design became known on the Underground as the <a href="London%20Underground%201906%20Stock">1906 stock</a> or <a href="London%20Underground%201906%20Stock">Gate stock</a>. Trains for the line were stabled at the <a href="Lillie%20Bridge%20Depot">Lillie Bridge Depot</a> in West Kensington.

Despite the UERL's success in financing and constructing the railway in only seven years, its opening did not bring the financial success that had been expected. In the Piccadilly Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 26 million passengers, less than half of the 60 million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.

The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.

From 1907, in an effort to improve their finances, the UERL, the C&SLR, the CLR and the GN&CR began to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the "Underground". The W&CR was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement as it was owned by the mainline L&SWR.

The UERL's three tube railway companies were still legally separate entities, with their own management, shareholder and dividend structures. There was duplicated administration between the three companies and, to streamline the management and reduce expenditure, the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Piccadilly, the Hampstead and the Bakerloo Tubes into a single entity, the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> (LER), although the lines retained their own individual branding. The bill received royal assent on 26 July 1910 as the "London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act, 1910". This took effect on 1 July that year.

In October 1911, the Piccadilly tube platforms at Earl's Court station became the first on the Underground network to be served by <a href="escalator">escalator</a>s when a link between the District and Piccadilly platforms was created.

In November 1912, a bill was publicised under the LER name that included a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L&SWR's <a href="Richmond%2C%20London">Richmond</a> branch tracks. The District line already ran trains over this route, and the Piccadilly tube service would provide additional connections. The bill received assent as the "London Electric Railway Act, 1913" on 15 August 1913. The advent of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.

Despite improvements made to other parts of the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.

In an effort to protect the UERL group's income, its chairman <a href="Albert%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashfield">Lord Ashfield</a> <a href="lobbying">lobbied</a> the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>lor (later <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a> and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport%23Minister%20of%20Transport%20%281919%E2%80%931941%29">Minister of Transport</a>) <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">LCC's</a> tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board%23London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Area">London Passenger Transport Area</a>. The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full <a href="nationalization">nationalisation</a> – and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were <a href="liquidation">liquidated</a>.

The original GNP&BR route was extended at both ends in the early 1930s. In the north, a new route was constructed to <a href="Wood%20Green">Wood Green</a>, <a href="Southgate%2C%20London">Southgate</a> and <a href="Cockfosters">Cockfosters</a>. In the west, the extension from Hammersmith approved in 1913 was finally carried out. The extension paralleled the District line's route to <a href="Acton%2C%20London">Acton</a> and <a href="Hounslow">Hounslow</a>, and took over the District line's route to <a href="Uxbridge">Uxbridge</a>. In 1977, the Hounslow branch was extended to <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>. The Strand branch was closed in 1994. Today, the GNP&BR's tunnels form the core of the Piccadilly line's route.

York Road, Down Street and Brompton Road stations were closed in the early 1930s due to low usage, but in the lead-up to World War II the underground passageways at Down Street and Brompton Road were considered useful as protected deep shelters for critical government and military operations. Down Street was fitted out for use by the <a href="Railway%20Executive%20Committee">Railway Executive Committee</a> and the <a href="War%20Cabinet%23Second%20World%20War">War Cabinet</a>. Brompton Road was used as a control centre for anti-aircraft operations, and after the war was used by the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>. Between September 1940 and July 1946, the Strand branch was temporarily closed, its tunnels used to store exhibits from the British Museum as well as serving as an air-raid shelter.

On November 18, 1868, just two weeks after the election, Ellen Maria Wade married the man who had defeated her uncle, Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Wade">Benjamin Franklin Wade</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, in the race for the Republican vice presidential nomination. They had one son, Schuyler Colfax III, in April 1870.

Her husband, <a href="Schuyler%20Colfax">Schuyler Colfax</a> was inaugurated as the 17th Vice President on March 4, 1869, and served until March 4, 1873. Likewise, Ellen Maria Colfax became the Second Lady of the United States.

She died at her home in South Bend, Indiana in 1911 after a period of poor health, on the 42nd anniversary of her husband's assumption of the vice-presidency. She was survived by her son Schuyler Colfax III. Her funeral was held March 7, 1911 at the Colfax home, and she was buried next to her husband.

Yugoslav torpedo boat T3

The Yugoslav torpedo boat "T3 was a sea-going <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> that was operated by the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> between 1921 and 1941. Originally 78 T", a of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> built in 1914, she was armed with two guns, four <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, and could carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. She saw active service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, performing <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a> and <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions. Following <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>'s defeat in 1918, she was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed "T3". At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force. 

During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, "T7" and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italians</a> during the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> under her Yugoslav designation, although she was only used for coastal and second-line tasks. Following <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">the Italian capitulation</a> in September 1943, she was captured by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> and, after being fitted with additional <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns, served with the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a> or the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Navy of the Independent State of Croatia</a> as TA48. In German/Croatian service her crew of 52 consisted entirely of <a href="Croats">Croatian</a> officers and enlisted men. She was sunk by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> aircraft in February 1945 while in the port of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, where she had been built.

In 1910, the Austro-Hungarian Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based on expectations that the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, where the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> meets the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, would be <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at the <a href="Cattaro">Cattaro</a> (now Kotor) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. <a href="Steam%20turbine">Steam turbine</a> power was selected for propulsion, as <a href="Marine%20propulsion%23Reciprocating%20diesel%20engines">diesels</a> with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run <a href="Turbo-electric%20transmission">turbo-electric</a> boats. <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> (STT) of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. The T-group designation signified that they were built at Trieste.

The , T-group boats had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, one of which burned <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The T-group had one <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Due to inadequate funding, "78 T" and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them.

The boats were originally to be armed with three <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20guns"></a> L/30 guns, and three torpedo tubes, but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed, to standardise the armament with the F-group to follow. They could also carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. The fifth of its class to be built, "78 T" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 22 October 1913, <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 4 March 1914, and completed on 23 August 1914. Later that year, one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> was added.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "78 T" was used for <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort, <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a> and <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions. She also conducted patrols and supported <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> raids against the Italian Adriatic coast. On 24 May 1915, "78 T" and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Ancona">Bombardment of Ancona</a>, with "78 T" involved in the shelling of <a href="Port%20of%20Ravenna">Porto Corsini</a> near <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>. In the latter action, an Italian <a href="coastal%20artillery">shore battery</a> returned fire, hitting the <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a> and damaging one of the other 250t-class boats. On 23 July, "78 T" and another 250t-class boat participated in a shore bombardment and landing operation led by "Novara"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> against <a href="San%20Benedetto%20del%20Tronto">San Benedetto del Tronto</a>, <a href="Ortona">Ortona</a> and <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a> on the central Adriatic coast of Italy. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at <a href="Pula">Pola</a> to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was "78 T". This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.

On 6 February 1916, the scout cruiser , "78 T" and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser and French <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> north of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durazzo</a> in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. In 1917, one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. On 11 May 1917, the British <a href="submarine">submarine</a> stalked "78 T" off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's <a href="periscope">periscope</a> extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale "feather" had alerted the crew of "78 T", allowing her crew to avoid the incoming torpedoes. That night, the , accompanied by "78 T" and two other 250t-class boats, were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 23 September, "77 T" and "78 T" were laying a minefield off <a href="Grado%2C%20Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia">Grado</a> in the northern Adriatic when they had a brief encounter with an Italian <a href="MAS%20%28motorboat%29">MAS boat</a>. On 28 November, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, "78 T" joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of Porto Corsini, <a href="Marotta%20%28village%29">Marotta</a> and <a href="Cesenatico">Cesenatico</a>. By 1918, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">German</a> and Austro-Hungarian <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s to get through the strait and into the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a>, decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, scout cruisers, and destroyers.

During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s and . At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the <a href="boom%20%28navigational%20barrier%29">harbour defence barrage</a> opened, the dreadnoughts and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including "78 T", also departed Pola and set course for <a href="Slano">Slano</a>, north of <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a>, to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the <a href="Otranto%20Barrage">Otranto Barrage</a>. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, two <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> () MAS boats, "MAS 15" and "MAS 21", spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. "MAS 21" attacked "Tegetthoff", but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of <a href="Luigi%20Rizzo">Luigi Rizzo</a>, "MAS 15" fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit "Szent István". Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on "Szent István" were abreast her <a href="fire%20room">boiler rooms</a>, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. "Szent István" <a href="capsizing">capsized</a> less than three hours after being torpedoed.

"78 T" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> by which <a href="Republic%20of%20German-Austria">rump Austria</a> officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class, T-group boats, "76 T", "77 T" and "79 T", and four F-group boats she served with the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">KSCS Navy</a> (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy, , KJRM; Краљевска Југословенска Ратна Морнарица). Transferred in March 1921, in KJRM service, "78 T" was renamed "T3". At the time of her transfer, she and the other 250t-class torpedo boats were the only modern sea-going warships in the Yugoslav fleet. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May–June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "<a href="SMS%20Niobe">Dalmacija</a>", the <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a> "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta">Malta</a>, the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the Ionian Sea, and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. It is not clear if "T5" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attaché was reporting that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when it was <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. At the time of the invasion, "T3" was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her sister ship <a href="Yugoslav%20torpedo%20boat%20T1">"T1"</a>, several <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s and other craft. "T3" was captured in port by the Royal Italian Navy and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation. She was fitted with two L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of her 66 mm guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. Due to her obsolescence, the Italians only used "T3" for coastal and second-line duties.

When the Italians <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulated</a> in September 1943, the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a> () seized "T3" in the port of <a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a> and renamed her TA48. She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic. The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes. She was either crewed exclusively by <a href="Croats">Croat</a> officers and sailors but remained under German control, or was transferred to the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Navy of the Independent State of Croatia</a> but then repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 due to the unreliable nature of the Croatian personnel. Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German/Croatian service. She was active in the northern Adriatic but saw little action. She was sunk in the port of Trieste by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> aircraft on 20 February 1945.

How a Mosquito Operates

How a Mosquito Operates is a 1912 <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> animated film by American cartoonist <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. The six-minute short depicts a giant <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> tormenting a sleeping man. The film is one of the earliest works of animation, and its technical quality is considered far ahead of its contemporaries. It is also known under the titles The Story of a Mosquito and Winsor McCay and his Jersey Skeeters.

McCay had a reputation for his proficient drawing skills, best remembered in the elaborate cartooning of the children's comic strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>" he began in 1905. He delved into the emerging art of animation with the film <a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">"Little Nemo"</a> (1911), and followed its success by adapting an episode of his comic strip "<a href="Dream%20of%20the%20Rarebit%20Fiend">Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</a>" into "How a Mosquito Operates". McCay gave the film a more coherent story and more developed characterization than in the "Nemo" film, with naturalistic timing, motion, and weight in the animation.

"How a Mosquito Operates" had an enthusiastic reception when McCay first showed it as part of his <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act. He further developed the <a href="character%20animation">character animation</a> he introduced in "Mosquito" with his best-known animated work, "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>" (1914).

A man looks around apprehensively before entering his room. A giant <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> with a top hat and briefcase flies in after him through a <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a>. It repeatedly feeds on the sleeping man, who tries in vain to shoo it away. The mosquito eventually drinks itself so full that it explodes.

"How a Mosquito Operates" is one of the earliest examples of line-drawn animation. McCay used minimal backgrounds and capitalized on strengths of the film medium, then in its infancy, by focusing on the physical, visual action of the characters. No <a href="intertitle">intertitle</a>s interrupt the silent visuals.

Rather than merely expanding like a balloon, as the mosquito drinks its abdomen fills consistent with its bodily structure in a naturalistic way. The heavier it becomes, the more difficulty it has keeping its balance. In its excitement as it feeds, it does push-ups on the man's nose and flips its hat in the air. The mosquito has a personality: egotistical, persistent, and calculating (as when it whets its proboscis on a stone wheel). It makes eye contact with the viewers and <a href="Fourth%20wall">waves at them</a>. McCay balances horror with humor, as when the mosquito finds itself so engorged with blood that it must lie down.

<a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a> (–1934) developed prodigiously accurate and detailed drawing skills early in life. As a young man, he earned a living drawing portraits and posters in <a href="dime%20museum">dime museum</a>s, and attracted large crowds with his ability to draw quickly in public. McCay began working as a full-time newspaper illustrator in 1898, and started drawing comic strips in 1903. His greatest comic-strip success was the children's fantasy "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>", which he launched in 1905. McCay began performing on the <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> circuit the following year, doing <a href="chalk%20talk">chalk talk</a>s—performances in which he drew in front of a live audience.

Inspired by <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>s his son <a href="Bob%20McCay">Robert</a> brought home, McCay said he "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures" of his cartoons. He declared himself "the first man in the world to make animated cartoons", though the American <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">James Stuart Blackton</a> and the French <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a> were among those who had made earlier ones, and McCay had photographed his first animated short under Blackton's supervision. McCay featured his "Little Nemo" characters in <a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">the film</a>, which debuted in movie theatres in 1911, and he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act.

The animated sequences in "Little Nemo" have no plot: much like the early experiments of Émile Cohl, McCay used his first film to demonstrate the medium's capabilities—with fanciful sequences demonstrating motion for its own sake. In "Mosquito" he wanted greater believability, and balanced outlandish action with naturalistic timing, motion, and weight. Since he had already demonstrated in his first film that pictures could be made to move, in the second he introduced a simple story.

Vaudeville acts and humor magazines commonly joked about large New Jersey mosquitoes they called "Jersey skeeters", and McCay had used mosquitoes in his comic strips—including a "Little Nemo" episode in which a swarm of mosquitoes attack Nemo after he returns from a trip to Mars. McCay took the idea for the film from a June 5, 1909, episode of his comic strip "<a href="Dream%20of%20the%20Rarebit%20Fiend">Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</a>", in which a mosquito (without top hat or briefcase) gorges itself on an alcoholic until it becomes so bloated and drunk that it cannot fly away.

McCay began working on the film in May 1911. Shortly after, he left the employ of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>" for the newspapers of <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>—a sign of his rising stardom. A magazine advertisement in July announced a "moving picture, containing six thousand sketches ... will be a 'release' for vaudeville next season by Mr. McCay. The film will be named "How a Mosquito Operates"."

McCay made the drawings on translucent <a href="rice%20paper">rice paper</a>. The film came before the development of <a href="cel">cel</a> animation, in which animators draw on clear sheets of celluloid and lay them over static backgrounds. Thus, on each drawing McCay had to redraw the background, which appears to waver slightly due to the difficulty of reproducing it perfectly each time. McCay re-used some of the drawings to <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animation%20loops">loop repeated actions</a>, a technique he used once in "Little Nemo" and more extensively in his later films.

McCay finished drawing the film in December 1911. A snowstorm hit when he was to have the drawings taken to <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> for photographing, so he hired an enclosed horse-drawn taxi to have them taken there. It disappeared, and a few days later the police found the abandoned taxi with the drawings unharmed inside, the horses two to three miles away. The first attempt to shoot the artwork resulted in unacceptable amounts of flicker due the <a href="Arc%20lamp">arc lighting</a> the studio used, and it was re-shot. The completed work came to 600 <a href="Footage">feet of film</a>.

"How a Mosquito Operates" debuted in January 1912 as part of McCay's vaudeville act, which he toured through that spring and summer. Film producer <a href="Carl%20Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a> bought the distribution rights under the restriction that he not have the film shown in the US until McCay had finished using it in his vaudeville act. Universal–Jewel released the film in 1916 under the title "Winsor McCay and his Jersey Skeeters", and it has sometimes been called "The Story of a Mosquito".

In a lost live-action prologue, McCay and his daughter, "pestered to death by mosquitoes" at their summer home in New Jersey, find a professor who speaks the insects' language. The professor tells McCay to "make a series of drawings to illustrate just how the insect does its deadly work", and after months of work McCay invites the professor to watch the film.

"How a Mosquito Operates" was released at a time when audience demand for animation outstripped the studios' ability to supply it. According to animator Chris Webster, at a time when most studios struggled to make animation merely work, McCay showed a mastery of the medium and a sense of how to create believable motion.

The film opened to large audiences, and was well received. The "<a href="Detroit%20Times">Detroit Times</a>" described audiences laughing until they cried, and "[going] home feeling that [they] had seen one of the best programs" in the theater's history. The paper called the film "a marvelous arrangement of colored drawings", referring to the final explosive sequence, which McCay had hand-painted red (colored versions of this sequence have not survived). The New York "<a href="The%20Morning%20Telegraph">Morning Telegraph</a>" remarked, "[McCay's] moving pictures of his drawings have caused even film magnates to marvel at their cleverness and humor". Audiences found his animation so lifelike that they suggested he had traced the characters from photographs or resorting to tricks using wires:

To show that he had not used such tricks, McCay chose a creature for his next film that could not have been photographed: a "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>". The film, "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>", debuted as part of his vaudeville act in 1914. Before he brought out "Gertie", he hinted at the film's subject in interviews in which he spoke of animation's potential for "serious and educational work".

American animator <a href="John%20Randolph%20Bray">John Randolph Bray</a>'s first film, "The Artist's Dream", appeared in 1913; it alternates live-action and animated sequences, and features a dog that explodes after eating too many sausages. Though these aspects recall McCay's first two films, Bray said that he did not know of McCay's efforts while working on "The Artist's Dream".

Following "Mosquito", animated films tended to be story-based; for decades they rarely drew attention to the technology underlying it, and live-action sequences became infrequent. Animator and McCay biographer <a href="John%20Canemaker">John Canemaker</a> commended McCay for his ability to imbue a mosquito with character and personality, and stated the technical quality of McCay's animation was far ahead of its time, unmatched until the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Disney studios</a> gained prominence in the 1930s with films such as "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" (1937).

Pendle witches

The trials of the Pendle witches in 1612 are among the most famous <a href="Witch-hunt">witch trials</a> in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century. The twelve accused lived in the area surrounding <a href="Pendle%20Hill">Pendle Hill</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. All but two were tried at <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a> <a href="Assizes">Assizes</a> on 18–19 August 1612, along with the <a href="Samlesbury%20witches">Samlesbury witches</a> and others, in a series of trials that have become known as the Lancashire witch trials. One was tried at <a href="York">York</a> Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison. Of the eleven who went to trial – nine women and two men – ten were found guilty and executed by hanging; one was found not guilty.

The official publication of the proceedings by the <a href="clerk%20to%20the%20court">clerk to the court</a>, Thomas Potts, in his "<a href="The%20Wonderfull%20Discoverie%20of%20Witches%20in%20the%20Countie%20of%20Lancaster">The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster</a>", and the number of witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time. It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.

Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each at the time headed by a woman in her eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her daughter Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, <a href="Alice%20Nutter%20%28witch%29">Alice Nutter</a>, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion.

The accused witches lived in the area around <a href="Pendle%20Hill">Pendle Hill</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, a county which, at the end of the 16th century, was regarded by the authorities as a wild and lawless region: an area "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". The nearby <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> abbey at <a href="Whalley%20Abbey">Whalley</a> had been <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolved</a> by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> in 1537, a move strongly resisted by the local people, over whose lives the abbey had until then exerted a powerful influence. Despite the abbey's closure, and the execution of its abbot, the people of Pendle remained largely faithful to their <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> beliefs and were quick to revert to Catholicism on <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary's</a> accession to the throne in 1553.

When Mary's Protestant half-sister <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth</a> came to the throne in 1558 Catholic priests once again had to go into hiding, but in remote areas such as Pendle they continued to celebrate <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> in secret. In 1562, early in her reign, Elizabeth passed a law in the form of "<a href="Witchcraft%20Act%201562">An Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts</a>" (5 Eliz. I c. 16). This demanded the death penalty, but only where harm had been caused; lesser offences were punishable by a term of imprisonment. The Act provided that anyone who should "use, practise, or exercise any Witchcraft, Enchantment, Charm, or Sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed", was guilty of a felony without <a href="benefit%20of%20clergy">benefit of clergy</a>, and was to be put to death.

On Elizabeth's death in 1603 she was succeeded by <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a>. Strongly influenced by Scotland's separation from the Catholic Church during the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Scottish Reformation</a>, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced that he was being plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the <a href="North%20Berwick%20witch%20trials">North Berwick witches</a>, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife <a href="Anne%20of%20Denmark">Anne</a> back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, "<a href="Daemonologie">Daemonologie</a>", instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.

In early 1612, the year of the trials, every <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a> (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of <a href="recusant">recusant</a>s in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take <a href="Eucharist">communion</a>, a criminal offence at that time. Roger Nowell of <a href="Read%20Hall%20and%20Park">Read Hall</a>, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a <a href="peddler">pedlar</a>, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.

It was perhaps difficult for the judges charged with hearing the trials – Sir <a href="James%20Altham">James Altham</a> and Sir Edward Bromley – to understand King James's attitude towards witchcraft. The king was head of the judiciary, and Bromley was hoping for promotion to a circuit nearer London. Altham was nearing the end of his judicial career, but he had recently been accused of a miscarriage of justice at the York Assizes, which had resulted in a woman being sentenced to death by hanging for witchcraft. The judges may have been uncertain whether the best way to gain the King's favour was by encouraging convictions, or by "sceptically testing the witnesses to destruction".

One of the accused, Demdike, had been regarded in the area as a witch for fifty years, and some of the deaths the witches were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event that seems to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.

On her way to <a href="Trawden%20Forest">Trawden Forest</a>, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, encountered John Law, a pedlar from <a href="Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Halifax</a>, and asked him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for <a href="love%20magic">love magic</a>, which may have been why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father a few days after the incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.

Alizon Device, her mother Elizabeth, and her brother James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, and that she had told him to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, something that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into <a href="Malkin%20Tower">Malkin Tower</a>, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £117 as of 2018. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.

On 2 April 1612, Demdike, Chattox, and Chattox's daughter Anne Redferne, were summoned to appear before Nowell. Both Demdike and Chattox were by then blind and in their eighties, and both provided Nowell with damaging confessions. Demdike claimed that she had given her soul to the Devil 20 years previously, and Chattox that she had given her soul to "a Thing like a Christian man", on his promise that "she would not lack anything and would get any revenge she desired". Although Anne Redferne made no confession, Demdike said that she had seen her making clay figures. Margaret Crooke, another witness seen by Nowell that day, claimed that her brother had fallen sick and died after having had a disagreement with Redferne, and that he had frequently blamed her for his illness Based on the evidence and confessions he had obtained, Nowell committed Demdike, Chattox, Anne Redferne and Alizon Device to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for "<a href="Maleficium%20%28sorcery%29">maleficium</a>" – causing harm by witchcraft – at the next assizes.

The committal and subsequent trial of the four women might have been the end of the matter, had it not been for a meeting organised by Elizabeth Device at Malkin Tower, the home of the Demdikes, held on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> 10 April 1612. To feed the party, James Device stole a neighbour's sheep.

Friends and others sympathetic to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine the purpose of the meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, <a href="Alice%20Nutter%20%28witch%29">Alice Nutter</a>, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.

Malkin Tower is believed to have been near the village of <a href="Newchurch%20in%20Pendle">Newchurch in Pendle</a>, or possibly in <a href="Blacko">Blacko</a> on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm, and to have been demolished soon after the trials.

The Pendle witches were tried in a group that also included the <a href="Samlesbury%20witches">Samlesbury witches</a>, Jane Southworth, Jennet Brierley, and Ellen Brierley, the charges against whom included <a href="infanticide">child murder</a>, <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>; Margaret Pearson, the so-called <a href="Padiham%20witch">Padiham witch</a>, who was facing her third trial for witchcraft, this time for killing a horse; and Isobel Robey from <a href="Windle%2C%20St%20Helens">Windle</a>, accused of using witchcraft to cause sickness.

Some of the accused Pendle witches, such as Alizon Device, seem to have genuinely believed in their guilt, but others protested their innocence to the end. Jennet Preston was the first to be tried, at York Assizes.

Jennet Preston lived in <a href="Gisburn">Gisburn</a>, which was then in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, so she was sent to York Assizes for trial. Her judges were Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley. Jennet was charged with the murder by witchcraft of a local landowner, Thomas Lister of Westby Hall, to which she pleaded not guilty. She had already appeared before Bromley in 1611, accused of murdering a child by witchcraft, but had been found not guilty. The most damning evidence given against her was that when she had been taken to see Lister's body, the corpse "bled fresh bloud presently, in the presence of all that were there present" after she touched it. According to a statement made to Nowell by James Device on 27 April, Jennet had attended the Malkin Tower meeting to seek help with Lister's murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to death by <a href="hanging">hanging</a>; her execution took place on 29 July on the <a href="Knavesmire">Knavesmire</a>, the present site of York Racecourse.

All the other accused lived in Lancashire, so they were sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The prosecutor was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something that would not have been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his "Daemonologie". As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.

Nine of the accused – Alizon Device, Elizabeth Device, James Device, Anne Whittle, Anne Redferne, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock and Jane Bulcock – were found guilty during the two-day trial and hanged at Gallows Hill in Lancaster on 20 August 1612; Elizabeth Southerns died while awaiting trial. Only one of the accused, Alice Grey, was found not guilty.

18 August

Anne Whittle (Chattox) was accused of the murder of Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the confession she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.
Elizabeth Device was charged with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, together with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that "this odious witch" suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked to stand up and give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a <a href="Familiar%20spirit">familiar</a> called Ball, who appeared in the shape of a brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.

James Device pleaded not guilty to the murders by witchcraft of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.

19 August

The trials of the three <a href="Samlesbury%20witches">Samlesbury witches</a> were heard before Anne Redferne's first appearance in court, late in the afternoon, charged with the murder of Robert Nutter. The evidence against her was considered unsatisfactory, and she was acquitted.

Anne Redferne was not so fortunate the following day, when she faced her second trial, for the murder of Robert Nutter's father, Christopher, to which she pleaded not guilty. Demdike's statement to Nowell, which accused Anne of having made clay figures of the Nutter family, was read out in court. Witnesses were called to testify that Anne was a witch "more dangerous than her Mother". But she refused to admit her guilt to the end, and had given no evidence against any others of the accused. Anne Redferne was found guilty.

Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, both from <a href="Newchurch%20in%20Pendle">Newchurch in Pendle</a>, were accused and found guilty of the murder by witchcraft of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having been one of those present, and John as having turned the spit to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home.

Alice Nutter was unusual among the accused in being comparatively wealthy, the widow of a tenant <a href="Yeoman%2314th%20to%2018th%20centuries">yeoman</a> farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her plea of not guilty to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother <a href="Robert%20Nutter">Robert</a> in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.

Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) was charged and found guilty of the murder of Anne Foulds. She was the wife of a clothier from <a href="Colne">Colne</a>, and had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting.

Alice Grey was accused with Katherine Hewitt of the murder of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply recording her as one of the Samlesbury witches – which she was not, as she was one of those identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting – and naming her in the list of those found not guilty.

Alizon Device, whose encounter with John Law had triggered the events leading up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to her knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612, when he submitted it for review. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be "truly reported" and "fit and worthie to be published".

Although written as an apparently verbatim account, "The Wonderfull Discoverie" is not a report of what was actually said at the trial but is instead reflecting what happened. Nevertheless, Potts "seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports".

The trials took place not quite seven years after the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> to blow up the Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant aristocracy had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the "preposterous scheme" was invented by the examining magistrates and simply agreed to by James Device in his witness statement. It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated "The Wonderfull Discoverie" to <a href="Thomas%20Knyvet%2C%201st%20Baron%20Knyvet">Thomas Knyvet</a> and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> and thus saving the King.
It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.

Pendle was part of the parish of <a href="Whalley%2C%20Lancashire">Whalley</a>, an area covering , too large to be effective in preaching and teaching the doctrines of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>: both the survival of Catholicism and the upsurge of witchcraft in Lancashire have been attributed to its over-stretched parochial structure. Until its <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution</a>, the spiritual needs of the people of Pendle and surrounding districts had been served by nearby <a href="Whalley%20Abbey">Whalley Abbey</a>, but its closure in 1537 left a moral vacuum.

Many of the allegations made in the Pendle witch trials resulted from members of the Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, it may have been a trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about away, near the village of <a href="Fence%2C%20Lancashire">Fence</a>.

Altham continued with his judicial career until his death in 1617, and Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for "collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Having played her part in the deaths of her mother, brother, and sister, Jennet Device may eventually have found herself accused of witchcraft. A woman with that name was listed in a group of 20 tried at Lancaster Assizes on 24 March 1634, although it cannot be certain that it was the same Jennet Device. The charge against her was the murder of Isabel Nutter, William Nutter's wife. In that series of trials the chief prosecution witness was a ten-year-old boy, <a href="Edmund%20Robinson">Edmund Robinson</a>. All but one of the accused were found guilty, but the judges refused to pass death sentences, deciding instead to refer the case to the king, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Under cross-examination in London, Robinson admitted that he had fabricated his evidence, but even though four of the accused were eventually pardoned, they all remained incarcerated in Lancaster Gaol, where it is likely that they died. An official record dated 22 August 1636 lists Jennet Device as one of those still held in the prison. These later Lancashire witchcraft trials were the subject of a contemporary play written by <a href="Thomas%20Heywood">Thomas Heywood</a> and <a href="Richard%20Brome">Richard Brome</a>, "<a href="The%20Late%20Lancashire%20Witches">The Late Lancashire Witches</a>".

In modern times the witches have become the inspiration for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a>'s <a href="Moorhouse%27s%20Brewery">Moorhouse's</a> produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, and there is a Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by <a href="Burnley%20Bus%20Company">Burnley Bus Company</a> has been branded <a href="The%20Witch%20Way">The Witch Way</a>, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates the landscape of the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>.

A petition was presented to UK <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Straw">Jack Straw</a> in 1998 asking for the witches to be pardoned, but it was decided that their convictions should stand. Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike. It followed the Swiss government's pardon earlier that year of <a href="Anna%20G%C3%B6ldi">Anna Göldi</a>, beheaded in 1782, thought to be the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch.

<a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a>, a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> novelist considered in his day the equal of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. "<a href="The%20Lancashire%20Witches%20%28novel%29">The Lancashire Witches</a>" is the only one of his 40 novels never to have been <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a>. The British writer <a href="Robert%20Neill%20%28British%20writer%20of%20historical%20fiction%29">Robert Neill</a> dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel "Mist over Pendle", first published in 1951. The writer and poet <a href="Blake%20Morrison">Blake Morrison</a> treated the subject in his suite of poems "Pendle Witches", published in 1996, and in 2011 poet <a href="Simon%20Armitage">Simon Armitage</a> narrated a documentary on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a>, "The Pendle Witch Child".

Events to mark the 400th anniversary of the trials in 2012 included an exhibition, "A Wonderful Discoverie: Lancashire Witches 1612–2012", at <a href="Gawthorpe%20Hall">Gawthorpe Hall</a> staged by <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Council">Lancashire County Council</a>. "The Fate of Chattox", a piece by David Lloyd-Mostyn for clarinet and piano, taking its theme from the events leading to Chattox's demise, was performed by Aquilon at the <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy%23Creative%20and%20performing%20arts">Chorlton Arts Festival</a>.

A life-size statue of Alice Nutter, by sculptor David Palmer, was unveiled in her home village, <a href="Roughlee%2C%20Lancashire">Roughlee</a>. In August, a world record for the largest group dressed as witches was set by 482 people who walked up Pendle Hill, on which the date "1612" had been installed in 400-foot-tall numbers by artist Philippe Handford using <a href="horticultural%20fleece">horticultural fleece</a>. The Bishop of Burnley, the Rt Rev <a href="John%20Goddard%20%28bishop%29">John Goddard</a>, expressed concern about marking the anniversary on the side of the hill.

Publications in 2012 inspired by the trials include two novellas, "The Daylight Gate" by <a href="Jeanette%20Winterson">Jeanette Winterson</a> and "Malkin Child" by <a href="Livi%20Michael">Livi Michael</a>. <a href="Blake%20Morrison">Blake Morrison</a> published a volume of poetry, "A Discoverie of Witches".

The Irish ancestry of Anna Patterson's husband Tom Costello sparked the name "Cuil", which the company states is taken from a <a href="Fenian%20Cycle">series of Celtic folklore stories</a> involving a character, <a href="Fionn%20mac%20Cumhaill">Fionn mac Cumhaill</a>, they erroneously refer to as Finn MacCuil. The company says that "Cuil" is <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> for "knowledge" and "<a href="hazel">hazel</a>".

Some linguists are unsure of this derivation and pronunciation, and note that the modern Irish word for "hazel" is spelled "<a href="Coll%20%28letter%29">coll</a>" ("coill" or "cuill" in genitive form, the former spelling having superseded the latter as a result of the "<a href="Gaeilge%23An%20Caighde%C3%A1n%20Oifigi%C3%BAil">Caighdeán Oifigiúil</a>" reforms of the mid-twentieth century). <a href="Foras%20na%20Gaeilge">Foras na Gaeilge</a>, the official governing body of the Irish language, did not support the assertion that 'cuil' means 'knowledge'. "I am unaware myself of the meaning 'knowledge' being with the word 'cuil' in Irish," Stiofán Ó Deoráin, an official on Foras na Gaeilge's terminology committee, said. Even pre-Caighdeán dictionaries such as Dineen do not associate the "cuil" spelling with knowledge or hazel. Dinneen only lists two nouns and one adjective with the spelling "cuil": ""f.", a fly, a horse-fly...", ""f.", a venomous aspect; great eagerness..." and ""gs." of col, as "a.", wicked."

The company name had previously been spelled "Cuill".

Cuil received widely critical press coverage. Concerns were expressed about the website's slow response times, irrelevant or wrong search results and in at least one case, inappropriately pornographic images displayed alongside search results. <a href="Danny%20Sullivan%20%28technologist%29">Danny Sullivan</a> of <a href="Search%20Engine%20Watch">Search Engine Watch</a> questioned the validity of Cuil's claim that it had the world's largest search engine index and criticized it for focusing on size rather than <a href="Relevance%20%28information%20retrieval%29">relevance</a>. However, despite reported problems with search results, Net Applications reported that for the last three days of July 2008, Cuil beat Google and Yahoo in the amount of time spent on a site after referral from a search engine.

According to an interview with a Cuil representative, while other <a href="Web%202.0">Web 2.0</a> launches using <a href="massively%20parallel%20%28computing%29">massively parallel processing</a> might fail with a slow down or crash, Cuil's architecture was responding with incomplete, "less-than-relevant results that then appear at the top of users' pages." Cuil's VP of communications Vince Sollitto said the search engine was experiencing heavy first-day overloads and they were "busy putting out fires." Sollitto said Cuil "will only improve with time. It's day one. Traffic is massive. We're new. There are bugs to fix, results to improve."

After the initial critical press coverage, Cuil was alleged to have caused issues for some websites, owing to how the Cuil <a href="web%20crawler">indexing robot</a> polled certain sites (including under its pre-release name, "Cuill"). Many website owners reported that the Twiceler crawler repeatedly hit their site with randomly generated URLs in an attempt to find pages inaccessible by links. Others reported irrelevant images associated with their listing in Cuil's search results.

The web crawls from Cuil were donated to the <a href="Internet%20Archive">Internet Archive</a> where they were converted into <a href="http%3A//crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual/arcs.html">arc files</a>, which are available for download at https://archive.org/details/cuilcrawl.

Rodent

Rodents (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Rodere", "to gnaw") are <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s of the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing <a href="incisors">incisors</a> in each of the upper and lower <a href="jaw">jaw</a>s. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents (2,277 species); they are found in vast numbers on all continents except <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, including human-made environments.

Species can be <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>, <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a> (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include <a href="Mouse">mice</a>, <a href="rat">rat</a>s, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, <a href="prairie%20dog">prairie dog</a>s, <a href="chipmunk">chipmunk</a>s, <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a>s, <a href="beaver">beaver</a>s, <a href="guinea%20pig">guinea pig</a>s, <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s, <a href="gerbil">gerbil</a>s and <a href="capybara">capybara</a>s. Other animals such as <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, and <a href="pika">pika</a>s, whose incisors also grow continually, were once included with them, but are now considered to be in a separate order, the <a href="Lagomorpha">Lagomorpha</a>. Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>s, sharing a <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> and forming the <a href="clade">clade</a> of <a href="Glires">Glires</a>.

Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from <a href="monogamous%20pairing%20in%20animals">monogamy</a>, to <a href="polygyny%20in%20nature">polygyny</a>, to <a href="promiscuity">promiscuity</a>. Many have <a href="Litter%20%28animal%29">litters</a> of underdeveloped, <a href="altricial">altricial</a> young, while others are <a href="precocial">precocial</a> (relatively well developed) at birth.

The rodent <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record dates back to the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> on the supercontinent of <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>. Rodents greatly diversified in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, as they spread across continents, sometimes even <a href="oceanic%20dispersal">crossing oceans</a>. Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa and were the only terrestrial <a href="placenta">placenta</a>l mammals to reach and colonize Australia.

Rodents have been used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as <a href="model%20organism">laboratory animals</a> in research. Some species, in particular, the <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>, the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>, and the <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a>, are serious <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> of rodents are often considered to be <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a> and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.

The distinguishing feature of the rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp, open-rooted <a href="Tooth%23Rodents">incisors</a>. These incisors have thick layers of enamel on the front and little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a <a href="chisel">chisel</a>. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s. A gap, or <a href="diastema">diastema</a>, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.

In many species, the molars are relatively large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups differ in the arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The <a href="Sciuromorpha">Sciuromorpha</a>, such as the <a href="eastern%20grey%20squirrel">eastern grey squirrel</a>, have a large deep <a href="masseter">masseter</a>, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The <a href="Myomorpha">Myomorpha</a>, such as the brown rat, have enlarged <a href="temporalis">temporalis</a> muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The <a href="Hystricomorpha">Hystricomorpha</a>, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The <a href="cheek%20pouch">cheek pouch</a> is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth to the front of the shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.

While the largest species, the <a href="capybara">capybara</a>, can weigh as much as , most rodents weigh less than . The smallest rodent is the <a href="Baluchistan%20pygmy%20jerboa">Baluchistan pygmy jerboa</a>, which averages only in head and body length, with adult females weighing only . Rodents have wide-ranging morphologies, but typically have squat bodies and short limbs. The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the forearms great flexibility. The majority of species are <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a>, walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails. Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> walking, running, burrowing, climbing, <a href="biped">biped</a>al hopping (<a href="kangaroo%20rat">kangaroo rat</a>s and <a href="hopping%20mice">hopping mice</a>), swimming and even gliding.
<a href="Anomalure">Scaly-tailed squirrels</a> and <a href="flying%20squirrel">flying squirrel</a>s, although not closely related, can both glide from tree to tree using <a href="patagium">parachute-like membranes</a> that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The <a href="Common%20agouti">agouti</a> is fleet-footed and <a href="antelope">antelope</a>-like, being <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a> and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are <a href="prehensile">prehensile</a>, as in the <a href="Eurasian%20harvest%20mouse">Eurasian harvest mouse</a>, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.
Rodents generally have well-developed senses of <a href="olfaction">smell</a>, hearing, and vision. Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. Many species have long, sensitive <a href="whiskers">whiskers</a> or vibrissae for touch or <a href="Whisking%20in%20animals">"whisking"</a>. Some rodents have <a href="cheek%20pouches">cheek pouches</a>, which may be lined with fur. These can be turned inside out for cleaning. In many species, the tongue cannot reach past the incisors. Rodents have efficient digestive systems, absorbing nearly 80% of ingested energy. When eating <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the <a href="cecum">cecum</a>, where bacteria reduce it to its <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> elements. The rodent then practices <a href="Coprophagia">coprophagy</a>, eating its own fecal pellets, so the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut. Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet. In many species, the penis contains a bone, the <a href="baculum">baculum</a>; the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin.

<a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexual dimorphism</a> occurs in many rodent species. In some rodents, males are larger than females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s, kangaroo rats, solitary <a href="mole%20rat">mole rat</a>s and <a href="pocket%20gopher">pocket gopher</a>s; it likely developed due to <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among <a href="chipmunk">chipmunk</a>s and <a href="Zapodinae">jumping mice</a>. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, but in the case of <a href="yellow-pine%20chipmunk">yellow-pine chipmunk</a>s, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as <a href="vole">vole</a>s, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In <a href="bank%20vole">bank vole</a>s, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.

One of the most widespread groups of mammals, rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the <a href="Polynesian%20rat">Polynesian rat</a>). Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold <a href="tundra">tundra</a> (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.

Some species such as <a href="tree%20squirrel">tree squirrel</a>s and <a href="New%20World%20porcupine">New World porcupine</a>s are <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a>, while some, such as <a href="gopher">gopher</a>s, <a href="tuco-tuco">tuco-tuco</a>s, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell on the surface of the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the <a href="earless%20water%20rat">earless water rat</a> from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as <a href="Agriculture">agricultural</a> and <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a>s.
Though some species are common pests for humans, rodents also play important ecological roles. Some rodents are considered <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> and <a href="ecosystem%20engineer">ecosystem engineer</a>s in their respective habitats. In the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> of North America, the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil <a href="aeration">aeration</a> and nutrient redistribution, raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water. They maintain these grassland habitats, and some large herbivores such as <a href="bison">bison</a> and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a> prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage.

Extirpation of prairie dogs can also contribute to regional and local <a href="biodiversity%20loss">biodiversity loss</a>, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of <a href="fungi">fungi</a> and spread <a href="spore">spore</a>s through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form <a href="mycorrhiza">symbiotic relationship</a>s with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests.

In many temperate regions, beavers play an essential <a href="hydrological">hydrological</a> role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers and allow for the creation of extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent increase in the number of <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous plant</a> species in <a href="riparian%20area">riparian area</a>s. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.

Most rodents are <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> and a few are predators. The <a href="field%20vole">field vole</a> is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The <a href="plains%20pocket%20gopher">plains pocket gopher</a> eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and <a href="Hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">cache</a>s them in underground larder chambers.

The <a href="Texas%20pocket%20gopher">Texas pocket gopher</a> avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The <a href="African%20pouched%20rat">African pouched rat</a> forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.

<a href="Agouti">Agouti</a> species are one of the few animal groups that can break open the large capsules of the <a href="Brazil%20nut">Brazil nut</a> fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.

A strategy for dealing with seasonal plenty is to eat as much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat. <a href="Marmot">Marmot</a>s do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.

Although rodents have been regarded traditionally as herbivores, a number of species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and a few members of the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American <a href="white-footed%20mouse">white-footed mouse</a>, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.

More specialized carnivores include the <a href="shrewlike%20rat">shrewlike rat</a>s of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian <a href="Rakali">water rat</a>, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The <a href="Onychomys%20leucogaster">grasshopper mouse</a> from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, and other small mice, and only a small part of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself.

Rodents exhibit a wide range of types of social behavior ranging from the mammalian <a href="Eusociality">caste system</a> of the <a href="naked%20mole-rat">naked mole-rat</a>, the extensive "town" of the colonial <a href="prairie%20dog">prairie dog</a>, through family groups to the independent, solitary life of the <a href="edible%20dormouse">edible dormouse</a>. Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in individual nests and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The <a href="pocket%20gopher">pocket gopher</a> is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory.

Larger rodents tend to live in family units where parents and their offspring live together until the young disperse. <a href="Beaver">Beaver</a>s live in extended family units typically with a pair of adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The <a href="prairie%20vole">prairie vole</a> is <a href="monogamous%20pairing%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.

Among the most social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which typically form <a href="Colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a> based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The <a href="black-tailed%20prairie%20dog">black-tailed prairie dog</a> forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.

Perhaps the most extreme examples of colonial behavior in rodents are the <a href="Eusociality">eusocial</a> naked mole rat and <a href="Damaraland%20mole%20rat">Damaraland mole rat</a>. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, while the rest of the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.

Rodents use scent marking in many social contexts including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails and the establishment of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the <a href="major%20histocompatibility%20complex">major histocompatibility complex</a> (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.

Rodents are able to recognize close relatives by smell and this allows them to show <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This <a href="kin%20recognition">kin recognition</a> is by <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile <a href="major%20urinary%20proteins">major urinary proteins</a> (MUPs), which function as <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a> transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus") excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.

House mice deposit urine, which contains pheromones, for territorial marking, individual and group recognition, and social organization Territorial beavers and <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>s investigate and become familiar with the scents of their neighbors and respond less aggressively to intrusions by them than to those made by non-territorial "floaters" or strangers. This is known as the "<a href="dear%20enemy%20effect">dear enemy effect</a>".

Many rodent species, particularly those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>s or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.

Social rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen different call-types have been recognized in adult <a href="Fukomys">Kataba mole rats</a> and four in juveniles. Similarly, the <a href="common%20degu">common degu</a>, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between <a href="Dormouse">dormice</a> and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other.

House mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.

<a href="Laboratory%20rat">Laboratory rat</a>s (which are brown rats, "Rattus norvegicus") emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine doses of <a href="morphine">morphine</a>, during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct "chirping", has been likened to <a href="laughter">laughter</a>, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so <a href="bat%20detector">bat detector</a>s have been used for this purpose.

Rodents, like all placental mammals except primates, have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina, a short wavelength "blue-UV" type and a middle wavelength "green" type. They are therefore classified as <a href="Dichromacy">dichromats</a>; however, they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not. The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear. In <a href="Common%20degu">degu</a>s, for example, the belly reflects more UV light than the back. Therefore, when a degu stands up on its hind legs, which it does when alarmed, it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm. When it stands on all fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators. Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night. There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours. Many rodents are active during twilight hours (crepuscular activity), and UV-sensitivity would be advantageous at these times. Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents.

The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) strongly reflects UV light and this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the <a href="common%20kestrel">common kestrel</a> can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.

Vibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviors being performed, predator warning and avoidance, herd or group maintenance, and courtship. The <a href="Middle%20East%20blind%20mole%20rat">Middle East blind mole rat</a> was the first mammal for which <a href="seismic%20communication">seismic communication</a> was documented. These <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a> rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels. This behavior was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behavior, but it was eventually realized that they generate temporally patterned seismic signals for long-distance communication with neighboring mole rats.

Footdrumming is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of <a href="ground%20vibrations">ground vibrations</a> as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the <a href="Cape%20mole%20rat">Cape mole rat</a>. Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.

Some species of rodent are monogamous, with an adult male and female forming a lasting <a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a>. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival. This occurs in species such as <a href="California%20mouse">California mice</a>, <a href="Oldfield%20mouse">oldfield mice</a>, <a href="Malagasy%20giant%20rat">Malagasy giant rat</a>s and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.

In <a href="polygyny%20in%20nature">polygynous</a> species, males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>s, <a href="California%20ground%20squirrel">California ground squirrel</a>s, <a href="Columbian%20ground%20squirrel">Columbian ground squirrel</a>s and <a href="Richardson%27s%20ground%20squirrel">Richardson's ground squirrel</a>s. Males with territories are known as "resident" males and the females that live within the territories are known as "resident" females. In the case of marmots, resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like <a href="Belding%27s%20ground%20squirrel">Belding's ground squirrel</a>s and some tree squirrel species.

<a href="Promiscuity">Promiscuity</a>, in which both males and females mate with multiple partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a> and males tend to have larger testicles. In the <a href="Cape%20ground%20squirrel">Cape ground squirrel</a>, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.

Female rodents play an active role in choosing their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.

In most rodent species, such as brown rats and house mice, <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a> occurs on a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is <a href="Induced%20ovulation%20%28animals%29">induced by mating</a>. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a <a href="mating%20plug">mating plug</a> in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours.

Rodents may be born either <a href="altricial">altricial</a> (blind, hairless and relatively underdeveloped) or <a href="precocial">precocial</a> (mostly furred, eyes open and fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are <a href="weaning">weaned</a>. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.

In precocial species, the mothers invest little in nest building and some do not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time in the nest than those with larger litters.
Mother rodents provide both direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, retrieving and huddling, and indirect parenting, such as food caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as <a href="alloparenting">alloparenting</a> or <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeding</a>. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the <a href="Patagonian%20mara">Patagonian mara</a>, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.

<a href="Infanticide%20in%20rodents">Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species</a> and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in <a href="primate">primate</a>s and <a href="lion">lion</a>s but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional <a href="cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">cannibalism</a> of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. <a href="Feticide">Feticide</a> can also occur among rodents; in <a href="Alpine%20marmot">Alpine marmot</a>s, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.

Rodents have advanced <a href="Animal%20cognition">cognitive</a> abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, which makes them difficult pests to deal with. Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food. Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by <a href="spatial%20memory">spatial memory</a>, rather than just by smell.

Because laboratory mice (house mice) and rats (brown rats) are widely used as <a href="model%20organism">scientific models</a> to further our understanding of biology, a great deal has come to be known about their cognitive capacities. Brown rats exhibit <a href="cognitive%20bias">cognitive bias</a>, where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state. For example, laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward, and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock, are more likely to respond to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled (something they enjoy), indicating "a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model."

Laboratory (brown) rats may have the capacity for <a href="metacognition">metacognition</a>—to consider their own learning and then make decisions based on what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates known to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple <a href="operant%20conditioning">operant conditioning</a> principles, or a <a href="Behavioral%20economics">behavioral economic</a> model. Brown rats use social learning in a wide range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences.

Dentition is the key feature by which <a href="fossil">fossil</a> rodents are recognized and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of <a href="Glires">Glires</a>, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then <a href="evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a> during the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>. Some <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a> data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record.

Rodents are thought to have evolved in Asia, where local <a href="Multituberculata">multituberculate</a> faunas were severely affected by the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a> and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were able to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.

The history of the colonization of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The movements of the large superfamily <a href="Muroidea">Muroidea</a> (including <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s, <a href="gerbil">gerbil</a>s, true <a href="mouse">mice</a> and <a href="rat">rat</a>s) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia.

During the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, rodents began to diversify. Beavers appeared in Eurasia in the late Eocene before spreading to North America in the late Miocene. Late in the Eocene, <a href="hystricognath">hystricognath</a>s invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (<a href="caviomorph">caviomorph</a>s) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to <a href="oceanic%20dispersal">cross the Atlantic on floating debris</a>. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least as early as this for hystricognaths in Africa), and had <a href="List%20of%20rodents%20of%20the%20Caribbean">reached the Greater Antilles</a> by the early <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.

<a href="Nesomyidae">Nesomyid</a> rodents are thought to have rafted from Africa to Madagascar 20–24 million years ago. All 27 species of native appear to be descendents of a single colonization event.

By 20 million years ago, fossils recognizably belonging to the current families such as Muridae had emerged. By the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a> began to spread into <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, "<a href="Castoroides">Castoroides ohioensis</a>", which grew to a length of and weight of . The largest known rodent was "<a href="Josephoartigasia%20monesi">Josephoartigasia monesi</a>", a <a href="pacarana">pacarana</a> with an estimated body length of 3 m (10 ft).

The first rodents arrived in Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago. Although <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s are the most prominent mammals in Australia, many <a href="List%20of%20rodents%20of%20Australia">rodents</a>, all belonging to the subfamily <a href="Murinae">Murinae</a>, are among the <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Australia">continent's mammal species</a>. There are about fifty species of 'old endemics', the first wave of rodents to colonize the country in the Miocene and early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, and eight true rat ("<a href="Rattus">Rattus</a>") species of 'new endemics', arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. The earliest fossil rodents in Australia have a maximum age of 4.5 million years, and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification. A further wave of <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a> occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later.

Rodents participated in the <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">Great American Interchange</a> that resulted from the joining of the Americas by formation of the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>, around 3 million years ago in the <a href="Piacenzian">Piacenzian</a> age. In this exchange, a such as the New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) headed north. However, the main southward invasion of <a href="Sigmodontinae">sigmodontines</a> preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years, probably occurring via rafting. Sigmodontines diversified explosively once in South America, although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization. Their "head start" has relegated other North American rodent groups (sciurids, geomyids, heteromyids and nonsigmodontine cricetids) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna.
The use of the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> name "Rodentia" is attributed to the English traveler and naturalist <a href="Thomas%20Edward%20Bowdich">Thomas Edward Bowdich</a> (1821). The <a href="New%20Latin">Modern Latin</a> word "Rodentia" is derived from "rodens", present participle of "rodere" – "to gnaw", "eat away". The <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s and <a href="pika">pika</a>s (order Lagomorpha) have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order. However, they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories. The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the <a href="clade">clade</a>s Glires, <a href="Euarchontoglires">Euarchontoglires</a> and <a href="Boreoeutheria">Boreoeutheria</a>. The cladogram below shows the inner and outer relations of Rodentia based on a 2012 attempt by Wu et al. to align the molecular clock with paleontological data:

The living rodent families based on the study done by Fabre et al. 2012.

The order Rodentia may be divided into <a href="suborder">suborder</a>s, <a href="infraorder">infraorder</a>s, <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">superfamilies</a> and <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>. There is a great deal of <a href="Parallel%20evolution">parallelism</a> and <a href="Convergent%20evolution">convergence</a> among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Brandt</a> (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a <a href="Phylogeny">phylogenetic tree</a> of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.

These disagreements remain unresolved, nor have <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular studies</a> fully resolved the situation though they have confirmed the <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> of the group and that the clade has descended from a common Paleocene ancestor. Carleton and Musser (2005) in "Mammal Species of the World" have provisionally adopted a five suborder system: Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha, and Hystricomorpha. These include 33 families, 481 genera and 2277 species.

Order Rodentia (from Latin, "rodere", to gnaw)


While rodents are not the most seriously threatened order of mammals, there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention in the face of limited appreciation by the public. Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots. Several species of <a href="Oryzomys">rice rat</a> have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species. In Colombia, the <a href="brown%20hairy%20dwarf%20porcupine">brown hairy dwarf porcupine</a> was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the <a href="Santamartamys">red crested soft-furred spiny rat</a> is known only from its <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable. The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes "We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened, mainly by environmental disturbance and intensive hunting".

The "three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species" (the brown rat, the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the <a href="Age%20of%20Exploration">Age of Exploration</a>, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat ("Rattus exulans"), have severely damaged island <a href="Biota%20%28ecology%29">biota</a>s around the world. For example, when the black rat reached <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a> in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the <a href="Lord%20Howe%20fantail">Lord Howe fantail</a>, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a> (1943) and <a href="Big%20South%20Cape%20Island">Big South Cape Island</a> (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> rodenticide such as <a href="brodifacoum">brodifacoum</a>. This approach has been successful on the island of <a href="Lundy">Lundy</a> in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a> and <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a> a chance to recover from near-extinction.

Humanity has long used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the <a href="fur">fur</a> provides extra insulation. The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them together to make robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">North American fur trade</a> developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as "beaver wool" was found to be ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. Later, the <a href="coypu">coypu</a> took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. The <a href="chinchilla">chinchilla</a> has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> <a href="Roach%20%28headdress%29">"porky roach"</a> headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a> women would harvest the quills for <a href="quillwork">quillwork</a> by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.

At least 89 species of rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, there were at least 42 different societies in which people eat rats. Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca Empire</a>. Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called "gliraria", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns. The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take.

Guinea pigs are used in the cuisine of <a href="Cuzco">Cuzco</a>, Peru, in dishes such as "cuy al horno", baked guinea pig. The traditional Andean stove, known as a "qoncha" or a "fogón", is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo people</a> ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the <a href="Southern%20Paiute">Paiute</a> ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.

Rodents are used widely as <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s in animal testing. Albino mutant <a href="Laboratory%20rat">rats</a> were first used for research in 1828 and later became the first animal <a href="Domestication">domesticated</a> for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is the most commonly used laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental biology</a>, <a href="cell%20biology">cell biology</a>, <a href="oncology">oncology</a> and <a href="immunology">immunology</a>. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory</a> in the late 19th century, through the experiments of <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Paul%20%C3%89mile%20Roux">Émile Roux</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a>. They have been <a href="animals%20in%20space">launched into orbital space flight</a> several times—first by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a> on the <a href="Sputnik%209">Sputnik 9</a> <a href="biosatellite">biosatellite</a> of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is <a href="poikilothermic">poikilothermic</a>; it is used in studies on <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter <a href="substance%20P">substance P</a>, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on <a href="pain">pain</a>.

Rodents have sensitive olfactory abilities, which have been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The <a href="Gambian%20pouched%20rat">Gambian pouched rat</a> is able to detect <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>s. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.

Rodents including guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets able to live in small spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.

Some rodent species are serious agricultural <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>, eating large quantities of food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of <a href="rice">rice</a> lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated to be enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by a relatively small number of species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including "<a href="Mastomys">Mastomys</a>" and "<a href="Arvicanthis">Arvicanthis</a>" damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as "<a href="Microtus">Microtus brandti</a>", "<a href="Meriones%20unguiculatus">Meriones unguiculatus</a>" and "<a href="Eospalax">Eospalax baileyi</a>" damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of "<a href="Apodemus">Apodemus</a>", "Microtus" and in occasional outbreaks "<a href="Arvicola%20terrestris">Arvicola terrestris</a>" cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>", "<a href="Akodon">Akodon</a>", "<a href="Calomys">Calomys</a>", "<a href="Oligoryzomys">Oligoryzomys</a>", "<a href="Phyllotis">Phyllotis</a>", "<a href="Sigmodon">Sigmodon</a>" and "<a href="Zygodontomys">Zygodontomys</a>", damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.

Rodents are also significant vectors of disease. The black rat, with the <a href="Northern%20rat%20flea">fleas that it carries</a>, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>" responsible for <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>, and carries the organisms responsible for <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, <a href="Weil%27s%20disease">Weil's disease</a>, <a href="toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a> and <a href="trichinosis">trichinosis</a>. A number of rodents carry <a href="hantavirus">hantavirus</a>es, including the <a href="Puumala%20virus">Puumala</a>, <a href="Dobrava%20virus">Dobrava</a> and <a href="Saaremaa%20virus">Saaremaa virus</a>es, which can infect humans. Rodents also help to transmit diseases including <a href="babesiosis">babesiosis</a>, cutaneous <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a>, <a href="human%20granulocytic%20anaplasmosis">human granulocytic anaplasmosis</a>, <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a>, <a href="Omsk%20hemorrhagic%20fever">Omsk hemorrhagic fever</a>, <a href="Powassan%20virus">Powassan virus</a>, <a href="rickettsialpox">rickettsialpox</a>, <a href="relapsing%20fever">relapsing fever</a>, <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20spotted%20fever">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a>, and <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a>.

Because rodents are a nuisance and endanger <a href="public%20health">public health</a>, human societies often attempt to control them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, <a href="integrated%20pest%20management">integrated pest management</a> attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and <a href="biological%20control">biological control</a> using <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s or <a href="predator">predator</a>s, as well as <a href="Rodenticide">poisoning</a> and trapping. The use of pathogens such as "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including <a href="ferret">ferret</a>s, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s and <a href="monitor%20lizard">monitor lizard</a>s has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral <a href="cat">cat</a>s are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.

Iraq War in Anbar Province

The Iraq War in Anbar Province, also known as the Al Anbar campaign, consisted of fighting between the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States military</a>, together with <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20Iraq">Iraqi Government</a> forces, and <a href="Iraqi%20insurgency%20%28Iraq%20War%29">Sunni insurgents</a> in the western <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i province of <a href="Anbar%20Province">Al Anbar</a>. The <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and <a href="counter-insurgency">counterinsurgency</a> campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy <a href="urban%20warfare">urban warfare</a> primarily between insurgents and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a>, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with <a href="improvised%20explosive%20device">improvised explosive device</a>s (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the <a href="Sunni%20Triangle">Sunni Triangle</a> around the cities of <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a> and <a href="Ramadi">Ramadi</a>.

Al Anbar, the only <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a>-dominated province in Iraq, saw little fighting in the initial <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion</a>. Following the fall of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> it was occupied by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>'s <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">82nd Airborne Division</a>. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis <a href="Fallujah%20killings%20of%20April%202003">were killed in Fallujah</a> by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi by the end of 2004, including the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Fallujah">Second Battle of Fallujah</a>. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates River</a> Valley. During this time, <a href="Al-Qaeda%20in%20Iraq">Al Qaeda in Iraq</a> (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramadi%20%282006%29%23The%20Devlin%20report">an intelligence report</a> in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.

In August 2006, several tribes located in Ramadi and led by <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a> <a href="Abdul%20Sattar%20Abu%20Risha">Abdul Sattar Abu Risha</a> began to form what would eventually become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The <a href="Sons%20of%20Iraq">Anbar Awakening</a> helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, as well as other cities such as <a href="H%C4%ABt">Hīt</a>, <a href="Haditha">Haditha</a>, and <a href="Ar%20Rutba">Rutbah</a>. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, due largely to its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural entry points for foreign fighters to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities of Fallujah and <a href="Al-Karmah">Al-Karmah</a>.

The fighting was mostly over by September 2007, although US forces maintained a stabilizing and advisory role through December 2011. Celebrating the victory, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> flew to Anbar in September 2007 to congratulate Sheikh Sattar and other leading tribal figures. AQI assassinated Sattar days later. In September 2008, <a href="Provincial%20Iraqi%20Control">political control</a> was transferred to Iraq. Military control was transferred in June 2009, following the withdrawal of American combat forces from <a href="Anbar%20Province%23List%20of%20cities%20and%20towns%20in%20Al-Anbar">the cities</a>. The Marines were replaced by the US Army in January 2010. The Army withdrew its combat units by August 2010, leaving only advisory and support units. The last American forces left the province on 7 December 2011.

Al Anbar is Iraq's largest and westernmost province. It comprises 32 percent of the country's total land mass, nearly , almost exactly the size of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> in the United States and slightly larger than Greece. Geographically, it is isolated from most of Iraq, but is easy to access from <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Jordan, and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. The <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates River</a>, <a href="Lake%20Habbaniyah">Lake Habbaniyah</a>, and the artificially created <a href="Lake%20Qadisiyah">Lake Qadisiyah</a> are its most significant geographical features. Outside of the Euphrates area the terrain is overwhelmingly desert, comprising the eastern part of the <a href="Syrian%20Desert">Syrian Desert</a>. Temperatures range from highs of in July and August to below from November to March. The province lacks significant natural resources and many inhabitants benefited from the Ba'athist government's <a href="patronage">patronage</a> system, funded by oil revenues from elsewhere in the country.

The <a href="Coalition%20Provisional%20Authority">Coalition Provisional Authority</a> (CPA) estimated that about 1.2 million Iraqis lived in Anbar in 2003, more than two-thirds of them in <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a> and <a href="Ramadi">Ramadi</a>. With a population 95 percent Sunni, many from the <a href="Dulaim">Dulaimi Tribe</a>, Anbar is Iraq's only province without a significant <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> or <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurdish</a> population. 95 percent of the population lives within of the Euphrates. At the time of the invasion, Fallujah was known as a religious enclave hostile towards outsiders, while Ramadi, the provincial capital, was more secular. Outside the cities, the ancient <a href="Arab%20tribes%20in%20Iraq">tribal system</a> run by <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a>s held considerable influence.
Conditions in Anbar particularly favored an insurgency. The province was overwhelmingly Sunni, the minority religious group that lost its power and influence in post-<a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> Iraq. Hussein was also very popular in the province than anywhere else in the country. Many did not fight during the invasion (allowing them to claim that they had not been defeated) and "still wanted to slug it out", according to journalist <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Ricks%20%28journalist%29">Tom Ricks</a>. Military service was compulsory in Saddam's Iraq and the <a href="Amiriyah%20Fallujah">Amiriyah</a> area contained a sizeable portion of Iraq's arms industry. Immediately after Saddam fell, insurgents and others looted many of the 96 known munitions sites, as well as local armories and weapons stockpiles. These weapons were used to arm the insurgents in Anbar and elsewhere. While only a small minority of Sunnis were initially insurgents, many either supported or tolerated them. Sympathetic Ba'athists and former Saddam officials in Syrian exile provided money, sanctuary, and foreign fighters to insurgent groups. Future <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20Iraq">al-Qaeda in Iraq</a> leader <a href="Abu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> spent part of 2002 in central Iraq, including Anbar Province, preparing for resistance. Within several months of the invasion the province had become a sanctuary for anti-occupation fighters.

Anbar experienced relatively little fighting during the initial <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>, as the main US offensive was directed through the Shia areas of southeastern Iraq, from Kuwait to Baghdad. An infantry division had been earmarked in 2002 to secure Anbar during the invasion. However, <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> decided to treat the province with an "economy of force" in early 2003. The first <a href="Coalition%20Forces%20Land%20Component%20Command">Coalition forces</a> to enter Al Anbar were American and Australian <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>, who seized vital targets such as <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a> and Haditha Dam and prevented the launch of <a href="Scud">Scud missiles</a> at <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. While there was generally little combat, the most significant engagement occurred when elements of the American <a href="3rd%20Ranger%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Battalion</a> <a href="75th%20Ranger%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">75th Ranger Regiment</a> seized <a href="Haditha%20Dam">Haditha Dam</a> on 31 March 2003. Surrounded by a larger Iraqi force, the Rangers held the dam until relieved after eight days. During the siege, they destroyed twenty-nine Iraqi tanks and killed an estimated 300 to 400 Iraqi soldiers. Three Rangers were awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for the action. In addition, four other Rangers were killed when their checkpoint near Haditha was attacked by a <a href="Suicide%20attack">suicide bomber</a>.

At the end of the invasion, the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar–the <a href="Arab%20Socialist%20Ba%27ath%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Iraq%20Region">Ba'ath Party</a>, the <a href="Republican%20Guard%20%28Iraq%29">Republican Guard</a>, the <a href="Fedayeen%20Saddam">Fedayeen Saddam</a>, and the <a href="Iraqi%20Intelligence%20Service">Iraqi Intelligence Service</a>–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to relocate from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq%23Security%2C%20looting%20and%20war%20damage">looting</a> throughout Baghdad and other parts of the country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Infantry Division</a> at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.

Shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baghdad%20%282003%29">Fall of Baghdad</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> turned Anbar Province over to a single regiment, the <a href="3d%20Armored%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29%23First%20Tour%20%28OIF%29">3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment</a> (ACR). With only several thousand soldiers, that force had little hope of effectively controlling Anbar.

The immediate catalyst for violent activity in the Fallujah area came after what many Iraqis and foreign journalists dubbed a <a href="Fallujah%20killings%20of%20April%202003">"massacre" in Fallujah</a>. On the evening of 28 April 2003, Saddam Hussein's birthday, a crowd of about one hundred men, women, and children staged anti-American protests outside US military outposts in Fallujah. The Iraqis claimed they were unarmed, while the Army said that some individuals were carrying and firing <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a>s. The soldiers manning one of the outposts fired on the crowd, killing at least twelve and wounding dozens more. The Army never apologized for the killings or paid compensation. In the weeks afterwards, the town's pro-US mayor urged the Americans to leave.

On 16 May 2003, the CPA issued Order Number 1, which abolished the Ba'ath Party and began a process of "<a href="de-Ba%27athification">de-Ba'athification</a>", and on 23 May 2003 issued <a href="Coalition%20Provisional%20Authority%20Order%20Number%202">Order Number 2</a>, which disbanded the Iraqi Army and other security services. Both orders further antagonized the Sunnis of Anbar. Many Sunnis took great pride in the Iraqi Army and viewed its disbanding as an act of contempt towards the Iraqi people. The dissolution also put hundreds of thousands of Anbaris out of work as many were members of the Army or the party. Three days after CPA Order No. 2, Major Matthew Schram became the first American killed since the invasion in Anbar Province when his convoy came under <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a> (RPG) attack on 26 May near Haditha.

Following the disbanding of the Iraqi Army, insurgent activity increased, especially in Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could be characterized as either Sunni nationalists who wanted to bring back the Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the <a href="U.S.%20list%20of%20most-wanted%20Iraqis">US list of most-wanted Iraqis</a>. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.

In June, American forces conducted <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Scorpion%20%28Iraq%202003%29">Operation Desert Scorpion</a>, a mostly unsuccessful attempt to root out the burgeoning insurgency. An isolated success occurred near <a href="Rawa%20%28Iraq%29">Rawah</a>, where American soldiers cornered and killed more than 70 fighters on 12 June and captured a large weapons cache.

In general, American forces had difficulty distinguishing between Iraqi civilians and insurgents, and the civilian casualties incurred during the sweep increased support for the insurgency. On 5 July, a bomb killed seven at a graduation ceremony for the first American-trained police cadets in Ramadi. On 16 July, Mohammed Nayil Jurayfi, the pro-government mayor of <a href="Haditha">Haditha</a>, and his youngest son were assassinated.
As the violence escalated, the US responded with what many Iraqis called the "senseless use of firepower" and "midnight raids on innocent men". <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> accused the Army of a pattern of "over-aggressive tactics, indiscriminate shooting in residential areas and a quick reliance on lethal force", as well as using "disproportionate force". For example, if Iraqi insurgents set off a <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>, the US would respond by dropping <a href="bomb">bomb</a>s on those houses with arms caches; when insurgents fired a mortar round at American positions near Fallujah, the Americans responded with <a href="artillery">heavy artillery</a>. American forces near Al Qaim conducted "hard knocks" on local residents, kicking in doors and manhandling individuals, only to discover they were innocent. In an incident on 11 September, soldiers manning a checkpoint near Fallujah shot multiple rounds at both an Iraqi police truck and a nearby hospital, killing seven. Soldiers also beat and abused Iraqi detainees. There was a constant rotation of units through the province, which led to confusion among the American troops: Fallujah had five different battalions rotate through in five months. Summing up the initial American approach to Al Anbar, Keith Mines, the CPA diplomat in Anbar Province, wrote:

On 31 October, during <a href="Operation%20Abalone">Operation Abalone</a> teams from A Squadron of the British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">SAS</a> supported by <a href="Delta%20force">Delta force</a> assaulted insurgent held compounds/dwellings in the fringes of Ramadi, killing an estimated dozen insurgents and capturing four, the operation turned up evidence of foreign fighters; finding actual proof of an internationalist jihadist movement. One SAS operator was killed in the operation. The SAS also operated covertly in <a href="Ramadi">Ramadi</a> and <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a> in October and November 2003 and other more remote parts of <a href="Al%20Anbar%20Governorate">Al Anbar Province</a> as part of Operation Paradoxical which was aimed at hunting down threats to the coalition.

During the insurgency's <a href="Ramadan%20Offensive">Ramadan Offensive</a>, a military <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook">Chinook transport helicopter</a> carrying 32 soldiers was shot down with an <a href="Strela%202">SA-7 missile</a> near Fallujah on 2 November. Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded. Following the shootdown, Fallujah was quiet for a few months. On 5 November, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early the next year and would take over Anbar Province. As the Marines prepared to move in, there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area, although the only real problem was Fallujah. Some Marine commanders, like Major General <a href="James%20Mattis">James Mattis</a> and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy, criticized the Army's tactics as "hard-nosed" and "humiliating the Sunni population", promising that the Marines would act differently. Late that November, Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province, after they came under fire from insurgents inside, air support was called in and hit the farm, after it was cleared; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters. Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December <a href="Operation%20Red%20Dawn">capture of Saddam Hussein</a>. The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar: instead of weakening the insurgency, many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam. Saddam's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred for Saddam. As Saddam loyalists were killed or captured, leadership positions went to AQI-affiliated hardliners such as <a href="Abdullah%20Abu%20Azzam%20al-Iraqi">Abdullah Abu Azzam al-Iraqi</a>, who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004. While the Ba'ath Party continued to play a major role in the insurgency, the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a <a href="jihad">jihad</a> against American forces.

At the beginning of 2004, General <a href="Ricardo%20Sanchez">Ricardo Sanchez</a>, head of <a href="Multi-National%20Force%20%E2%80%93%20Iraq">Multinational Force Iraq</a> (MNF–I), claimed that the US had "made significant progress in Anbar Province." However, CPA funds for the province were inadequate. A brigade commander in Fallujah was allocated only $200,000 a month, when he estimated that it would cost at least $25 million to restart the city's factories, which employed tens of thousands of workers. By February, insurgent attacks were rapidly increasing. On 12 February, <a href="United%20States%20Central%20Command">United States Central Command</a> (CENTCOM) commander General <a href="John%20Abizaid">John P. Abizaid</a> and Major General <a href="Charles%20H.%20Swannack%2C%20Jr.">Chuck Swannack</a>, the 82nd Airborne's commanding officer, were attacked while driving through Fallujah. On 14 February, in an incident dubbed the "Valentine's Day Massacre", insurgents overran a police station in downtown Fallujah, killing 23 to 25 policemen and freeing 75 prisoners. The next day, the Americans fired Fallujah's police chief for refusing to wear his uniform and arrested the mayor. In March, Keith Mines wrote, "there is not a single properly trained and equipped Iraqi security officer in the entire Al Anbar province." He added that security was entirely dependent on American soldiers, yet those same soldiers inflamed Sunni nationalists. That same month General Swannack gave a briefing on Anbar where he talked about improved security, declared the insurgency there was all but finished, and concluded "the future for Al Anbar in Iraq remains very bright."

The 82nd Airborne handed control of Anbar Province over to the <a href="I%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force">I Marine Expeditionary Force</a> (I MEF), also known as <a href="Multi-National%20Forces%20West">Multi-National Forces West</a> (MNF-W), on 24 March. Nearly two-thirds of the Marines, including their commanders <a href="James%20T.%20Conway">James T. Conway</a> and James Mattis, had participated in the invasion in 2003. Conway planned on gradually reestablishing control over Anbar Province using a methodical <a href="counterinsurgency">counterinsurgency</a> program, showing respect for the population and training the Iraqi Army and police using <a href="military%20transition%20team">military transition team</a>s (based on the <a href="Combined%20Action%20Program">Combined Action Program</a> used by the Marines during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>). During the transition of authority between the MEF and the 82nd Airborne it became obvious that western Iraq was going to be more problematic for the Marines than southern Iraq had been.

On 15 March, <a href="3rd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">3rd Battalion 7th Marines</a> operating near Al Qaim got into a firefight with Syrian border guards. On 24 March, several Marines and paratroopers were wounded in Fallujah when insurgents attacked the ceremony for transfer of authority.

Just one week after the MEF had taken over Anbar, insurgents in Fallujah <a href="2004%20Fallujah%20ambush">ambushed a convoy</a> carrying four American <a href="private%20military%20company">mercenaries</a> from <a href="Academi">Blackwater USA</a> on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 <a href="Battle%20of%20Mogadishu%20%281993%29">Battle of Mogadishu</a>, where images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.

That same day five soldiers were killed in nearby <a href="Habbaniyah">Habbaniyah</a> when their <a href="M113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier">M113 armored personnel carrier</a> was hit by a mine. According to General Conway, it was the largest mine that had been used in Anbar to date; only a tailgate and a boot were recovered.

In response to the killings, General Sanchez ordered the Marines to attack Fallujah, under direct orders from President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. General Conway and his staff initially urged caution, pointing out that the MEF had already developed a more nuanced long-term plan to reestablish control over Fallujah and that using overwhelming force would most likely further destabilize the city. They noted that the insurgents were specifically trying to "bait us into overreaction." Despite these objections, General Sanchez wanted a sustained Marine presence in the city within 72 hours.

The Marines began their attack, codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve, on 5 April. The overall ground commander in Anbar, 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis, initially planned to use his only available units, <a href="1st%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">1st Battalion 5th Marines</a> and <a href="2nd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">2nd Battalion 1st Marines</a>. They would push in from the east and west and methodically contain the insurgents. This plan was underway when on 9 April, General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt.

The main reason behind this order was the coverage by the <a href="Al%20Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> and <a href="Al%20Arabiya">Al Arabiya</a> television networks. The two networks had the only access to the city. They repeatedly reported that Marines were using excessive force and <a href="collective%20punishment">collective punishment</a>, and their footage of dead babies in hospitals inflamed both Iraqi and world opinion. General Conway later summed up their effect on the battle by saying, "Al Jazeera kicked our ass." When the 2nd Iraqi Battalion was ordered to Fallujah, 30 percent of its soldiers refused or deserted, and within days over 80 percent of the police force and Iraqi National Guard in Anbar Province had deserted. After two members of the <a href="Iraqi%20Governing%20Council">Iraqi Governing Council</a> resigned over the attack and five more threatened to do so, CPA Leader <a href="L.%20Paul%20Bremer">Paul Bremer</a> and CENTCOM commander General John Abizaid were worried that Fallujah might bring down the Iraqi government and ordered a unilateral ceasefire.
Following the ceasefire, the Marines held their positions and brought in additional units, waiting for what they assumed would be the resumption of their attack. General Mattis launched Operation Ripper Sweep while the Marines waited, pushing the <a href="1st%20Light%20Armored%20Reconnaissance%20Battalion">1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion</a> (LAR) and <a href="2nd%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 7th Marines</a> into the farmlands around Fallujah and neutralizing many armed gangs operating along the local highways. The <a href="3rd%20Battalion%204th%20Marines">3rd Battalion 4th Marines</a> also conducted a <a href="Raid%20%28military%29">raid</a> into nearby insurgent-held <a href="Al-Karmah">Karmah</a>, which expanded into a major engagement lasting the rest of the month. The Marines were able to keep their supply lines open, but withdrew for political reasons. President Bush refused to allow the resumption of the attack, but was also unhappy with the status quo, asking his commanders for "other options".

Finally, General Conway proposed what was a workable compromise in his opinion: the <a href="Fallujah%20Brigade">Fallujah Brigade</a>. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as <a href="Jasim%20Mohammed%20Saleh">Jasim Mohammed Saleh</a> and <a href="Muhammed%20Latif">Muhammed Latif</a>, and made up largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines, the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization <a href="Iraq%20Body%20Count%20project">Iraq Body Count</a> argued that 600 civilians had been killed.

Four Marines and soldiers were awarded either the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> or <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> for the battle. Another Marine, Captain <a href="Douglas%20A.%20Zembiec">Douglas A. Zembiec</a> of Echo Company 2nd Battalion 1st Marines, became known as the "Lion of Fallujah" for his actions during the assault.

Outside of Fallujah, there were additional attacks on American positions in Anbar throughout the spring and summer of 2004. They were part of a larger "jihad wave" that swept across the Province in mid-April. Gangs of armed youths took to the streets, setting up impromptu roadblocks and threatening supply routes in eastern Anbar Province and around Baghdad. At one point General Mattis feared a general uprising by the Sunni community, similar to the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution%23Muharram%20protests">1978 Tehran protests</a>.
On 6 April, a force of 300 insurgents <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramadi%20%282004%29">attacked Marine patrols throughout Ramadi</a> in an attempt to relieve pressure on Fallujah. Sixteen US Marines and an estimated 250 insurgents were killed in heavy street fighting over four days.

Nearly all members of a squad from <a href="2nd%20Battalion%204th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 4th Marines</a> were killed when they drove into an ambush in unarmored <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a>s, the first time the Marines had lost a firefight in Iraq. On 17 April, insurgents attacked a Marine patrol in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Husaybah%20%282004%29">border city of Husaybah</a>, leading to a series of engagements that lasted the whole day and resulted in five Marines and at least 120 insurgents killed. Around the same time, on 14 April, a squad led by Corporal <a href="Jason%20Dunham">Jason Dunham</a> was operating near Husaybah when one member of a group of Iraqis who were being searched by Dunham's squad threw a grenade at the squad. Dunham immediately threw himself on the grenade, receiving a mortal wound from the blast but saving his fellow squad members. He later became the first Marine since the Vietnam War to be awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>.

Attempting to emulate the perceived success in Fallujah, US commanders in Ramadi responded to the 28 June transfer of sovereignty from the CPA to the <a href="Iraqi%20Interim%20Government">Iraqi Interim Government</a> by pulling most forces back to camps outside the city and focusing on securing a highway that ran through its center. Fighting continued to escalate throughout Anbar Province. On 21 June, a four-man <a href="Scout%20Sniper">Scout Sniper</a> team operating with 2nd Battalion 4th Marines in Ramadi was executed by a group of insurgents who had infiltrated their observation post. In mid-July, General Mattis predicted that Anbar would "[go] to hell" if the Marines could not hold Ramadi. On 5 August, Anbar Provincial Governor <a href="Abd%20al-Karim%20Barjas">Abd al-Karim Barjas</a> resigned following the kidnapping of his two sons by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Barjas appeared on television and publicly apologized for "cooperation with the infidel". He was replaced by an interim governor until January 2005. The head of the Ramadi police force was subsequently arrested for complicity with the kidnappings.

That same month, an Iraqi battalion commander was captured by insurgents in Fallujah and beaten to death. After his death, two Iraqi National Guard battalions near Fallujah promptly deserted, leaving their weapons and equipment to the insurgents. Counterinsurgency expert <a href="John%20Nagl">John Nagl</a>, serving in nearby <a href="Al%20Khaldiya%2C%20Iraq">Khaldiyah</a>, said that his unit knew the local police chief was supporting the insurgency, "but assessed that he had to do so to stay alive." Suicide bombers killed seven Marines from 2nd Battalion 1st Marines on 6 September, eleven Iraqi police near <a href="Baghdadi%2C%20Iraq">Baghdadi</a> on 23 October, and eight Marines from the newly arrived <a href="1st%20Battalion%203rd%20Marines">1st Battalion 3rd Marines</a> one week later. More than 100 Americans were killed in Anbar from May 2004 to October 2004.

Prior to November, Iraqi Prime Minister <a href="Ayad%20Allawi">Ayad Allawi</a> invited representatives from Ramadi and Fallujah in an attempt to negotiate an end to the fighting, similar to his previous dealings with Shia leader <a href="Muqtada%20al-Sadr">Muqtada al-Sadr</a>. In September, with the blessings of the Americans, Allawi disbanded the discredited Fallujah Brigade and privately gave the Marines permission to begin planning an offensive to retake Fallujah. In early October, Allawi stepped up his efforts, demanding that the representatives of Fallujah hand over Zarqawi or face a renewed assault. They refused. Shortly before the Marine offensive began, Sheikh <a href="Harith%20al-Dhari">Harith al-Dhari</a>, leader of the pro-insurgent <a href="Association%20of%20Muslim%20Scholars">Association of Muslim Scholars</a>, said that "the Iraqi people view Fallujah as the symbol of their steadfastness, resistance and pride."

Despite the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June, the insurgency was still viewed by many Iraqis as legitimate and the Iraqi government as agents of the United States. In late 2004, a CIA officer said that insurgents in Ramadi were receiving financing via Syria "to the tune of $1.2 million a month". The insurgency continued to enjoy broad-based support throughout Iraqi society, showing few of the sectarian divisions which would become pronounced following the <a href="2006%20al-Askari%20Mosque%20bombing">2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing</a>. Shia Iraqis attacked Iraqi military units moving towards Fallujah, Shia leaders called on their supporters to <a href="Blood%20donation">donate blood</a> for insurgents, and Muqtada al-Sadr referred to the insurgents in Fallujah as "holy warriors". Some Shi'ia attempted to join the fighting.

The first in a series of execution videos was released on 11 May by AQI, of its leader al-Zarqawi executing American citizen <a href="Nick%20Berg">Nick Berg</a>. Many of these hostages, such as <a href="Kim%20Sun-il">Kim Sun-il</a>, <a href="Foreign%20hostages%20in%20Iraq">Eugene Armstrong</a>, <a href="Jack%20Hensley">Jack Hensley</a>, and <a href="Kenneth%20Bigley">Kenneth Bigley</a>, were taken to Zarqawi's base in Fallujah for execution.

After the initial push into Fallujah, the US argued that Zarqawi was behind a series of car bombings throughout Iraq. There had been no large car bombings in Baghdad during the siege, and enough munitions and contraband had been uncovered to conclude that many "bombs and car bombs detonated elsewhere in Iraq may have been manufactured in Fallujah." In contrast, there were 30 large car bombs in the two months following the creation of the Fallujah Brigade, and the Brigade was now seen by the US and Iraqi governments as a front for the insurgency. The suicide bombings and the hostage videos made Zarqawi the public face of the Iraqi insurgency in 2004, even though his leadership was disputed by many Sunni nationalist commanders. By late 2004 the US government's bounty on his head matched <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>'s. However, a senior US military intelligence official described the core of the insurgency in December 2004 as "the old Sunni oligarchy using religious nationalism as a motivating force."

The order by Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November, just four days after George W. Bush was <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">reelected as president</a>. <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> commander General <a href="Richard%20F.%20Natonski">Richard F. Natonski</a> assembled an ad-hoc force of six Marine battalions, three Army battalions, three Iraqi battalions, and the British <a href="Black%20Watch">Black Watch Regiment</a>. The insurgents, loosely led by Zarqawi, <a href="Abdullah%20al-Janabi">Abdullah al-Janabi</a>, and Zarqawi's lieutenant Hadid, had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3,000 and 4,000 men in the city. They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks, <a href="berm">berm</a>s, and mines, while conducting attacks outside the city to tie down Marine units.

The attack began on 7 November when General Natonski had the <a href="3rd%20Light%20Armored%20Reconnaissance%20Battalion">3rd LAR</a> and <a href="Iraqi%2036th%20Commando%20Battalion">36th</a> Iraqi battalions seize the city's hospital, located on a peninsula just west of the city. The main attack began the night of 8 November. Coalition forces attacked from the north, achieving complete tactical surprise.

The insurgents responded by attacking the Marines in small groups, often armed with RPGs. According to General Natonski, many insurgents had seen pictures of the <a href="Abu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse">Abu Ghraib scandal</a> and were determined not to be taken alive. By 20 November, Marines had reached the southern boundary of the city, but pockets of insurgents still remained. The assault battalions divided the city into areas and crisscrossed their assigned areas in an attempt to find the insurgents. Four days later Zarqawi released an audiotape condemning Sunni Muslim clerics for their lack of support, claiming "hundreds of thousands of the nation's sons are being slaughtered." The fighting slowly ebbed and by 16 December the US had begun to reopen the city and allow residents to return.
The battle was later described by the US military as "the heaviest <a href="urban%20warfare">urban combat</a> Marines have been involved in since the <a href="battle%20of%20Hue">battle of Hue City</a> in Vietnam." The official Marine Corps history recorded that 78 Marines, sailors, and soldiers died and another 651 were wounded retaking Fallujah (394 were able to return to duty). One-third of the dead and wounded came from a single battalion, <a href="3rd%20Battalion%201st%20Marines">3rd Battalion 1st Marines</a>. Eight Marines were awarded the Navy Cross, the US military's second-highest award for valor, three of them posthumously. Sergeant <a href="Rafael%20Peralta">Rafael Peralta</a> was also unsuccessfully nominated for the Medal of Honor.

Officials estimated they had killed between 1,000 and 1,600 insurgents and detained another 1,000 out of an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 insurgents who were believed to be in the city. Aircraft dropped 318 precision bombs, launched 391 rockets and missiles, and fired 93,000 machine gun or cannon rounds on the city, while artillery units fired 5,685 rounds of <a href="m107%20projectile">155 mm</a> shells. The <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> estimated that 250,000 out of 300,000 residents had left the city during the fighting. A Baghdad Red Cross official unofficially estimated that up to 800 civilians were killed.

The Second Battle of Fallujah was unique in the Anbar campaign, in that it was the only time the US military and the insurgents waged a <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division-level</a> <a href="Conventional%20warfare">conventional engagement</a>. During the rest of the Anbar campaign, the insurgents never stood and fought in numbers that large. The official Marine Corps history claimed that the battle was not decisive, because most of the insurgent leadership and non-local insurgents had fled beforehand. Summing up the Marine Corps view, the United States Naval Institute's official magazine "Proceedings" said, "The Battle of Fallujah was not a defeat—but we cannot afford many more victories like it."

Following the Second Battle of Fallujah, the Marines faced three main tasks: providing humanitarian assistance to the hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city, retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in the run-up to the battle, and providing security for the <a href="Iraqi%20parliamentary%20election%2C%20January%202005">Iraqi parliamentary elections</a> scheduled for 30 January.
According to top Marine officials, the elections were designed to help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous <a href="Al-Anbar%20governorate%20council%20election%2C%202005">elections for the provincial council</a> were won by the <a href="Iraqi%20Islamic%20Party">Iraqi Islamic Party</a>, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.

During the run-up to the elections, a <a href="Sikorsky%20CH-53E%20Super%20Stallion">CH-53E</a> <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, killing all 31 Marines and sailors, most of whom were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle of Fallujah. This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War.
On 20 February, the Marines launched Operation River Blitz, their first major offensive of the year, centered in the western Euphrates River Valley against the cities of Ramadi, Hīt, and Baghdadi. Different units adopted different strategies. In Fallujah, the Marines surrounded the city with berms, banned all vehicles, and required residents to carry identification cards. In Ramadi, the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29%232nd%20Brigade%20Combat%20Team">2nd BCT</a> of the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">28th Infantry Division</a> focused on controlling the main roads and protecting the governor and government center. In western Anbar, the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Regiment</a> conducted <a href="search%20and%20destroy">search and destroy</a> missions, described as "<a href="cordon%20and%20search">cordon and search</a>", where they repeatedly pushed into enemy-controlled towns and then withdrew. On 2 April, a group of up to 60 AQI fighters <a href="Battle%20of%20Abu%20Ghraib">launched a major attack</a>, described as "one of the most sophisticated" seen to date, on the <a href="Baghdad%20Central%20Prison">Abu Ghraib prison</a>. The insurgents used a barrage of mortars, coupled with a suicide car bomb, in an unsuccessful attempt to breach the prison, wounding 44 US troops and 13 detainees.

By late February, a new threat emerged—the <a href="improvised%20explosive%20device">improvised explosive device</a> (IED). In 2005, 158 Marines and soldiers were killed by IEDs or suicide bombers, more than half (58 percent) of that year's combat deaths in Anbar. These numbers reflected a nationwide trend. While IEDs had been used since the beginning of the insurgency, the early models had been crudely designed, using "<a href="dynamite">dynamite</a> or <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> mixed with nails and buried beside a road". By mid-2005 the insurgents had refined their technique, triggering them by <a href="remote%20control">remote control</a>, stringing artillery shells or missiles together, using solid foundations to magnify the explosion, and burying them under roadways to inflict maximum damage. The US responded with a series of progressively more-sophisticated <a href="Radio%20jamming">electronic jamming</a> devices and other <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> programs which eventually consolidated into the <a href="Joint%20Improvised%20Explosive%20Device%20Defeat%20Organization">Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization</a>.

On 17 February, Brigadier General <a href="Dennis%20Hejlik">Dennis Hejlik</a> filed an urgent request with the Marine Corps for 1,200 <a href="MRAP">Mine Resistant Ambush Protected</a> (MRAP) vehicles, specifically designed to withstand IED attacks, for use in Anbar Province. In his request, General Hejlik added, "The [Marines] cannot continue to lose ... serious and grave casualties to IED[s]." The Marine Corps did not formally act on the request for 21 months. Hejlik later claimed that he was referring to IEDs which "tore into the sides of vehicles", and that the Marine Corps had determined that simply adding more armored Humvees would provide adequate protection. <a href="Whistleblower">Whistleblower</a> Franz Gayl disagreed, and wrote a report for Congress claiming that the request was shelved because the Marine Corps wanted to use the funds to develop the <a href="Joint%20Light%20Tactical%20Vehicle">Joint Light Tactical Vehicle</a>, a replacement for the Humvee not scheduled to become operational until 2012. Some Army personnel complained that the Marines took an almost casual attitude towards IEDs. One Army officer in Ramadi complained that, after warning about the large number of IEDs on a particular route, he was told, "Unless there are people melting inside of Humvees, then it's not a real problem."

By the spring of 2005, both the US and Iraqi governments concluded that the biggest problem facing Iraq was <a href="Terrorist%20incidents%20in%20Iraq%20in%202005">AQI's car bombings in Baghdad</a>. But while the Iraqis wanted to concentrate on Baghdad's <a href="Baghdad%20Belts">suburban belts</a> where the vehicles were being assembled, MNF–I commander General <a href="George%20W.%20Casey%2C%20Jr.">George Casey</a> concluded the real problem was pro-insurgent <a href="Iraqi%20insurgency%20%28Iraq%20War%29%23Foreign%20participants">foreign fighters</a> coming across the Syrian border. He ordered the Marines to launch a campaign that summer to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley (WERV).<ref name="3/25KIA"></ref>

On 7 May a platoon from <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2025th%20Marines">3rd Battalion 25th Marines</a> near Haditha was nearly overrun by insurgents, but ultimately rescued by one of its <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s who was later awarded the Navy Cross. The next day the 2nd Marine Regiment began clearing insurgent havens in the WERV. The first major attack was <a href="Battle%20of%20Al%20Qaim">Operation Matador</a>, against the town of <a href="Ubaydi">Ubaydi</a>, which CENTCOM claimed was an insurgent staging area. Both 3rd Battalion 25th Marines and <a href="3rd%20Battalion%202nd%20Marines">3rd Battalion 2nd Marines</a> participated in the attack. In most cases the insurgents vanished, leaving behind <a href="booby%20trap">booby trap</a>s and mines. At least nine Marines were killed and 40 wounded in the operation, but the insurgents apparently returned to the town afterwards.

AQI was interested in the WERV too. Zarqawi had reclaimed his base in western Anbar, declared <a href="Al-Qa%27im%20%28town%29">Al Qaim</a> as his capital, and was also operating in Hit and the Haditha Triad. On 8 May, the insurgent group <a href="Jamaat%20Ansar%20al-Sunna">Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna</a> ambushed and killed a dozen <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> near Hīt. Two days later, Anbar Governor <a href="Raja%20Nawaf%20Farhan%20al-Mahalawi">Raja Nawaf Farhan al-Mahalawi</a> was kidnapped and killed by insurgents near Rawah. He was replaced by <a href="Maamoon%20Sami%20Rasheed%20al-Alwani">Maamoon Sami Rasheed al-Alwani</a>.

MEF then began a series of operations in July, under the aegis of <a href="Operation%20Sayeed">Operation Sayeed</a>; in addition to clearing AQI from the WERV, Sayeed was also an attempt to set the conditions for the Anbaris to participate in the December constitutional referendum. They carried out <a href="List%20of%20coalition%20military%20operations%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War">countless operations</a>, with names like <a href="Operation%20New%20Market">New Market</a>, Sword, Hunter, Zoba, Spear, River Gate, and Iron Fist, ultimately culminating in November's <a href="Operation%20Steel%20Curtain">Operation Steel Curtain</a>. In August, the 3rd Battalion 25th Marines conducted <a href="Battle%20of%20Haditha">Operation Quick Strike</a>, a cordon and search operation in the Haditha Triad. Twenty Marines were killed in two days: six snipers were ambushed and killed by Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna on 1 August, and fourteen Marines were killed on 3 August when their <a href="Assault%20Amphibious%20Vehicle">Amphibious Assault Vehicle</a> was hit by a mine outside of Haditha.

By October, more Americans had been killed in Anbar than anywhere else in Iraq and senior Marines had switched from talk about victory to simply "containing the violence and smuggling at a level that Iraqi forces can someday handle."

On 5 November, the 2nd Marine Regiment launched <a href="Operation%20Steel%20Curtain">Operation Steel Curtain</a> against the border town of <a href="Husaybah">Husaybah</a>. The Marines reported that ten Marines and 139 insurgents died in the offensive. Medical workers in Husaybah claimed that 97 civilians were killed. On 1 December, ten Marines from 2nd Battalion 7th Marines were killed by a massive IED while on a foot patrol in Fallujah.

On 15 October, the people of Anbar went to the polls to decide whether or not to <a href="Iraqi%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202005">ratify the new constitution</a>. While the turnout (259,919 voters or 32% of eligible voters) was significantly higher than in the January elections, the results were similar: about 97% of the voters rejected the constitution. On 15 December, there was a follow-up election for the <a href="Iraqi%20parliamentary%20election%2C%20December%202005">Iraqi parliament</a>. Turn-out was even greater: 585,429 voters, or 86% of eligible voters.

AQI launched a series of attacks in <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar. The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the <a href="Trebil">Trebil</a> checkpoint along the Jordanian border with Anbar Province in December 2004. In August, two US warships in <a href="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>, the <a href="USS%20Kearsarge%20%28LHD-3%29">USS "Kearsarge"</a> and the <a href="USS%20Ashland%20%28LSD-48%29">USS "Ashland"</a>, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into Iraq. On 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out <a href="2005%20Amman%20bombings">suicide bombings in Amman</a>, killing 60. A fourth bomber, also from Anbar, was caught.

In May 2006, the Marine Corps was rocked by allegations that a squad from 3rd Battalion 1st Marines had gone "on a rampage" the previous November, killing 24 unarmed Iraqi men, women and children in Haditha. The incident had occurred on 19 November 2005, following a mine attack on a convoy that killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. A squad of Marines led by <a href="Staff%20sergeant">Staff Sergeant</a> <a href="Frank%20Wuterich">Frank Wuterich</a> had been riding in the convoy and immediately assumed control of the scene.
Following the mine attack, the Marines stopped a white Opel sedan carrying five Iraqi men and shot them after they tried to run away, before the platoon commander arrived and took charge. The Marines say they were then fired upon from a nearby house, and Wuterich's men were ordered "to take the house". Both Iraqi and Marine eyewitnesses later agreed that Wutterich's squad cleared the house (and several nearby ones) by throwing in grenades, then entering the houses and shooting the occupants. They differed over whether the killings had been permitted under the rules of engagement. The Marines claimed that the houses had been "declared hostile" and that training dictated "that all individuals in a hostile house are to be shot." Iraqis claimed the Marines had deliberately targeted civilians. In addition to the five Iraqi men killed by the sedan, nineteen other men, women, and children were killed by Wutterich's squad as they cleared the houses.

Internal investigations were started in February by the Multi-National Force – Iraq, the <a href="Naval%20Criminal%20Investigative%20Service">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> (which examined the actual killings), and Major General <a href="Eldon%20Bargewell">Eldon Bargewell</a> (who examined the Marines' response to the killings). A news article that alleged a massacre had occurred was published in March. Haditha became a national story in mid-May due to comments made by anti-war Congressman and former Marine <a href="John%20Murtha">John P. Murtha</a>. Murtha incorrectly claimed the number of civilians killed was much higher than reported and that the Marines had "killed innocent civilians in cold blood." Murtha's broader point about troop misbehavior was reinforced by news of <a href="Hamdania%20incident">another killing</a> where a squad of Marines executed an Iraqi man and then planted an AK-47 near his body in Hamdania, near <a href="Abu%20Ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a>, as well as the controversial Internet video <a href="Hadji%20Girl">Hadji Girl</a>, showing a Marine joking about killing members of an Iraqi family.

The military's internal investigation was concluded in June. Though Bargewell found no evidence of a cover-up, his report seriously criticized the Marine Corps for what he described as "inattention and negligence" as well as "an unwillingness, bordering on denial" by officers, especially senior officers, to investigate civilian deaths. MEF commander General Stephen Johnson later said that civilian deaths occurred "all the time", and did not find the high number of deaths to be particularly unusual. He referred to the deaths as "the cost of doing business on that particular engagement." On 21 December 2006, the US military charged eight Marines in connection with the Haditha incident. Four of the eight, including Wuterich, were accused of unpremeditated murder. On 3 October 2007, the <a href="Article%2032%20hearing">preliminary hearing</a> investigating officer recommended that charges of murder be dropped and that Wuterich be tried for <a href="negligent%20homicide">negligent homicide</a> instead. Six defendants subsequently had their cases dropped and one was found not guilty. In 2012, Wuterich pleaded guilty to negligent <a href="dereliction%20of%20duty">dereliction of duty</a> in exchange for all other charges against him being dropped. At least three officers, including battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Jeffrey%20Chessani">Jeffrey Chessani</a>, were officially reprimanded for failing to properly report and investigate the killings.

In June 2006, Colonel <a href="Sean%20MacFarland">Sean MacFarland</a> and the <a href="1st%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29%23HHC%2C%201st%20Brigade%2C%201st%20Armored%20Division">1st Brigade Combat Team</a> (BCT) of the <a href="1st%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Armored Division</a> were sent to Ramadi. Colonel MacFarland was told to "Fix Ramadi, but don't do a Fallujah." Many Iraqis assumed the 1st BCT was preparing for exactly that type of operation, with over 77 <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> tanks and 84 <a href="Bradley%20Fighting%20Vehicle">Bradley Fighting Vehicle</a>s, but Colonel MacFarland had another plan. Prior to Ramadi, the 1st BCT had been stationed in the northern city of <a href="Tal%20Afar">Tal Afar</a>, where Colonel <a href="H.%20R.%20McMaster">H. R. McMaster</a> in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation: "<a href="Clear%20and%20hold">Clear, Hold, Build</a>". Under McMaster's approach, his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been "cleared" of insurgents, then "held" it until Iraqi security forces were gradually "built" to a level where they could assume control. As in other offensive operations, many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle. The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi's most dangerous neighborhoods and, beginning in July, built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process. On 24 July, AQI launched a counterattack, launching 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. Despite the reported presence of AQI leader <a href="Abu%20Ayyub%20al-Masri">Abu Ayyub al-Masri</a>, the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men. Several senior American officers, including General <a href="David%20Petraeus">David Petraeus</a>, later compared the fighting to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a>. Despite the success, Multi-National Force – Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a secondary front to the ongoing <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Iraq%20%282006-07%29">civil war in Baghdad</a> and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland's battalions to Baghdad. Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as "trying to take the heat off Baghdad."

U.S. Marines of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, swept through urban sprawl between <a href="Ramadi">Ramadi</a> and <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a> in a series of operations (i.e. Operations <a href="List%20of%20coalition%20military%20operations%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War">RUBICON and SIDEWINDER</a>), disrupting flow of Al-Qaeda and Sunni insurgents into both cities, and killing and capturing over 300 insurgents. Action centered around Kilo Company, nicknamed "Voodoo", in the towns of Husaybah, Bidimnah, and Julaybah on the outskirts of Ramadi. Kilo Marines killed or captured 137 insurgents; 4 Marines were killed in action, and 17 were wounded. Within Kilo itself, the squad most affected was "Voodoo Mobile", the vehicle-mounted element of the unit's HQ section. Of its 16 members, 12 were wounded and 3 killed between September and November 2006.
During the seven-month deployment, fighting between <a href="Al%20Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a> and the Marines was largely sporadic but intense. While only a handful of large-scale firefights developed - mostly in the suburbs of Ramadi between Habbaniyah and Julaybah - contact between the two sides was nearly continuous. Kilo Company officers reported sniper fire on a daily basis, as well as IED strikes on over 200 of the 250 + vehicle patrols they mounted.

Operations consisted of a mixed array of company-scale urban "sweep-and-clear" operations, census and suppression patrols, and static, fortified area-denial positions. The battalion was spread out along a 30 kilometer front from the western fringes of Fallujah to the eastern boundary of Ramadi.

During the battle, 14 Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines were killed and at least 123 were wounded. 12 of the 14 were killed by IED strikes, while the other two suffered mortal wounds from sniper fire.

As the 1st Brigade pushed into Ramadi, it began aggressively courting the local tribes for police recruits. This was critical because, according to Colonel MacFarland, "without their help, we would not be able to recruit enough police to take back the entire city." After the Americans promised the tribal leaders in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city, the tribes began sending men into the police force. The number of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 a month before June 2006 to 300 a month by July. AQI tried to blunt police recruitment by attacking one of the new Ramadi police stations with a car bomb on 21 August, killing three Iraqi police. They simultaneously assassinated the Sunni sheikh of the Abu Ali Jassim tribe, who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join the <a href="Iraqi%20Police">Iraqi Police</a>. The AQI fighters hid the body instead of leaving it for the tribe, violating Islam's <a href="Islamic%20funeral">funeral rites</a> and angering the tribe. This was one of the catalysts for what became a tribal revolt against AQI. According to <a href="David%20Kilcullen">David Kilcullen</a>, who would later serve as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to General Petraeus, the revolt began after AQI killed a sheikh over his refusal to give his daughters to them in marriage.
During this time, one of Colonel MacFarland's subordinates, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Deane, had kept contact with a low-level sheikh from the Abu Risha tribe, <a href="Abdul%20Sattar%20Abu%20Risha">Abdul Sattar Abu Risha</a>. In 2004 and 2005, Sattar's father and three of his brothers had been killed by AQI, but he had refused exile. In early September, Sattar told Deane that his tribe and several others were planning to ally with the United States and throw out the Baghdad-based government. Dean informed Colonel MacFarland, who pledged to support Sattar as long as Sattar continued to back the Government of Iraq. On 9 September, Sattar and former Anbar Governor <a href="Fasal%20al%20Gaood">Fasal al Gaood</a>, along with 50 other sheikhs, announced the formation of the <a href="Sons%20of%20Iraq">Anbar Awakening</a> movement. Shortly after the meeting, Colonel MacFarland began hearing reports that off-duty Iraqi police operating as the military wing of the Awakening had formed a shadowy <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a> organization called "Thuwar al-Anbar". Thuwar al-Anbar conducted terror attacks against known AQI operatives, while Colonel MacFarland and his soldiers turned a blind eye.

Colonel MacFarland asked his tribal adviser, Captain <a href="Travis%20Patriquin">Travis Patriquin</a>, to prepare a brief for the Iraqi government and the MEF's staff and journalists, all of whom remained skeptical about arming Sunni tribes who might someday fight the Shi'a-led government.

Following the formation of the Awakening movement, violence in Ramadi continued to increase. On 29 September 2006 an insurgent threw a grenade onto a rooftop where a group of <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">Navy SEALs</a> were positioned. One of them, <a href="Master-at-arms%23United%20States%20Navy">Master-at-Arms</a> <a href="Petty%20Officer%20Second%20Class">Second Class</a> <a href="Michael%20A.%20Monsoor">Michael A. Monsoor</a>, quickly smothered the grenade with his body and was killed. He was later awarded the Medal of Honor. On 18 October, AQI's umbrella organization, the <a href="Mujahideen%20Shura%20Council%20%28Iraq%29">Mujahideen Shura Council</a>, formally declared Ramadi as a part of the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq">Islamic State of Iraq</a>.

Even as the Awakening progressed, Anbar continued to be viewed as a lost cause. In mid-August, Colonel Peter Devlin, chief of intelligence for the Marine Corps in Iraq, had given a particularly blunt briefing on the Anbar situation to General <a href="Peter%20Pace">Peter Pace</a>, <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. Devlin told Pace that the US could not militarily defeat AQI in Anbar Province, as "AQI has become an integral part of the social fabric of western Iraq." He added that AQI had "eliminated, subsumed, marginalized, or co-opted" all other Sunni insurgents, tribes, or government institutions in the province. Devlin believed that the only way to reestablish control over the province was to deploy an additional division to Anbar, coupled with billions of dollars of aid, or by creating a "sizeable and legally approved paramilitary force". He concluded that all the Marines had accomplished was preventing things from being "far worse". In early September, Colonel Devlin's report was leaked to the <a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>.
MEF commander Major General Richard Zilmer responded to press queries about the statement that Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added that if he were asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.

Some of the first offensive operations outside of Ramadi also began in late 2006, with the construction of high dirt berms around several Iraqi cities in western Anbar: Haditha, <a href="Haqlaniyah">Haqlaniyah</a>, <a href="Barwanah">Barwanah</a>, <a href="Ar%20Rutba">Rutbah</a>, and <a href="Anah">Anah</a>. The berming was part of <a href="Operation%20Al%20Majid">Operation Al Majid</a>, an American-led operation to clear and hold more than in western Anbar. Prior to Al Majid, a previous battalion commander had observed that his unit lacked the manpower to control both the main roads and towns of the Haditha Triad, that the Iraqi Army was as blind as they were, and that the insurgents were killing anyone who spoke to Coalition forces. The <a href="2nd%20Battalion%203rd%20Marines">2nd Battalion 3rd Marines</a> had lost over 23 Marines in just two months trying to hold the area. In addition to the berms and the help of a local strongman known as Colonel Faruq, the Marines set up checkpoints in key locations to regulate entry and exit. By early January, attacks in the Triad had dropped from 10–13 per day to one every few days.

The <a href="Iraq%20Study%20Group%20Report">Iraq Study Group Report</a>, released on 6 December, acknowledged that the Awakening movement had "started to take action", but concluded that "Sunni Arabs have not made the strategic decision to abandon violent insurgency in favor of the political process" and that the overall situation in Anbar was "deteriorating". On the same day, Captain Patriquin was killed by a roadside bomb in Ramadi along with Major <a href="Megan%20McClung">Megan McClung</a>, the first female Marine officer to die in Iraq. Following the <a href="execution%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein">execution of Saddam Hussein</a>, Saddam's family considered interring him in Ramadi because of the improved security situation. On 30 December, an unknown number of loyalists near Ramadi staged a march carrying pictures of Saddam Hussein and waving Iraqi flags.

In his <a href="2007%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a> on 23 January 2007, President Bush announced plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in what became known as <a href="Iraq%20War%20troop%20surge%20of%202007">the Surge</a>. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: <a href="1st%20Battalion%206th%20Marines">1st Battalion 6th Marines</a>, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the <a href="15th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">15th Marine Expeditionary Unit</a> (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the <a href="13th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">13th MEU</a> as the last surge unit.

AQI had its own offensives planned for 2007. In the first two months of 2007, it <a href="List%20of%20aviation%20shootdowns%20and%20accidents%20during%20the%20Iraq%20War%232007">shot down eight helicopters</a> throughout Iraq, including two in Anbar. One was brought down by a sophisticated <a href="9K34%20Strela-3">SA-14</a> or <a href="9K38%20Igla">SA-16</a> shoulder-fired missile on 7 February, near Karmah, killing five Marines and two sailors. AQI also began a series of <a href="Chlorine%20bombings%20in%20Iraq">chlorine bombings</a> near Ramadi and Fallujah. The first attack was on 21 October 2006, when a car bomb carrying twelve 120 mm mortar shells and two chlorine tanks was detonated in Ramadi. The AQI campaign intensified in January 2007. For five months, AQI carried out a series of suicide bombings in Anbar using conventional vehicle-borne explosive devices mixed with <a href="chlorine">chlorine gas</a>. The attacks in general were poorly executed, burning the chemical agent rather than dispersing it.

AQI also continued its assassination campaign. On 19 February, AQI tried to kill Sheikh Sattar in his compound with a pair of suicide car bombs that missed the sheikh, but killed eleven. Several days later the Habbaniyah mosque of an imam who had spoken out against AQI was hit by a suicide bomber during <a href="Jumu%27ah">Friday prayers</a>, with 39 killed and 62 wounded. In June, a group of Anbar sheiks meeting in Baghdad's <a href="Mansour%20Hotel">Mansour Hotel</a> was attacked by a suicide bomber, with 13 killed, including Fasal al Gaood, and 27 wounded. On 30 June, a group of 70 AQI fighters planned to carry out a major attack on Ramadi targeting tribal leaders and police in the city, including Sheikh Sattar. Instead they stumbled into a squad from the <a href="77th%20Armor%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Battalion, 77th Armor Regiment</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Donkey%20Island">near Donkey Island</a>, and fought an all-night engagement that resulted in thirteen Americans dead or wounded and half the AQI fighters killed.

As the campaign in Al Anbar entered its fourth year the Marine Corps scored a major victory when it adopted a vehicle originally designed in the 1970s to withstand mine attacks: the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. As early as 2004, the Marine Corps recognized that it needed a replacement for its armored Humvees. The few <a href="Cougar%20%28vehicle%29">Cougar</a> MRAP initially deployed yielded impressive results. In 2004, the Marines reported that no troops had died in over 300 mine attacks on Cougars. In April 2007, General Conway estimated that the widespread use of the MRAP could reduce mine casualties in Anbar by as much as 80 percent. Now <a href="Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, he requested an additional 3,000 MRAPs for Anbar and told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he wanted to require every Marine traveling outside bases to ride in one. In April, the Deputy Commander for MEF said that in the 300 attacks on MRAPs in Anbar since January 2006, no Marines had been killed. On 8 May 2007, Secretary of Defense <a href="Robert%20Gates">Robert Gates</a> stated that the acquisition of MRAPs was the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>'s highest priority and earmarked 1.1 billion US dollars for them. The Marine Corps purchased and fielded large numbers of MRAPs throughout 2007. That October, General Conway described the MRAP as the "gold standard" of force protection. Deaths from mine attacks plummeted and in June 2008, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" reported that roadside bomb attacks and fatalities in Iraq had dropped almost 90 percent, partially due to MRAPs.

In June the Marine Corps launched <a href="Operation%20Alljah">Operation Alljah</a> to secure Fallujah, Karma, <a href="Zaidon">Zaidon</a>, and the <a href="Lake%20Tharthar">Tharthar</a> regions of eastern Anbar. These regions fell under the umbrella of <a href="Operation%20Phantom%20Thunder">Operation Phantom Thunder</a>, an overall offensive throughout Iraq using US and Iraqi divisions on multiple fronts in an attempt to clear the areas surrounding Baghdad. In late 2006, the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2025th%20Marines">1st Battalion 25th Marines</a> had turned Fallujah over to the Iraqi Army and Police, who preferred to stay in defensive checkpoints and not patrol the city. Colonel Richard Simcock, whose <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Regiment</a> would retake the city, later admitted that the Marines had pulled out too soon. In June, he sent the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%206th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 6th Marines</a> into Fallujah, dividing it up into ten precincts and sending Marines and Iraqi Police into each precinct in a duplication of 1st Battalion 6th Marines' operations in Ramadi.
In May, General Gaskin began planning to retake the city of Karmah, which sat astride a main supply route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of his aides to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with <a href="2nd%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 5th Marines</a>. By October, insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero.

In May, the 13th MEU moved into Tharthar, a area that was AQI's last Anbar refuge. Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between Anbar and Salahuddin Provinces into Baghdad and to uncover weapons caches. Resistance was light and many insurgents fled. The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down. In one operation, Marines found 18 tons of homemade explosives and of <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> fertilizer. They uncovered several <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s, containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI. Tharthar was cleared by August. Operation Alljah was one of the last significant Anbar offensives. By late October, weeks passed without casualties.

President Bush flew to Al Asad Airbase in western Anbar Province on 3 September, to showcase what he referred to as a "military success" and "what the future of Iraq can look like". While there, he met with top US and Iraqi leadership and held a "war council". <a href="Frederick%20Kagan">Frederick Kagan</a>, one of the "intellectual architects" of the Surge, referred to the visit as the "<a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a>" of the Iraq War and observed that Bush thought Anbar was "safe enough for the war cabinet of the United States of America to meet there with the senior leadership of the government of Iraq to discuss strategy."

A week after Bush's visit, on 10 September, General David Petraeus, the <a href="Commanding%20officer">Commanding General</a> of Multi-National Force – Iraq, and <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Iraq">United States Ambassador to Iraq</a> <a href="Ryan%20Crocker">Ryan Crocker</a> gave their <a href="Report%20to%20Congress%20on%20the%20Situation%20in%20Iraq">Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq</a>. General Petraeus specifically singled out Anbar Province as a major improvement, referring to the tribal uprisings there as "the most significant development of the past 8 months". He mentioned the dramatic improvements in security, stating that enemy attacks had decreased from a high of 1,350 in October 2006 to approximately 200 in August 2007. Ambassador Crocker referred to Anbar Province in his Congressional testimony. He was careful to credit the victory to AQI "overplay[ing] its hand" and to the tribal uprising being directed primarily against the "excesses" of AQI. He also referred to the Government of Iraq recruiting "21,000 Anbaris [in] police roles", a carefully chosen phrase as many of them were tribal militia. The two referred to Anbar Province a total of 24 times in their testimony.

Three days later, on 13 September, Sheikh Sattar and three other men were killed by a bomb planted near his house in Ramadi. AQI claimed responsibility for the attack and twenty people were arrested in connection with the killing, including the Sheikh's own head of security. About 1,500 mourners attended Sheikh Sattar's funeral, including senior Iraqi and American officials. The leadership of the <a href="Anbar%20Salvation%20Council">Anbar Salvation Council</a> then passed to Sheikh Sattar's brother Sheikh <a href="Ahmed%20Abu%20Risha">Ahmed Abu Risha</a>. In December, <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> deputy leader <a href="Ayman%20al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a> released an interview where he denied that the tribes of Anbar Province were supporting the Americans, praising them as "noble and honorable" and referring to the Awakening as "scum".

Beginning in February 2008, US forces began returning political and military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, <a href="1st%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">1st Battalion 7th Marines</a> withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant to show off the Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">1st</a> and <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">7th Divisions</a>, were sent south to participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Basra%20%282008%29">Battle of Basra</a>. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of <a href="Task%20Force%2088%20%28anti-terrorist%20unit%29%23Task%20Force%20Black/Knight">Task Force Knight</a> were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.

Earlier in January, AQI leader Ayyub al-Masri ordered his fighters in Anbar to "get away from the massive indiscriminate killings" and "refocus attacks on American troops, Sunnis cooperating closely with U.S. forces, and Iraq's infrastructure." AQI also ordered its fighters to avoid targeting Sunni tribesman, and even offered amnesty towards Awakening tribal leaders. On 19 April, al-Masri called for a month-long offensive against US and Iraqi forces. In Anbar Province, that offensive may have begun four days earlier on 15 April, when 18 people (including five Iraqi police) were killed in two suicide bombings near Ramadi. On 22 April, a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into an entry-control point in Ramadi manned by over 50 Marines and Iraqi police. Two Marines engaged the driver who detonated his bomb early, killing the guards and wounding 26 Iraqis. Both Marines were posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. On 8 May, a group of insurgents crossed the Syrian border near Al Qaim and killed 11 Iraqi policemen and military officers. That same day, four Marines were killed in a roadside blast in Lahib, a farming village just east of Karmah. On 16 May, a suicide car bomber attacked a Fallujah police station, killing four and wounding nine.
In June, it was announced that Anbar Province would be the tenth province to transfer to <a href="Provincial%20Iraqi%20Control">Provincial Iraqi Control</a>, the first such Sunni region. This handover was delayed by bad weather and a suicide bombing on 26 June <a href="26%20June%202008%20Karmah%20Bombing">in Karmah</a> at a meeting between Sunni Sheikhs and US Marines which killed more than 23 people, including three Marines. In July, presidential candidate <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> visited Ramadi and met with Governor Rasheed, Sheikh Abu Rish, and 30 other sheikhs and senior military personnel. In the meeting, Obama promised that "the United States will not abandon Iraq" (his opponent, <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, had visited Haditha in March 2008). On 26 August, Iraqi leaders signed the Command and Control Memorandum of Understanding in a ceremony at the Anbar Governance Center, a step towards taking full control and responsibility for security from Coalition forces. Less than a week later, on 1 September, the transition became official.

The last major military action in Anbar Province occurred on 26 October 2008, when a group of <a href="Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Army Special Forces</a> conducted <a href="2008%20Abu%20Kamal%20raid">a raid into Syria</a> to kill <a href="Abu%20Ghadiya">Abu Ghadiya</a>, the leader of a network of foreign fighters who were traveling through Syria. Anbar continued to play a large role in the Iraqi insurgency. That same month AQI announced the formation of the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq">Islamic State of Iraq</a> (ISI), an umbrella group led by <a href="Abu%20Abdullah%20al-Rashid%20al-Baghdadi">Abu Omar al-Baghdadi</a>, a cleric from Anbar. After both Al-Baghdadi and Al-Masri were killed in <a href="Tikrit">Tikrit</a> in April 2010, the US believed the new leader of AQI/ISI was <a href="Abu%20Dua">Abu Dua al-Badri</a>, a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah.

In late 2008, US forces began accelerating their move out of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain <a href="Scott%20Speicher">Scott Speicher</a>, who had been missing in action since the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike in the number of suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.

There were <a href="2009%20Al%20Anbar%20VBIED%20Campaign">a number of car bombings</a> in Ramadi, Haditha and Al Qaim following the US withdrawal from Iraqi cities on 30 June. Throughout the last months of the year, additional attacks, mainly assassinations, occurred around Fallujah and Abu Ghraib. In October, twin bombings killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi. In December, a coordinated double suicide bombing outside Ramadi's government compound killed 25 people and severely wounded Governor <a href="Qasim%20Al-Fahdawi">Qasim Al-Fahdawi</a>, who lost an arm.

Violence continued through the last months of 2011. In September, a bus carrying Shia pilgrims from neighboring <a href="Karbala%20Province">Karbala Governorate</a> was stopped outside of Ramadi and 22 were executed, prompting threats from <a href="Karbala">Karbala</a> to annex parts of southern Anbar Province, including the city of <a href="Nukhayb">Nukhayb</a>. In November, the provincial council in Anbar announced that it was considering whether to form a semi-autonomous region with other provinces in the Sunni areas of Iraq.

As the Americans withdrew, many Iraqis and Americans questioned the ability of the Iraqi security forces, especially the police, to protect the province. Others expressed skepticism over whether Iran would dominate Iraq and whether the Iraqi government would be able to provide security. One angry Iraqi described the American legacy as "total destruction ... you just came in, destroyed, and left." Discussing the American withdrawal, a journalist in Fallujah predicted that the Government of Iraq would continue to have trouble with Anbar Province, saying, "Anbar was where instability began in Iraq. It was where stability returned. And it is where instability could start again."

The United States military in Anbar Province had a series of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force – West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division – Baghdad, creating United States Division – Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">25th Infantry Division</a> assumed responsibility for Anbar Province. On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province, Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the pullout by <a href="Flag%20desecration">burning American flags</a> in the city.

Both sides committed human rights abuses in Anbar Province, often involving civilians caught in the middle of the conflict. By late 2005, abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to "discovering ... 20 bodies here, 20 bodies there" and the head of MNF-W referred to them as "a cost of doing business." During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy.

For the American forces, abuses were typically either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing <a href="extrajudicial%20killing">extrajudicial killing</a>s (such as <a href="Haditha%20killings">in Haditha</a>). Many accusations of human rights violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had <a href="White%20phosphorus%20use%20in%20Iraq%23Second%20major%20assault%20on%20Fallujah">employed white phosphorus</a> artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations <a href="Convention%20on%20Certain%20Conventional%20Weapons">Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons</a>. Several Marines, all of them from the 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing <a href="depleted%20uranium">depleted uranium</a> that caused <a href="birth%20defect">birth defect</a>s for years after the battle.

American forces also killed civilians through aerial bombing. Between 2003 and 2007, 1700 Iraqis on all sides were killed by aerial attack in Anbar Province. On 19 May 2004, 42 civilians were killed near Al Qaim when American planes mistakenly <a href="Mukaradeeb%20wedding%20party%20massacre">bombed a wedding party</a>. In November 2004, 59 civilians were killed when the US bombed Fallujah's Central Health Center. In November 2006, an American airstrike in Ramadi killed 30 civilians. Some accusations, such as the alleged bombing of a Fallujah mosque in April 2004 that killed 40, were later proven to be exaggerated or false.

An unknown number of Iraqis in Anbar were also killed through <a href="Escalation%20of%20Force">Escalation of Force</a> (EOF) incidents, where American troops were allowed to fire at suspicious-looking Iraqi vehicles and persons under their <a href="rules%20of%20engagement">rules of engagement</a>. These incidents typically occurred at both coalition checkpoints and near coalition convoys on the road. One civil affairs officer recounted two separate incidents in Ramadi where families in cars were fired on for not stopping at checkpoints: in one incident the husband was killed; in another, the wife died and a boy was critically wounded.

Other violations involved detainee abuse. An August 2003 memo on detainee interrogations prompted one soldier with the 3rd ACR in Anbar to reply that "the gloves need to come off." In November 2003, former Iraqi general <a href="Abed%20Hamed%20Mowhoush">Abed Hamed Mowhoush</a> died at a detention facility near Al Qaim after US Army interrogators stuffed him inside a sleeping bag and beat him to death. In 2005, several members of the 82nd Airborne described how in 2003 they beat and abused prisoners at Camp Mercury, a forward operating base near Fallujah. Iraqi security forces also committed abuses. In 2007, a Marine commander near Tharthar uncovered several instances of Iraqi soldiers raping civilians and Iraqi police torturing prisoners.

Finally, while not an abuse, there was a perception among some Iraqis that Americans did not care about them. A leading cleric in Anbar later complained that:

The various insurgent groups regularly executed and tortured suspected Iraqi collaborators and captured Westerners, as well as Iraqis they considered insufficiently religious. One Iraqi Christian told Human Rights Watch how he was stopped by insurgents in Anbar and ordered to convert to Islam or face death. Another Iraqi Shia related how insurgents from other Arab countries had expelled many <a href="Kurd">Kurd</a>s and Shi'ia from cities and executed others. After the Second Battle of Fallujah, American forces uncovered Al Qaeda torture and execution chambers, which had been used on Iraqis suspected of working with Westerners or the Iraqi government. Some of the chambers still contained victims. Some executions, like those of <a href="Nicholas%20Berg">Nicholas Berg</a> and Kim Sun-il, had been videotaped by their perpetrators. Some Fallujah residents stated that during the battle, Al Qaeda had shot anyone trying to leave.

In Haditha, after the Marines were withdrawn in order to fight in Fallujah, insurgents "rounded up dozens of local police officers and publicly executed them in a soccer stadium." When the Marines were withdrawn a second time later in 2004 there were similar massacres of local police. They enforced strict Islamic laws, such as breaking the fingers of smokers, whipping those who drank alcohol, and banning shops from selling images of women. An Iraqi woman from Ramadi said Al Qaeda banned women from driving or walking alone by themselves. AQI also abused local women, which antagonized some of the local tribes. Women, pretending to be seamstresses, were drafted to reconnoiter houses and report on the presence of Iraqi police in hiding. If they could not find the police, they would settle for killing their close relatives. They also murdered countless Iraqis: doctors, mullahs, college graduates, even women and children—anyone they thought might be connected to the Americans. In 2007, American Marines found several mass graves near <a href="Lake%20Tharthar">Lake Tharthar</a> containing a total of over 100 victims.

According to Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, many Iraqis became disaffected with AQI but were hesitant to take up arms against them out of fear. Sheikh Ahmed said that the biggest complaint about AQI was that they were unable to create a degree of normalcy, and that "people [who] are wearing masks ... cannot build the country". Other sheikhs specifically said that the large number of killings and kidnappings by AQI prompted the tribal revolt. AQI leader Ayyub al-Masri practically admitted as much in 2008 when he ordered fighters in Anbar to avoid harming Sunnis who were not working closely with coalition forces and "not interfere in social issues". However, David Kilcullen argued that the abuses themselves may have been less of an issue than AQI disrupting the tribes' smuggling businesses, the belief that AQI was linked to Iran, and their general "high-handed" behavior. He added that, whatever the spark, there was already a perception that AQI "had it coming".

In the United States, incidents like <a href="Iraq%20prison%20abuse%20scandals">detainee abuse</a> and the Haditha killings became front-page news, but many Iraqi deaths by American or Iraqi security forces went unreported. While the U.S. military claimed that "the vast majority" of Iraqi deaths were caused by other Iraqis, incidents like Fallujah and Haditha caused many Iraqis to become embittered towards the Americans. This later led to Iraqi outrage in 2011, when the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a long-term presence in Iraq that would give immunity to American military personnel. Iraqis were further angered by what they perceived as a "travesty of justice" over the lack of convictions of American military personnel. Writing in the aftermath of the Haditha killings, retired U.S. Army Colonel <a href="Andrew%20Bacevich">Andrew Bacevich</a> said:

1998 FA Charity Shield

The 1998 Football Association Charity Shield (also known as The <a href="AXA">AXA</a> FA Charity Shield for sponsorship reasons) was the 76th <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a>, an annual English <a href="association%20football">football</a> match organised by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> and played between the winners of the previous season's <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> competitions. It was contested on 9 August 1998 by <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> – who won a <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Premier%20League">league</a> and <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> the previous season – and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> – who finished runners-up in the league. Watched by a crowd of 67,342 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, Arsenal won the match 3–0.

This was Manchester United's 18th Charity Shield appearance to Arsenal's 14th. Manchester United began the game more strongly, but Arsenal took the lead when <a href="Marc%20Overmars">Marc Overmars</a> scored 11 minutes before half-time. They extended their lead in the second half, as Overmars and <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a> found <a href="Christopher%20Wreh">Christopher Wreh</a>, who put the ball into an empty net at the second attempt. In the 72nd minute, Arsenal scored a third goal, when Anelka got around <a href="Jaap%20Stam">Jaap Stam</a> in the penalty box and shot the ball past goalkeeper <a href="Peter%20Schmeichel">Peter Schmeichel</a>.

Arsenal's victory marked Manchester United's first Shield defeat in 13 years. The teams later faced each other in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Cup%23Semi-finals">FA Cup semi-final</a>, which was won by Manchester United in a replay. Manchester United finished the league season one point ahead of Arsenal and went on to win the FA Cup and <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, thereby completing a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of trophies in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a> season.

Founded in 1908 as a successor to the <a href="Sheriff%20of%20London%20Charity%20Shield">Sheriff of London Charity Shield</a>, the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> began as a contest between the respective champions of the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> and <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the top division and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> winners for the first time. The match was played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, which first hosted the Shield in 1974.

<a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> qualified for the 1998 FA Charity Shield as winners of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Premier%20League">1997–98 FA Premier League</a>. Although they were 12 points behind league leaders <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> by the end of February 1998, a nine-match winning streak, culminating in a 4–0 win over <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> on 3 May 1998, ensured Arsenal won the title. Arsenal beat <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> 2–0 in the <a href="1998%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1998 FA Cup Final</a> to complete the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">domestic double</a>. Given they won both honours, the other Charity Shield place went to league runners-up Manchester United.

The most recent meeting between the two teams was in the Premier League on 14 March 1998, when a second-half goal by <a href="Marc%20Overmars">Marc Overmars</a> gave Arsenal a 1–0 win at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>. Arsenal were the only team in the 1997–98 league to beat United home and away, with the corresponding home fixture ending 3–2. Arsenal manager <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> acknowledged the Shield game was the "only opportunity to play our first-team men together against top-class opposition" before their league campaign commenced the following week. Manchester United manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> was preoccupied with the team's match against <a href="%C5%81KS%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">ŁKS Łódź</a> in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Second%20qualifying%20round">second qualifying round</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> three days later. He felt the contest with Arsenal would get his "players' sharpness up and provide plenty of benefit" for their upcoming matches.

The match was officially referred to as "The AXA FA Charity Shield" as part of a sponsorship deal between <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> and French insurance group <a href="AXA">AXA</a>, agreed in July 1998. The deal also saw the FA Cup referred to as "The AXA Sponsored FA Cup" for its four-year duration.

Manchester United winger <a href="Jesper%20Blomqvist">Jesper Blomqvist</a> was ruled out with an ankle injury, but <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a> was fit enough to start his first competitive match since damaging his ligaments eleven months previously. Defender <a href="Jaap%20Stam">Jaap Stam</a>, who signed for United in May 1998, made his competitive debut for the club, partnering centre-back <a href="Ronny%20Johnsen">Ronny Johnsen</a>. For Arsenal, new signing <a href="Nelson%20Vivas">Nelson Vivas</a> began the match on the substitutes' bench, in spite of being expected to make his full debut, while <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a> started alongside <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a> up front.

Arsenal employed a traditional <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%934%E2%80%932">4–4–2</a> formation: a four-man <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defence</a> (comprising two <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre-back">centre-backs</a> and <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back">left and right full-backs</a>), four <a href="midfielders">midfielders</a> (two in the <a href="Central%20midfielder">centre</a>, and one on each <a href="Midfielders%23Wide%20midfielder">wing</a>) and two <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre%20forward">centre-forwards</a>. Manchester United organised themselves slightly differently, with <a href="Paul%20Scholes">Paul Scholes</a> playing ahead of the midfield in a supporting role behind the main striker, <a href="Andy%20Cole">Andy Cole</a>. The team lined up in a <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%934%E2%80%931%E2%80%931">4–4–1–1</a> formation.

In pitch-side temperatures of , Manchester United enjoyed their best spell of the match early on, while Arsenal's pair <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> and <a href="Emmanuel%20Petit">Emmanuel Petit</a> adjusted themselves. United fashioned their first chance through <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>, who was booed throughout the match on account of many fans blaming him for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>'s elimination from the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>. His pass eventually met Scholes, whose attempt forced Arsenal goalkeeper <a href="David%20Seaman">David Seaman</a> to clear. In spite of United's promising start, it was Arsenal who scored the opening goal. Vieira played the ball down the right side of the penalty area in the direction of Bergkamp and Anelka. Bergkamp got there first and back-heeled the ball to Anelka, but the Frenchman was unable to take control; however, he was able to put pressure on Johnsen in the Manchester United defence and blocked the Norwegian's attempted clearance. The ball ran across the edge of the penalty area to Overmars, who lashed it right-footed past Manchester United goalkeeper <a href="Peter%20Schmeichel">Peter Schmeichel</a> into the net. A shot by Keane from prompted a save from Seaman in the 42nd minute.

Arsenal began dominating in the second half, and increased their lead after 57 minutes. From the left wing, Overmars used his pace to get the better of <a href="Gary%20Neville">Gary Neville</a> and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked <a href="Christopher%20Wreh">Christopher Wreh</a>. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration. Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender <a href="Martin%20Keown">Martin Keown</a> almost put the ball into his own goal from <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a>'s corner. Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> and <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Boa%20Morte">Luís Boa Morte</a> coming on for Cole – who rarely threatened – and Petit, respectively. Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who got around Stam and shot the ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post. Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.

The result marked Manchester United's first Shield defeat in 13 years, and was the ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first southern club since <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in <a href="1962%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1962</a> to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as "unexpected" and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, who had been in the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge. This is a good start. It is harder to retain the trophy."

Ferguson admitted his team had been beaten by the better side and agreed with Wenger that the first goal was important. He was pleased that Keane got through the match after 11 months out of action and was confident his team would fare better against ŁKS Łódź, the following Wednesday. Schmeichel felt the upcoming Champions League qualifier was more important than the Charity Shield game, which he considered as a pre-season match. Ferguson anticipated another challenge from Arsenal in the league: "I think you could make a strong case for four teams to challenge for the Premiership but I think Arsenal pose the biggest threat."

Three days after the Charity Shield match, United beat ŁKS Łódź 2–0 and qualified for the Champions League group stage following a goalless match a fortnight later. Arsenal had the upper hand in their two league meetings with United during the season, winning 3–0 at <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a> in September 1998, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford in February 1999. The two teams went into the final day of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Premier%20League">1998–99 FA Premier League</a> vying for the title, but United's 2–1 win against Tottenham meant they finished one point above Arsenal. The two sides met twice more that season in the FA Cup semi-final, which was settled in a replay after the original match finished goalless. Manchester United won in <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> – the winning goal scored by Giggs. United then went on to defeat Newcastle United 2–0 in the <a href="1999%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1999 FA Cup Final</a>. Whereas Arsenal failed to progress past the group stage of the Champions League, Manchester United went on to reach the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>, where they beat <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> to win the competition for the second time. Ferguson's team therefore completed a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of trophies in one season.

Ganesha

Ganesha (, '; ), also known as Ganapati, Vinayaka, Pillaiyar and Binayak, is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the <a href="Hindu%20deities">Hindu pantheon</a>. His image is found throughout <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Bali">Bali (Indonesia)</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>. <a href="Hindu%20denominations">Hindu denominations</a> worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends <a href="Ganesha%20in%20world%20religions">to Jains and Buddhists</a>.

Although he is known by many attributes, Ganesha's <a href="elephant">elephant</a> head makes him easy to identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the <a href="Deva%20%28Hinduism%29">deva</a> of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate <a href="Mythological%20anecdotes%20of%20Ganesha">mythological anecdotes</a> associated with his birth and exploits. 

Ganesha likely emerged as a deity as early as the 2nd century CE, but most certainly by the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta period</a>, although He inherited traits from <a href="Vedas">Vedic</a> and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> and <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> of the <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a> tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the "<a href="Ganapatya">Ganapatya</a>" tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the "<a href="Ganesha%20Purana">Ganesha Purana</a>", the "<a href="Mudgala%20Purana">Mudgala Purana</a>", and the "<a href="Ganapati%20Atharvashirsa">Ganapati Atharvashirsa</a>". "<a href="Brahma%20Purana">Brahma Purana</a>" and "<a href="Brahmanda%20Purana">Brahmanda Purana</a>" are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.

Ganesha has been ascribed many other titles and epithets, including "Ganapati" ("Ganpati") and "Vighneshvara". The Hindu title of respect "<a href="Shri">Shri</a>" (; <a href="IAST">IAST</a>: ""; also spelled "Sri" or "Shree") is often added before his name.

The name "Ganesha" is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words "<a href="gana">gana</a>" (), meaning a group, multitude, or categorical system and "isha" (), meaning lord or master. The word "gaṇa" when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaṇas, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>, Ganesha's father. The term more generally means a category, class, community, association, or corporation. Some commentators interpret the name "Lord of the " to mean "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of created categories", such as the elements. "Ganapati" (; ), a synonym for "Ganesha", is a compound composed of ', meaning "group", and ', meaning "ruler" or "lord". Though the earliest mention of the word "Ganapati" is found in hymn 2.23.1 of the 2nd-millennium BCE "<a href="Rigveda">Rigveda</a>", it is however uncertain that the Vedic term referred specifically to Ganesha. The "<a href="Amarakosha">Amarakosha</a>", an early Sanskrit lexicon, lists eight synonyms of "Ganesha": "Vinayaka", ' (equivalent to "Vighnesha"), ' (one who has two mothers), ' (equivalent to "Ganapati" and "Ganesha"), "Ekadanta" (one who has one tusk), "<a href="Heramba">Heramba</a>", "Lambodara" (one who has a pot belly, or, literally, one who has a hanging belly), and "Gajanana" (""); having the face of an elephant.

"Vinayaka" (; ') is a common name for Ganesha that appears in the s and in Buddhist Tantras. This name is reflected in the naming of the eight famous Ganesha temples in Maharashtra known as the "<a href="Ashtavinayak">Ashtavinayak</a>" (, ). The names "Vighnesha" (; ') and "Vighneshvara" (; ') (Lord of Obstacles) refers to his primary function in Hinduism as the master and remover of obstacles (').

A prominent name for Ganesha in the <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil language</a> is "Pillai" () or "Pillaiyar" (). A.K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that "pillai" means a "child" while "pillaiyar" means a "noble child". He adds that the words "pallu", "pella", and "pell" in the <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian family of languages</a> signify "tooth or tusk", also "elephant tooth or tusk". Anita Raina Thapan notes that the <a href="Root%20%28linguistics%29">root word</a> "pille" in the name "Pillaiyar" might have originally meant "the young of the elephant", because the <a href="Pali">Pali</a> word "pillaka" means "a young elephant".

In the <a href="Burmese%20language">Burmese language</a>, Ganesha is known as "Maha Peinne" (, ), derived from <a href="Pali">Pali</a> (). The widespread name of Ganesha in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> is "Phra Phikanet". The earliest images and mention of Ganesha names as a major deity in present-day Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam date from the 7th- and 8th-centuries, and these mirror Indian examples of the 5th century or earlier.
In <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>n Singhala Buddhist areas, he is known as "Gana deviyo", and revered along with <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>, <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <a href="Kartikeya">Skanda</a> and others.

Ganesha is a popular figure in <a href="Indian%20art">Indian art</a>. Unlike those of some deities, representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time. He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, or sitting down on an elevated seat, or engaging in a range of contemporary situations.

Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of <a href="India">India</a> by the 6th century. The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900–1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973–1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost, and another similar statue is dated c. 12th century by Pratapaditya Pal. Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly. This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. He holds his own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature. A more primitive statue in one of the <a href="Ellora%20Caves">Ellora Caves</a> with this general form has been dated to the 7th century. Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an <a href="Parashu">axe</a> or a <a href="Ankus">goad</a> in one upper arm and a <a href="Pasha%20%28Hinduism%29">pasha</a> (<a href="noose">noose</a>) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.

The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness (abhaya <a href="mudra">mudra</a>). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.

Ganesha has been represented with the head of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art. Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head. One of his popular forms, "<a href="Heramba">Heramba-Ganapati</a>", has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the number of heads are known. While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories. The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a> using clay to protect her and <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant. Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from varying from source to source. Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.

Ganesha's earliest name was "Ekadanta" (One Tusked), referring to his single whole tusk, the other being broken. Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk. The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the "<a href="Mudgala%20Purana">Mudgala Purana</a>", which states that the name of Ganesha's second <a href="incarnation">incarnation</a> is Ekadanta. Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries). This feature is so important that according to the "Mudgala Purana", two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: "Lambodara" (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and "Mahodara" (Great Belly). Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (IAST: '). The "Brahmanda Purana" says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., <a href="World%20egg">cosmic eggs</a>; IAST: ') of the past, present, and future are present in him. The number of Ganesha's arms varies; his best-known forms have between two and sixteen arms. Many depictions of Ganesha feature four arms, which is mentioned in Puranic sources and codified as a standard form in some iconographic texts. His earliest images had two arms. Forms with 14 and 20 arms appeared in Central India during the 9th and the 10th centuries. The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms. According to the "Ganesha Purana", Ganesha wrapped the serpent <a href="Vasuki%20%28snake%29">Vasuki</a> around his neck. Other depictions of snakes include use as a sacred thread (IAST: ") wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne. Upon Ganesha's forehead may be a <a href="third%20eye">third eye</a> or the sectarian mark (IAST: ), which consists of three horizontal lines. The "Ganesha Purana" prescribes a "tilaka" mark as well as a crescent moon on the forehead. A distinct form of Ganesha called "Bhalachandra" (IAST: ""; "Moon on the Forehead") includes that iconographic element. Ganesha is often described as red in color. Specific colors are associated with certain forms. Many examples of color associations with specific meditation forms are prescribed in the Sritattvanidhi, a treatise on <a href="Hindu%20iconography">Hindu iconography</a>. For example, white is associated with his representations as "Heramba-Ganapati" and "Rina-Mochana-Ganapati" (Ganapati Who Releases from Bondage). "Ekadanta-Ganapati" is visualized as blue during meditation in that form.

The earliest Ganesha images are without a <a href="vahana">vahana</a> (mount/vehicle). Of <a href="Mudgala%20Purana%23The%20eight%20incarnations%20of%20Ganesha">the eight incarnations of Ganesha described in the "Mudgala Purana"</a>, Ganesha uses a mouse (shrew) in five of them, a lion in his incarnation as "Vakratunda", a peacock in his incarnation as "Vikata", and <a href="Shesha">Shesha</a>, the divine serpent, in his incarnation as "Vighnaraja". "Mohotkata" uses a lion, "" uses a peacock, "Dhumraketu" uses a horse, and "Gajanana" uses a mouse, in the <a href="Mahotkata">four incarnations of Ganesha</a> listed in the "Ganesha Purana". Jain depictions of Ganesha show his vahana variously as a mouse, elephant, tortoise, ram, or peacock.

Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a <a href="mouse">mouse</a>, <a href="shrew">shrew</a> or <a href="rat">rat</a>. Martin-Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century; the rat was always placed close to his feet. The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the "<a href="Matsya%20Purana">Matsya Purana</a>" and later in the "Brahmananda Purana" and "Ganesha Purana", where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle in his last incarnation. The <a href="Ganapati%20Atharvashirsa">Ganapati Atharvashirsa</a> includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag. The names ' (mouse-mount) and ' (rat-banner) appear in the "<a href="Ganesha%20Sahasranama">Ganesha Sahasranama</a>".

The mouse is interpreted in several ways. According to Grimes, "Many, if not most of those who interpret 's mouse, do so negatively; it symbolizes "<a href="Tamas%20%28philosophy%29"></a>" as well as desire". Along these lines, Michael Wilcockson says it symbolizes those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish. Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops. The Sanskrit word ' (mouse) is derived from the root ' (stealing, robbing). It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of "vighna" (impediment) that needed to be overcome. According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as "Vigneshvara" (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk "grāma-devatā" (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence. Martin-Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha, like the rat, penetrates even the most secret places.

Ganesha is "Vighneshvara" ("Vighnaraja," <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a> – "Vighnaharta)", the Lord of Obstacles, both of a material and spiritual order. He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked. Paul Courtright says that Ganesha's "dharma" and his raison d'etre is to create and remove obstacles.

Krishan notes that some of Ganesha's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time. Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the , to this shift in emphasis from ' (obstacle-creator) to ' (obstacle-averter). However, both functions continue to be vital to his character.

Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning. In Sanskrit, the word "<a href="buddhi">buddhi</a>" is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect. The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha, especially in the Puranic period, when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence. One of Ganesha's names in the "<a href="Ganesha%20Purana">Ganesha Purana</a>" and the "<a href="Ganesha%20Sahasranama">Ganesha Sahasranama</a>" is "Buddhipriya". This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the "Ganesha Sahasranama" that Ganesha says are especially important. The word "priya" can mean "fond of", and in a marital context it can mean "lover" or "husband", so the name may mean either "Fond of Intelligence" or "Buddhi's Husband".

Ganesha is identified with the Hindu <a href="mantra">mantra</a> <a href="Om">Om</a>, also spelled "Aum". The term "" (Om is his form), when identified with Ganesha, refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound. The "<a href="Ganapati%20Atharvashirsa">Ganapati Atharvashirsa</a>" attests to this association. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:

Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Om in the <a href="Devanagari">Devanāgarī</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> scripts.

According to <a href="Kundalini%20yoga">Kundalini yoga</a>, Ganesha resides in the first <a href="chakra">chakra</a>, called <a href="Muladhara">Muladhara</a> (). "Mula" means "original, main"; "adhara" means "base, foundation". The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests. This association is also attested to in the "Ganapati Atharvashirsa". Courtright translates this passage as follows: "You continually dwell in the <a href="sacral%20plexus">sacral plexus</a> at the base of the spine []." Thus, Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara. Ganesha holds, supports and guides all other chakras, thereby "governing the forces that propel the <a href="wheel%20of%20life">wheel of life</a>".

Though Ganesha is popularly held to be the son of <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> and <a href="Parvati">Parvati</a>, the <a href="Puranas">Puranic</a> myths give different versions about his birth. In some he was created by Parvati, in another he was created by Shiva "and" Parvati, in another he appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati or he was born from the elephant headed goddess Malini after she drank Parvati's bath water that had been thrown in the river.

The family includes his brother, the god of war, <a href="Kartikeya">Kartikeya</a>, who is also called Skanda and Murugan. Regional differences dictate the order of their births. In northern India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder, while in the south, Ganesha is considered the firstborn. In <a href="North%20India">northern India</a>, Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, after which worship of him declined significantly. As Skanda fell, Ganesha rose. Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers and may reflect sectarian tensions.

Ganesha's marital status, the subject of considerable scholarly review, varies widely in mythological stories. One lesser-known and unpopular pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried "<a href="Brahmacharya">brahmachari</a>". This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India. Another popularly-accepted mainstream pattern associates him with the concepts of "Buddhi" (intellect), "Siddhi" (spiritual power), and "Riddhi" (prosperity); these qualities are personified as goddesses, said to be Ganesha's wives. He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: '). Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, <a href="Sarasvati">Sarasvati</a> or (particularly in <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>). He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity, <a href="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a>. Another pattern, mainly prevalent in the <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> region, links Ganesha with the banana tree, <a href="Kala%20Bo">Kala Bo</a>.

The "<a href="Shiva%20Purana">Shiva Purana</a>" says that Ganesha had begotten two sons: (prosperity) and (profit). In northern Indian variants of this story, the sons are often said to be (auspiciouness) and . The 1975 <a href="Hindi%20film">Hindi film</a> "<a href="Jai%20Santoshi%20Maa">Jai Santoshi Maa</a>" shows Ganesha married to Riddhi and Siddhi and having a daughter named <a href="Santoshi%20Mata">Santoshi Ma</a>, the goddess of satisfaction. This story has no Puranic basis, but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma's cult as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.

Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions, especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business. K.N. Somayaji says, "there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati. ... Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country". Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity.

Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity. Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies. Dancers and musicians, particularly in southern India, begin art performances such as the <a href="Bharatnatyam">Bharatnatyam</a> dance with a prayer to Ganesha. <a href="Mantra">Mantra</a>s such as "Om Shri Namah" (Om, salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha) are often used. One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is "Om Ganapataye Namah" (Om, , Salutation to the Lord of Hosts).

Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as <a href="modak">modak</a>a and small sweet balls called <a href="laddu">laddu</a>s. He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets, called a "". Because of his identification with the color red, he is often worshipped with <a href="red%20sandalwood">red sandalwood</a> paste () or red flowers. grass ("<a href="Cynodon%20dactylon">Cynodon dactylon</a>") and other materials are also used in his worship.

Festivals associated with Ganesh are Ganesh Chaturthi or Vināyaka chaturthī in the "<a href="paksha"></a>" (the fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of "<a href="Bhadrapada">Bhadrapada</a>" (August/September) and the <a href="Ganesh%20Jayanti">Ganesh Jayanti</a> (Ganesha's birthday) celebrated on the "cathurthī" of the "" (fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of "<a href="Maagha">magha</a>" (January/February)."

An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days, starting on <a href="Ganesha%20Chaturthi">Ganesha Chaturthi</a>, which typically falls in late August or early September. The festival begins with people bringing in clay idols of Ganesha, symbolising the god's visit. The festival culminates on the day of <a href="Ananta%20Chaturdashi">Ananta Chaturdashi</a>, when the idols ("<a href="murti">murti</a>s") are immersed in the most convenient body of water. Some families have a tradition of immersion on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 7th day. In 1893, <a href="Lokmanya%20Tilak">Lokmanya Tilak</a> transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event. He did so "to bridge the gap between the <a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a> and the non-Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them" in his nationalistic strivings against the British in <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. Because of Ganesha's wide appeal as "the god for Everyman", Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule. Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in <a href="Pandal">pavilions</a>, and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day.
Today, Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour, though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra. The festival also assumes huge proportions in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples.

In Hindu temples, Ganesha is depicted in various ways: as a subordinate deity ('); as a deity related to the principal deity ('); or as the principal deity of the temple (). As the god of transitions, he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to keep out the unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati’s doorkeeper. In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: अष्टविनायक; ; lit. "eight Ganesha (shrines)") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius of the city of <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore. The eight shrines are: <a href="Morgaon%20Ganesha%20Temple">Morgaon</a>, <a href="Siddhivinayak%20Temple%2C%20Siddhatek">Siddhatek</a>, <a href="Ballaleshwar%20Pali">Pali</a>, <a href="Varadvinayak">Mahad</a>, <a href="Chintamani%20Temple%2C%20Theur">Theur</a>, <a href="Lenyadri">Lenyadri</a>, <a href="Vigneshwara%20Temple%2C%20Ozar">Ozar</a> and <a href="Ranjangaon%20Ganpati">Ranjangaon</a>.

There are many other important Ganesha temples at the following locations: <a href="Wai%2C%20Maharashtra">Wai</a> in Maharashtra; <a href="Chintaman%20Ganesh%20temple%2C%20Ujjain">Ujjain</a> in <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>; <a href="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a>, <a href="Nagaur">Nagaur</a> and Raipur (<a href="Pali%2C%20Rajasthan">Pali</a>) in <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>; Baidyanath in <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>; <a href="Baroda">Baroda</a>, Dholaka, and <a href="Valsad">Valsad</a> in <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and Dhundiraj Temple in <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>. Prominent Ganesha temples in southern India include the following: the <a href="Rockfort%20Ucchi%20Pillayar%20Temple">Rockfort Ucchi Pillayar Temple</a> at <a href="Tiruchirapalli">Tiruchirapalli</a> in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>; <a href="Kottarakkara%20Sree%20Mahaganapathi%20Kshethram">Kottarakkara</a>, <a href="Trivandrum">Pazhavangadi</a>, <a href="Madhur%20Temple">Kasargod</a> in <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>; <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a>, and <a href="Ganesha%20Temple%2C%20Idagunji">Idagunji</a> in <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>; and <a href="Bhadrachalam">Bhadrachalam</a> in <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a>.

T. A. Gopinatha notes, "Every village however small has its own image of ' (Vigneshvara) with or without a temple to house it in. At entrances of villages and forts, below ' (<a href="Sacred%20fig">Sacred fig</a>) trees ... in a niche ... in temples of ' (Vishnu) as well as ' (Shiva) and also in separate shrines specially constructed in ' temples ... the figure of ' is invariably seen." Ganesha temples have also been built outside of India, including <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> (including the four "Vinayaka" shrines in the <a href="Kathmandu%20valley">Kathmandu valley</a>), and in several western countries.

Ganesha appeared in his classic form as a clearly-recognizable deity with well-defined iconographic attributes in the early 4th to 5th centuries CE. Some of the earliest known Ganesha images include two images found in eastern Afghanistan. The first image was discovered in the ruins north of <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> along with those of <a href="Surya">Surya</a> and <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>. It is dated to the 4th-century. The second image found in <a href="Gardez">Gardez</a> has an inscription on Ganesha pedestal that has helped date it to the 5th-century. Another Ganesha sculpture is embedded in the walls of Cave 6 of the <a href="Udayagiri%20Caves">Udayagiri Caves</a> in <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>. This is dated to the 5th-century. An early iconic image of Ganesha with elephant head, a bowl of sweets and a goddess sitting in his lap has been found in the ruins of the <a href="Bhumara%20Temple">Bhumara Temple</a> in Madhya Pradesh, and this is dated to the 5th-century <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta period</a>. Other recent discoveries, such as one from Ramgarh Hill, are also dated to the 4th or 5th centuries. An independent cult with Ganesha as the primary deity was well established by about the 10th century. Narain summarizes the lack of evidence about Ganesha's history before the 5th century as follows:

The evidence for more ancient Ganesha, suggests Narain, may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions, or outside geocultural boundaries of India. Ganesha appears in <a href="China">China</a> by the 6th century, states Brown, and his artistic images in temple setting as "remover of obstacles" in South Asia appear by about 400 CE. He is, states Bailey, recognized as goddess Parvati's son and integrated into <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a> theology by early centuries of the common era.

Courtright reviews various speculative theories about the early history of Ganesha, including supposed tribal traditions and animal cults, and dismisses all of them in this way:
Thapan's book on the development of Ganesha devotes a chapter to speculations about the role elephants had in early India but concludes that "although by the second century CE the elephant-headed "" form exists it cannot be presumed to represent . There is no evidence of a deity by this name having an elephant or elephant-headed form at this early stage. had yet to make his debut."

Some have noted the roots of Ganesha worship, dating back to 3,000 BCE since the times of <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>. In 1993, a metal plate depiction of an elephant-headed figure, interpreted as Ganesha, was discovered in <a href="Lorestan%20Province">Lorestan Province</a>, Iran, dating back to 1,200 BCE. First <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> images of Ganesha are from 1st century CE found in Ter, Pal, Verrapuram, and Chandraketugarh. These figures are small, with elephant head, two arms, and chubby physique. The earliest Ganesha icons in stone were carved in Mathura during Kushan times (2nd–3rd centuries CE).

One theory of the origin of Ganesha is that he gradually came to prominence in connection with the four <a href="Vinayakas">Vinayakas</a> (). In <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>, the were a group of four troublesome demons who created obstacles and difficulties but who were easily propitiated. The name Vināyaka is a common name for Ganesha both in the and in Buddhist Tantras. Krishan is one of the academics who accept this view, stating flatly of Ganesha, "He is a non-Vedic god. His origin is to be traced to the four Vināyakas, evil spirits, of the "Mānavagŗhyasūtra" (7th–4th century BCE) who cause various types of evil and suffering". Depictions of elephant-headed human figures, which some identify with Ganesha, appear in <a href="Indian%20art">Indian art</a> and <a href="Indian%20coinage">coinage</a> as early as the 2nd century. According to Ellawala, the elephant-headed Ganesha as lord of the Ganas was known to the people of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> in the early pre-Christian era.

The title "Leader of the group" (Sanskrit: ') occurs twice in the "<a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a>", but in neither case does it refer to the modern Ganesha. The term appears in RV 2.23.1 as a title for <a href="Brahmanaspati">Brahmanaspati</a>, according to commentators. While this verse doubtless refers to Brahmanaspati, it was later adopted for worship of Ganesha and is still used today. In rejecting any claim that this passage is evidence of Ganesha in the "Rig Veda", Ludo Rocher says that it "clearly refers to —who is the deity of the hymn—and only". Equally clearly, the second passage (<a href="Mandala%2010">RV 10</a>.112.9) refers to <a href="Indra">Indra</a>, who is given the epithet ", translated "Lord of the companies (of the "Maruts")." However, Rocher notes that the more recent Ganapatya literature often quotes the Rigvedic verses to give Vedic respectability to Ganesha.

Two verses in texts belonging to <a href="Yajurveda">Black Yajurveda</a>, ' (2.9.1) and ' (10.1), appeal to a deity as "the tusked one" (), "elephant-faced" (Hastimukha), and "with a curved trunk" (). These names are suggestive of Ganesha, and the 14th century commentator <a href="Sayana">Sayana</a> explicitly establishes this identification. The description of Dantin, possessing a twisted trunk () and holding a corn-sheaf, a sugar cane, and a club, is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says "we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic Dantin". However, Krishan considers these hymns to be post-Vedic additions. Thapan reports that these passages are "generally considered to have been interpolated". Dhavalikar says, "the references to the elephant-headed deity in the ' have been proven to be very late interpolations, and thus are not very helpful for determining the early formation of the deity".

Ganesha does not appear in the <a href="Indian%20epic">Indian epic</a> literature that is dated to the <a href="Vedic%20civilization">Vedic period</a>. A late interpolation to the epic poem "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>" (1.1.75-79) says that the sage <a href="Vyasa">Vyasa</a> () asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the "Mahabharata", in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix. The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during preparation of the critical edition. Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for 's dictation of the "Mahabharata" in this interpolation. Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and <a href="Moriz%20Winternitz">Moriz Winternitz</a> concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the "Mahabharata" some 150 years later. Winternitz also notes that a distinctive feature in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>n manuscripts of the "Mahabharata" is their omission of this Ganesha legend. The term ' is found in some recensions of the ' and ' that are regarded as interpolations. A reference to "" ("Creator of Obstacles") in "Vanaparva" is also believed to be an interpolation and does not appear in the critical edition.

Stories about Ganesha often occur in the <a href="Puranas">Puranic</a> corpus. Brown notes while the Puranas "defy precise chronological ordering", the more detailed narratives of Ganesha's life are in the late texts, c. 600–1300. Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant's head are in the later Puranas, which were composed of c. 600 onwards. He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas, such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries.

In his survey of Ganesha's rise to prominence in <a href="Sanskrit%20literature">Sanskrit literature</a>, Ludo Rocher notes that:

Ganesha's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of <a href="Smartism">Smartism</a>. The 9th-century philosopher <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a> popularized the "worship of the five forms" (<a href="Panchayatana%20puja">Panchayatana puja</a>) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition. This worship practice invokes the five deities Ganesha, <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, Shiva, <a href="Devi">Devi</a>, and <a href="Surya">Surya</a>. Adi Shankara instituted the tradition primarily to unite the principal deities of these five major sects on an equal status. This formalized the role of Ganesha as a complementary deity.

Once Ganesha was accepted as one of the five principal deities of <a href="Brahminical%20Hinduism">Brahmanism</a>, some <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the <a href="Ganapatya">Ganapatya</a> tradition, as seen in the "Ganesha Purana" and the "Mudgala Purana".

The date of composition for the "Ganesha Purana" and the "Mudgala Purana"—and their dating relative to one another—has sparked academic debate. Both works were developed over time and contain age-layered strata. Anita Thapan reviews comment about dating and provide her own judgment. "It seems likely that the core of the Ganesha Purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries", she says, "but was later interpolated." Lawrence W. Preston considers the most reasonable date for the "Ganesha Purana" to be between 1100 and 1400, which coincides with the apparent age of the sacred sites mentioned by the text.

R.C. Hazra suggests that the "Mudgala Purana" is older than the "Ganesha Purana", which he dates between 1100 and 1400. However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the "Mudgala Purana" was the last of the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the "Mudgala Purana" specifically mentions the "Ganesha Purana" as one of the four Puranas (the "Brahma", the "Brahmanda", the "Ganesha", and the "Mudgala" Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha. While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions. Another highly regarded scripture, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries.

"<a href="Ganesha%20Sahasranama">Ganesha Sahasranama</a>" is part of the Puranic literature, and is a litany of a thousand names and attributes of Ganesha. Each name in the <a href="sahasranama">sahasranama</a> conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha. Versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama are found in the "<a href="Ganesha%20Purana">Ganesha Purana</a>".

One of the most important Sanskrit texts, that enjoys authority in "Ganapatya" tradition states John Grimes, is the "Ganapati Atharvashirsa".

Commercial and cultural contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands.

Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures. From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders. The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community.
Hindus migrated to <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a> and took their culture, including Ganesha, with them. Statues of Ganesha are found throughout the region, often beside Shiva sanctuaries. The forms of Ganesha found in the Hindu art of <a href="Java">Java</a>, <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, and <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> show specific regional influences. The spread of Hindu culture throughout Southeast Asia established Ganesha worship in modified forms in Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand. In <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>, Hinduism and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> were practiced side by side, and mutual influences can be seen in the iconography of Ganesha in the region. In Thailand, Cambodia, and among the Hindu classes of the <a href="Cham%20%28Asia%29">Chams</a> in Vietnam, Ganesha was mainly thought of as a remover of obstacles. Today in Buddhist Thailand, Ganesha is regarded as a remover of obstacles, the god of success.

Before the arrival of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, Afghanistan had close cultural ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region.

Ganesha appears in <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god , but also as a Hindu demon form with the same name. His image appears in Buddhist sculptures during the late Gupta period. As the Buddhist god , he is often shown dancing. This form, called Ganapati, was popular in northern India, later adopted in Nepal, and then in Tibet. In Nepal, the Hindu form of Ganesha, known as <a href="Heramba">Heramba</a>, is popular; he has five heads and rides a lion. Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent views of him. A Tibetan rendering of Ganapati is "tshogs bdag". In one Tibetan form, he is shown being trodden under foot by <a href="Mahakala"></a>,(Shiva) a popular Tibetan deity. Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, and sometimes dancing. Ganesha appears in China and Japan in forms that show distinct regional character. In <a href="North%20China">northern China</a>, the earliest known stone statue of Ganesha carries an inscription dated to 531. In Japan, where Ganesha is known as <a href="Kangiten">Kangiten</a>, the Ganesha cult was first mentioned in 806.
The canonical literature of <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> does not mention the worship of Ganesha. However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, for whom he appears to have taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, <a href="Kubera">Kubera</a>. Jain ties with the trading community support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections. The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century. A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.

2009 World Series

The 2009 World Series was the <a href="World%20Series">championship series</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s (MLB) <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2009 season</a>. As the 105th edition of the World Series, it was a <a href="best-of-seven%20playoff">best-of-seven playoff</a> contested between the <a href="2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, champions of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) and <a href="2008%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">defending World Series champions</a>, and the <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a>, champions of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL). The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, winning their 27th World Series championship. The series was played between October 28 and November 4, broadcast on <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Fox</a>, and watched by an average of roughly 19 million viewers. Due to the start of the season being pushed back by the <a href="2009%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">2009 World Baseball Classic</a> in March, this was the first World Series regularly scheduled to be played into the month of November. This series was a rematch of the <a href="1950%20World%20Series">1950 World Series</a>.

<a href="Home%20advantage">Home field advantage</a> for the Series went to the AL for the eighth straight year as a result of its 4–3 win in the <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a>. The Phillies earned their berth into the <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season%23Postseason">playoffs</a> by winning the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a>. The Yankees won the <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> to earn their berth, posting the best record in the Major Leagues. The Phillies reached the World Series by defeating the <a href="2009%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">Colorado Rockies</a> in the best-of-five <a href="2009%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a>, and the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in the best-of-seven <a href="2009%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NL Championship Series</a> (NLCS). The Yankees defeated the <a href="2009%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Minnesota Twins</a> in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> and the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a> in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">AL Championship Series</a> (ALCS) to advance to their first World Series since <a href="2003%20World%20Series">2003</a>. As a result of their loss, the Phillies became the first team since the Yankees to lose the World Series after winning it the previous year.

<a href="Cliff%20Lee">Cliff Lee</a> pitched a <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> in the Phillies' Game 1 victory, allowing only one <a href="Earned%20run%23Unearned%20run">unearned run</a>, while <a href="Chase%20Utley">Chase Utley</a> hit two home runs. In Game 2, solo <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s by <a href="Mark%20Teixeira">Mark Teixeira</a> and <a href="Hideki%20Matsui">Hideki Matsui</a> helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a <a href="rain%20delay">rain delay</a>ed start, Game 3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> en route to a Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game 4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert <a href="base%20running">base running</a> play by <a href="Johnny%20Damon">Johnny Damon</a>. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game 5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player</a> (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> to win the award; Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position is not used in NL ballparks.

Several records were tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, including team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins (<a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a> with 18), career World Series <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">saves</a> (<a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> with 11), home runs in a World Series (Utley with five), <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s by a hitter in a World Series (<a href="Ryan%20Howard">Ryan Howard</a> with 13), and <a href="run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> in a single World Series game (Matsui with six).

During the off-season, the Phillies promoted assistant general manager <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Amaro%2C%20Jr.">Rubén Amaro, Jr.</a> to <a href="General%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a>, succeeding <a href="Pat%20Gillick">Pat Gillick</a> who retired at the end of a three-year contract. Their most notable offseason player change was in <a href="left%20field">left field</a>, as <a href="Pat%20Burrell">Pat Burrell</a> departed due to <a href="Free%20agent">free agency</a> and was replaced by free agent <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Iba%C3%B1ez">Raúl Ibañez</a>. Another notable acquisition was free agent <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Chan%20Ho%20Park">Chan Ho Park</a>. Park was originally signed as a backup option for the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>, as <a href="relief%20pitcher">reliever</a> <a href="J.%20C.%20Romero">J. C. Romero</a> was assigned a 50-game suspension after violating the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20drug%20policy">Major League Baseball drug policy</a>, but Park won the fifth <a href="Starting%20pitcher">starter</a>'s job in <a href="Spring%20Training">Spring Training</a>.

In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated pitcher <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a> in two simulated games against the <a href="Dominican%20Summer%20Phillies">Phillies DSL team</a>, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Replacing <a href="Jamie%20Moyer">Jamie Moyer</a> as a starter in the Phillies rotation on August 12, 2009, Philadelphia won each of Martínez's first seven starts, the first time in franchise history that this had occurred with any debuting Phillies pitcher. The Phillies made one large acquisition at the <a href="trade%20deadline">trade deadline</a>, trading four minor league players to the <a href="2009%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> for pitcher <a href="Cliff%20Lee">Cliff Lee</a> and <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Ben%20Francisco">Ben Francisco</a>. Lee won seven of his twelve regular season starts for Philadelphia in 2009.

During the regular season, the Phillies led the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> for most of the year, taking first place for good on May 30. Ibáñez had started the year strongly, <a href="Batting%20average">batting</a> well over .300 with 17 <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s and 46 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBI) in the first two months of the season, which led the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" to call him an "early <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP</a> candidate". He was placed on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> in mid-June for a groin injury, however, and though he returned he did not bat above .260 for any other month that season. Although Ibáñez did not receive MVP votes his teammates <a href="Ryan%20Howard">Ryan Howard</a> and <a href="Chase%20Utley">Chase Utley</a> had successful years, finishing 3rd and 8th in the balloting respectively. The Phillies finished the season with a record of 93–69 (.574), six games above the second-place <a href="2009%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> in their division.

The Phillies defeated the <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> <a href="2009%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">Colorado Rockies</a> in the <a href="2009%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a> (NLDS), three games to one, advancing to the <a href="2009%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League Championship Series</a> (NLCS). Facing the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, the Phillies won the NLCS, four games to one, becoming the first team to repeat as <a href="National%20League">National League</a> champions since the <a href="1995%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">1995</a>–<a href="1996%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">96</a> <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>. Ryan Howard won the <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NLCS MVP</a> for his strong offensive performance during the series. Howard tied <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>'s postseason record by having at least one <a href="Run%20batted%20in">RBI</a> in eight straight games across the NLDS and NLCS. They became the first World Series champion to return to the World Series the following year since the <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2000</a>–<a href="2001%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">01 New York Yankees</a>.

The Yankees' offseason began in November 2008 with control over their organization shifting from long-time owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> to his son <a href="Hal%20Steinbrenner">Hal Steinbrenner</a>. Notable player departures included <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a>—who announced his retirement on November 20, 2008—as well as <a href="Bobby%20Abreu">Bobby Abreu</a>, <a href="Jason%20Giambi">Jason Giambi</a>, and <a href="Carl%20Pavano">Carl Pavano</a>, who all left as free agents. Notable free agent acquisitions included starting pitchers <a href="CC%20Sabathia">CC Sabathia</a> and <a href="A.%20J.%20Burnett">A. J. Burnett</a>, and <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Mark%20Teixeira">Mark Teixeira</a>. Another major addition was outfielder <a href="Nick%20Swisher">Nick Swisher</a>, acquired in a trade with the <a href="2008%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a>.

The Yankees played the 2009 season in <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>, their first year in that park after playing for 84 years in <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">"Old" Yankee Stadium</a>. They won the <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> with an eight-game lead over <a href="Yankees%20%E2%80%93%20Red%20Sox%20rivalry">their rivals</a>, the <a href="2009%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a>, compiling a record of 103–59. Sabathia won 19 games and position players <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> and Teixeira both had strong seasons offensively, Rodriguez with 30 home runs and 100 RBI and Teixeira with 39 and 122 respectively. <a href="Closer%20%28baseball%29">Closing pitcher</a> <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> earned his 500th <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">save</a> against the Yankees' <a href="Mets%E2%80%93Yankees%20rivalry">cross-town rival</a> <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a>, becoming the second pitcher in history to do so. On September 11, 2009, <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> recorded his 2,722nd career hit, passing Lou Gehrig to become the all-time leader in career hits recorded as a Yankee.

The Yankees defeated the <a href="2009%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Minnesota Twins</a> in three games in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> and the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a> in six games in the <a href="2009%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> (ALCS) to win their first <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">American League pennant</a> since 2003. Sabathia was named <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP</a> of the ALCS with two wins in the series. The Yankees' victory in the ALCS earned them their 40th World Series appearance in franchise history, and their first since losing to the <a href="2003%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> in .

The two teams played a three-game <a href="Interleague%20play">interleague</a> series at Yankee Stadium in May 2009, with the Phillies winning two of the three games. The series included two <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">blown saves</a> by Phillies' <a href="Closing%20pitcher">closer</a> <a href="Brad%20Lidge">Brad Lidge</a> in games 2 and 3, although the Phillies came back to win the final game in <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a>.

The Yankees had <a href="Home%20advantage">home field advantage</a> for the Series as the American League had won <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">that year's All-Star Game</a>. The team match-up was heavily discussed and analyzed in the media, per the east coast bias, prior to the beginning of the series. Both teams' offensive lineups were heavily touted, with the Yankees and Phillies leading their respective leagues in <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs scored</a> per game. Yankees <a href="third%20base">third base</a>man Alex Rodriguez drew particular focus in the media for his success in earlier rounds of the 2009 playoffs in contrast to past postseason performances. The two lineups featured twenty former <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Stars</a> and three former MVP award winners. Only one regular starter between both teams, Phillies <a href="catcher">catcher</a> <a href="Carlos%20Ruiz%20%28baseball%29">Carlos Ruiz</a>, did not have at least ten <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s during the 2009 regular season. The two teams combined for 468 home runs during the season, more than any pair of opponents in World Series history.

The pitching staffs were also the subject of significant discussion prior to the series. The starting pitchers for Game 1, CC Sabathia and Cliff Lee, were regarded as aces who dominated the 2009 postseason with a 0.96 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA) between them. This matchup was of particular note, as Sabathia and Lee were former teammates from the Cleveland Indians and each had won a <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> with that franchise. Yankees <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Joe%20Girardi">Joe Girardi</a> had been using a three-man <a href="starting%20rotation">starting rotation</a> during the playoffs, in contrast to the four-pitcher rotation used by the Phillies. This difference led "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" to give the Phillies' starting rotation the "edge" in the series, as the World Series had one fewer day off than previous rounds of the playoffs, making the series less conducive to using a three-man rotation. <a href="Gene%20Wojciechowski">Gene Wojciechowski</a> of <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> criticized Girardi's strategy, arguing that <a href="Chad%20Gaudin">Chad Gaudin</a> should have pitched in Game 5 or 6, instead of A. J. Burnett or <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a> on reduced, three days' rest. Wojciechowski argued that while Sabathia had proven his ability to pitch on shorter rest, Burnett and Pettitte should have been given their regular time between starts. Burnett had drawn some criticism, as he performed poorly in his last appearance before the World Series, a start in Game 5 of the ALCS in which he allowed six runs over six innings. However, Burnett had previously been successful on short rest, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest before this game. Some believed Girardi settled on a three-man rotation because he had limited options for a fourth starting pitcher, either Gaudin or <a href="Joba%20Chamberlain">Joba Chamberlain</a>, who had been inconsistent as starters in the regular season and had been shifted into the bullpen for the postseason.

The matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, also drew attention. Rivera and Lidge were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason, whereas closers on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 postseason games before the World Series in 2009. Both had performed well during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were in stark contrast to the previous season (41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games). As a result, "USA Today" gave the Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge had blown two saves against the Yankees during their regular season series earlier that year.

The Series started on October 28, 2009, which was the latest start in World Series history, beating the previous record held by the 2001 World Series (October 27). Game 4 was played on Sunday, November 1 and the series-winning Game 6 took place on November 4. The Series was only the third to end in a month other than October. The first came in , which was played entirely in September after the regular season was cut short due to World War I. The other such series was in when the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> caused a delay in the baseball season that eventually forced the end of the World Series into November.

Earlier in the season <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball%20%28MLB%29">Commissioner</a> <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a> expressed interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8 p.m. ET for the first time in 30 years, but no day games were played. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at <a href="Lincoln%20Financial%20Field">Lincoln Financial Field</a> on the day of Game 4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1 p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game 4. Similarly, Game 5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> hosted the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) at the <a href="Wells%20Fargo%20Center%20%28Philadelphia%29">Wachovia Center</a>. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7 p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5 p.m. to avoid conflict.

The <a href="Umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpires</a> for the series were <a href="Joe%20West%20%28umpire%29">Joe West</a>, <a href="Dana%20DeMuth">Dana DeMuth</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Davis%20%28umpire%29">Gerry Davis</a>, <a href="Brian%20Gorman">Brian Gorman</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Nelson%20%28umpire%29">Jeff Nelson</a>, and <a href="Mike%20Everitt%20%28baseball%29">Mike Everitt</a>. The World Series crew had included at least 1 umpire who had never worked the World Series in 24 of the past 25 series; however, following several mistakes by umpires in earlier rounds of the playoffs, this crew did not.

The Phillies had won the <a href="2008%20World%20Series">previous season's World Series</a> against the <a href="2008%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Rays</a> for the franchise's second championship. The Yankees had lost their previous World Series appearance to the <a href="2003%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> in and had not won since against the <a href="2000%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a>. This was the fifth Series played between teams from New York and Philadelphia, and was the first Yankees–Phillies matchup since . The series also was the fourth consecutive time that the Phillies would have faced a team from the current AL East in the World Series, while the Yankees had faced a NL East opponent in four of their five most recent World Series appearances.

This Series had two unofficial nicknames: "Turnpike Series", for the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Turnpike">New Jersey Turnpike</a>, which connects New York to Philadelphia through the state of New Jersey, and "Liberty Series", based on the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> in Philadelphia and the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> in New York.

The Phillies' Ryan Howard got the first hit of the 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded in the first and the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out <a href="home%20run">home run</a> by Chase Utley in the top of the third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by <a href="Phil%20Hughes">Phil Hughes</a>. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by <a href="D%C3%A1maso%20Marte">Dámaso Marte</a>. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by <a href="David%20Robertson%20%28baseball%29">David Robertson</a>, who walked <a href="Jayson%20Werth">Jayson Werth</a> and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by <a href="Shane%20Victorino">Shane Victorino</a> and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.

Lee's pitching performance made history in several ways:

Prior to the game, <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> and <a href="Alicia%20Keys">Alicia Keys</a> performed the song "<a href="Empire%20State%20of%20Mind">Empire State of Mind</a>" for the Yankee Stadium crowd. This game marked the first postseason appearance of <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a> against the Yankees since the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2004 American League Championship Series</a>, when he was with the <a href="2004%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a> and a part of the two teams' <a href="Yankees%20%E2%80%93%20Red%20Sox%20rivalry">long standing rivalry</a>; it was also the second-ever World Series start that Martínez made. There was much media interest in Martínez's "return to Yankee Stadium" for Game 2, as he told reporters at a pre-game press conference "When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, waiting for you to throw the ball, you have to consider yourself someone special, someone that really has a purpose out there."

The Phillies scored first for the second game in a row, with Raúl Ibañez hitting a <a href="ground%20rule%20double">ground rule double</a> and then scoring on a <a href="Matt%20Stairs">Matt Stairs</a> RBI single off <a href="A.%20J.%20Burnett">A. J. Burnett</a> in the second inning.

Mark Teixeira tied the game with a home run in the fourth inning, and <a href="Hideki%20Matsui">Hideki Matsui</a> broke the tie in the sixth with another homer. Martínez departed the game after giving up consecutive hits to <a href="Jerry%20Hairston%2C%20Jr.">Jerry Hairston, Jr.</a> and <a href="Melky%20Cabrera">Melky Cabrera</a> to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, <a href="Johnny%20Damon">Johnny Damon</a> hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire <a href="Brian%20Gorman">Brian Gorman</a> ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air; thus, the result was an inning-ending double play. Both Posada and Joe Girardi vehemently protested the call, claiming that the batted ball had hit the ground before being caught; however, the umpires did not reverse the call. ESPN reported that Gorman blew the call. This was the first of two calls made by Gorman in Game Two that were heavily criticized.

Burnett left the game after seven innings, having given up one run. He was replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth inning. With one out in the eighth, the Phillies put two runners on with a walk to <a href="Jimmy%20Rollins">Jimmy Rollins</a> and a single by Shane Victorino. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base. The play was the second disputed call made by umpire Brian Gorman in Game Two. Gorman himself later admitted he missed this call, saying, "on a freeze frame, it looks like there's a little bit of a ball outside [Teixeira's] glove when [Utley] hits the bag." Ultimately, Rivera threw 39 pitches and got six outs for his 38th postseason save, his tenth in World Series play. 

The start of the game was postponed 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17 p.m. The cast of the television series "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>" (with <a href="Amber%20Riley">Amber Riley</a> singing lead) performed the <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a> as part of a ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> to make the score 3–0 in the bottom of the second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double so Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using <a href="MLB%20instant%20replay">MLB instant replay</a>, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, so the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game 4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.

<a href="Nick%20Swisher">Nick Swisher</a> opened the top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by Andy Pettitte. This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since <a href="Jim%20Bouton">Jim Bouton</a> in <a href="1964%20World%20Series">1964</a>. Derek Jeter followed Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. <a href="Cole%20Hamels">Cole Hamels</a> then walked Teixeira and was relieved by <a href="J.%20A.%20Happ">J. A. Happ</a>. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but <a href="Nick%20Swisher">Nick Swisher</a> added to the Yankees lead with a home run off of him in the sixth. Werth hit his second home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.

<a href="Chad%20Durbin">Chad Durbin</a> relieved Happ in the top of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, who then <a href="Stolen%20base">stole</a> second base. Rodriguez was then <a href="Hit%20by%20pitch">hit by a pitch</a>, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte in the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. <a href="Brett%20Myers">Brett Myers</a> retired the first two batters in the top of the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a home run <a href="Pinch%20hitter">pinch hitting</a> for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in the bottom of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to <a href="Carlos%20Ruiz%20%28baseball%29">Carlos Ruiz</a> before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.

Prior to the start of the game, Derek Jeter and <a href="Albert%20Pujols">Albert Pujols</a> were named winners of the <a href="Hank%20Aaron%20Award">Hank Aaron Award</a> for their offensive performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man <a href="starting%20rotation">starting rotation</a>, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira ground out and Alex Rodriguez was <a href="Hit%20by%20pitch">hit by a pitch</a>. Rodriguez was hit twice the night before and the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a>. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia <a href="Intentional%20walk">intentionally walked</a> Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, <a href="Stolen%20base">stole</a> second, and scored on a single by <a href="Pedro%20Feliz">Pedro Feliz</a>. Although the run counted, <a href="instant%20replay">instant replay</a> of Howard's slide later showed that he did not touch <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a>.

Nick Swisher walked to lead off the fifth inning and advanced to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. <a href="Brett%20Gardner">Brett Gardner</a> replaced Cabrera in center field as a <a href="defensive%20substitution">defensive substitution</a> in the bottom of the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter <a href="Joe%20Blanton">Joe Blanton</a> in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third <a href="home%20run">home run</a> of the series in the bottom of the seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.

<a href="Ryan%20Madson">Ryan Madson</a> relieved Park in the eighth and allowed a walk and a single but held the Yankees scoreless. Joba Chamberlain replaced Marte in the bottom of the inning. He struck out the first two batters he faced but allowed a game-tying home run to Feliz before closing the inning.

Brad Lidge came into the game for the ninth inning, popping out Matsui and striking out Jeter before surrendering a two-out single to Damon—after a nine-pitch at bat with two strikes and four foul balls. Then, with Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and, on the same play, also stole third as the base was uncovered due to a <a href="Baseball%20positioning">defensive shift</a> against Teixeira. Several news outlets referred to this as a "mad dash", which Mike Vaccaro of the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" compared to <a href="Enos%20Slaughter">Enos Slaughter</a>'s <a href="Slaughter%27s%20Mad%20Dash">"Mad Dash"</a> in the <a href="1946%20World%20Series">1946 World Series</a>. Some believed that Damon's play caused Lidge to avoid throwing his best pitch—a <a href="slider">slider</a> with sharp downward movement—for the rest of the inning, as it risked a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a> that would have allowed Damon to score from third base. Teixeira was then hit by a pitch and Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single that scored Teixeira and Rodriguez, but was thrown out at second to end the inning. Mariano Rivera entered in the bottom of the ninth and <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">saved</a> the game for the Yankees on eight pitches for his second save of the series.

The Yankees replaced Melky Cabrera on their postseason roster with <a href="Ramiro%20Pe%C3%B1a">Ramiro Peña</a> due to his injury in Game 4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in <a href="center%20fielder">center field</a>. A. J. Burnett, the Yankees' Game 2 starter, started Game 5 on three days rest, one less than the Phillies' Cliff Lee. The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded in the bottom of the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being <a href="Hit%20by%20pitch">hit by a pitch</a>, and finally a three-run <a href="home%20run">home run</a> by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by <a href="runs%20batted%20in">RBI</a> singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz ground out.

Robertson held the Phillies scoreless for a second inning in the fourth. Jorge Posada entered as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> in the fifth inning for <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Molina%20%28baseball%29">José Molina</a> and grounded out. <a href="Eric%20Hinske">Eric Hinske</a> then pinch hit for Robertson and walked, advanced to third on a <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> single, and scored on a ground out by Damon. <a href="Alfredo%20Aceves">Alfredo Aceves</a> entered as the new Yankee pitcher in the bottom of the fifth. The first batter he faced, Jayson Werth, hit a deep drive to center field but it was caught for an out by Gardner, who collided with the outfield wall to complete the play. Aceves completed the inning without a run scoring, inducing ground outs from Ibáñez and Ruiz. <a href="Phil%20Coke">Phil Coke</a> relieved Aceves in the seventh inning and allowed two Phillies players to tie World Series records. First, Utley tied <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>'s record for most home runs in a World Series with a home run, his fifth of the series. Coke then <a href="Strikeout">struck out</a> Howard, Howard's 12th strikeout in the series, tying <a href="Willie%20Wilson%20%28baseball%29">Willie Wilson</a>'s record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Finally, Coke was driven from the game after allowing another home run, this time to Ibáñez, and was relieved by Phil Hughes.

Victorino was <a href="Defensive%20substitution">replaced defensively</a> in the eighth inning by <a href="Ben%20Francisco">Ben Francisco</a>. Lee was driven from the game after allowing a single to Damon, followed by a double by Mark Teixeira, and then a double by Rodriguez that scored both runners. Chan Ho Park relieved Lee and induced a ground out from Nick Swisher, which advanced Rodriguez to third base. Rodriguez scored on a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> by <a href="Robinson%20Can%C3%B3">Robinson Canó</a>. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing a double to Posada and a single to Hideki Matsui without recording an out. Batting with men on first and third base, Jeter grounded into a <a href="double%20play">double play</a>, allowing Posada to score but emptying the bases. Damon singled to bring Teixeira to bat as the potential tying run, but Madson struck him out to record his first World Series <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">save</a>. Members of the news media, such as <a href="Gene%20Wojciechowski">Gene Wojciechowski</a>, were critical of the three-man <a href="starting%20rotation">starting rotation</a> strategy following Game 3, and contended that Burnett's poor performance was caused by insufficient rest in between starts. However, Burnett had been successful up to this point in such situations, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest (less than the normal four days between starts) before this game.
This game was the first Game 6 in a World Series since the <a href="2003%20World%20Series">2003 World Series</a> six years earlier, the longest such gap in the history of the World Series. <a href="Mary%20J.%20Blige">Mary J. Blige</a>, a Bronx native, performed "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>". Andy Pettitte started on three days rest, the third straight game in which the Yankees fielded a pitcher on short rest. The Phillies started Pedro Martínez, who called himself and opposing pitcher <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a> "old goats" and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: "I know that they don't like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games."

The Yankees scored first with an Alex Rodriguez walk opening the bottom of the second inning followed by a two-run home run by <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a <a href="Triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a> by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> from Jimmy Rollins in the top of the third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the <a href="bases%20loaded">bases loaded</a> in the bottom of the third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was <a href="Defensive%20substitution">replaced defensively</a> in the top of the fourth by <a href="Jerry%20Hairston%2C%20Jr.">Jerry Hairston, Jr.</a>
Phillies starter Pedro Martínez was removed after allowing four runs in four innings, relieved in the fifth by Chad Durbin. Durbin allowed a <a href="ground%20rule%20double">ground rule double</a> to Jeter, who advanced to third on a <a href="sacrifice%20bunt">sacrifice bunt</a> by Hairston and scored on a single by Mark Teixeira. Durbin then hit Rodriguez with a pitch and was relieved by J. A. Happ after recording just one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth <a href="Runs%20batted%20in">RBI</a> of the game, which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by <a href="Bobby%20Richardson">Bobby Richardson</a> in the <a href="1960%20World%20Series">1960 World Series</a>.

The Phillies made the game closer in the top of the sixth inning, as Chase Utley drew a walk and Ryan Howard followed him with a two-run home run, bringing the score to 7–3. After Raúl Ibañez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Andy Pettitte and closed the sixth without allowing the Phillies to score. Chan Ho Park came in for Happ, ending any Yankees threat that inning. Chamberlain was relieved by Dámaso Marte in the top of the seventh after allowing two baserunners, but Marte struck out Utley to end the inning scoreless. After Park allowed a single to Rodriguez, <a href="Scott%20Eyre">Scott Eyre</a> replaced him. Eyre allowed Rodriguez to steal second and <a href="Intentional%20walk">intentionally walked</a> Jorge Posada but escaped the inning without allowing a run.

Marte recorded one out, a strikeout of Howard, in the top of the eighth inning. With it Howard set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by a hitter in a single series with a total of 13. After the out, Marte was relieved by Yankees <a href="Closing%20pitcher">closer</a> Mariano Rivera in a non-<a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">save</a> situation. Rivera allowed a double to Ibáñez, but no runs, in the eighth. After retiring the first two batters in the eighth, Eyre gave way to Ryan Madson, who allowed a single to Jeter before ending the bottom of the eighth inning. Matt Stairs led off the ninth as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a>, but lined out. Ruiz worked a walk from Rivera, but successive outs by Rollins and Victorino ended the game 7–3 to clinch the World Series for the Yankees. Pettitte added to his own record for most playoff wins, bringing his career total to 18.
For the tenth consecutive year in the United States, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Fox Sports</a> televised the Series. <a href="Joe%20Buck">Joe Buck</a> called <a href="sports%20commentary">play-by-play</a> and <a href="Tim%20McCarver">Tim McCarver</a> provided <a href="Color%20commentator">analysis</a>. The Series was also broadcast on <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20ESPN%20Radio">ESPN Radio</a>, with <a href="Jon%20Miller">Jon Miller</a> and <a href="Joe%20Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> calling the action. <a href="Fox%20Sports%20en%20Espa%C3%B1ol">Fox Sports en Español</a> also broadcast the Series for the US <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>-speaking audience. The <a href="flagship%20station">flagship</a> radio stations of the respective teams broadcast all Series games with their local announcers. In Philadelphia, <a href="WPHT">WPHT</a> carried the Phillies' English-language broadcasts, with <a href="Scott%20Franzke">Scott Franzke</a>, <a href="Larry%20Andersen">Larry Andersen</a>, <a href="Tom%20McCarthy%20%28broadcaster%29">Tom McCarthy</a>, <a href="Gary%20Matthews">Gary Matthews</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Wheeler">Chris Wheeler</a> announcing, while <a href="WDAS%20%28AM%29">WUBA</a> aired the team's Spanish broadcasts. In New York, <a href="WCBS-AM">WCBS-AM</a> carried the Yankees' English broadcasts with <a href="John%20Sterling%20%28sportscaster%29">John Sterling</a> and <a href="Suzyn%20Waldman">Suzyn Waldman</a> announcing. This broadcast made Waldman the first woman to announce a World Series game on radio. <a href="XM%20Satellite%20Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> offered multiple feeds of each game to its subscribers.

Television ratings for the 2009 World Series were excellent. Game 1 attracted 19.5 million viewers, second only to the opening of the <a href="2004%20World%20Series">2004 World Series</a> for a series opener since 2000 and 29% higher than 2008's opening game. Game 4 produced the highest total viewership of the series with 22.8 million viewers, the highest for any World Series game since 2004 and the highest for a "non-decisive Game 4" since 2001. At 11.7 overall, the 2009 World Series was at the time the highest rated World Series since 2004 and the one of the only World Series to average double digits since 2007, the other being the <a href="2016%20World%20Series">2016 World Series</a>.

Many players with both teams won awards for their performances during the 2009 season. Teixeira and Jeter each won a <a href="Rawlings%20Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove</a> and <a href="Silver%20Slugger%20Award">Silver Slugger Award</a>; Jimmy Rollins and Shane Victorino won Gold Gloves, as well; and Chase Utley won a Silver Slugger Award. Rivera was named the 2009 <a href="DHL%20Delivery%20Man%20of%20the%20Year">DHL Delivery Man of the Year</a>, as well as "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>" <a href="Sporting%20News%23Pro%20Athlete%20of%20the%20Year">Pro Athlete of the Year</a>. Along with the <a href="Hank%20Aaron%20Award">Hank Aaron Award</a> announced before Game 4, Jeter won the <a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Award">Roberto Clemente Award</a> and was named "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>"s <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a> for 2009. Matsui won the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP</a> for his play, becoming the first Japanese player and first full-time <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> to win the award. Several items related to the series were sent to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum</a> including bats from Jeter and Matsui; caps from Rivera, Lee, and Pettitte; and Johnny Damon's <a href="Cleat%20%28shoe%29">cleats</a>.

Matsui also joined <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> radio analyst <a href="Dan%20Gladden">Dan Gladden</a> as members from the <a href="1994%20Japan%20Series">1994 world championship</a> <a href="Yomiuri%20Giants">Yomiuri Giants</a> team as players who have won championships in North America and Japan.

The series win brought the Yankees' franchise championship total to 27, more than any other North American professional sports franchise. This championship came in the Yankees' first year in their new stadium. They had also won the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">1923 World Series</a>, the opening year of the previous Yankee Stadium. The victory was noted by some sportswriters as a personal success for Alex Rodriguez, winning his first championship and succeeding in the playoffs where some had previously claimed he was a "choker and a loser". Prior to this series, Rodriguez had appeared in 2,166 regular season games without a World Series appearance, then the second-most among active players to <a href="Ken%20Griffey%2C%20Jr.">Ken Griffey, Jr.</a>

The Yankees' victory was credited to a number of different sources. Many players drew praise for their performances, including Series MVP Hideki Matsui; free agents signed the previous offseason including Mark Teixeira, CC Sabathia, and A. J. Burnett; and the so-called "<a href="Core%20Four">Core Four</a>" of Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, and Jorge Posada, who had all played a large role in the Yankees' past success in the 1990s. Manager Joe Girardi was also credited for his management of the team, particularly in his decision to use only three starting pitchers in the Yankees postseason <a href="starting%20rotation">starting rotation</a>. The Yankees were the first team to use only three starters in a World Series since the <a href="1998%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">San Diego Padres</a> in the <a href="1998%20World%20Series">1998 Series</a>.

Several members of the Yankees franchise dedicated the World Series in part to team owner George Steinbrenner, who had recently stepped back from his once prominent position with the team. Steinbrenner died on the day of the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a> the following season at the age of 80. On November 6, a victory parade took place for the Yankees in the "<a href="Canyon%20of%20Heroes">Canyon of Heroes</a>" in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York City. The Yankees sent a group of players, coach <a href="Tony%20Pe%C3%B1a">Tony Peña</a>, and team Senior Vice President <a href="Felix%20Lopez%20%28businessman%29">Felix Lopez</a> with the Commissioner's Trophy to the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> in early January 2010 to meet with President <a href="Leonel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Leonel Fernández</a>. Most of the 2009 Yankees received their <a href="championship%20rings">championship rings</a> on Opening Day the next season. Matsui was on the Angels in 2010 and when the Angels played their first series of the season in the Bronx, the Yankees home opener, they presented him with his ring. They also visited U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> in April 2010, presenting him with a signed jersey.

The Yankees returned to the playoffs the following season, as the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">wild card</a>. They lost to the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> in the <a href="2010%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2010 ALCS</a>; which included an 8-0 shutout in Yankee Stadium by former Phillie ace Cliff Lee; it was Lee's seventh straight postseason win which included three victories against the Yankees (two as a Phillie in the 2009 World Series, and in 2010 during the ALCS).

Following Game 4, after the Yankees took a 3–1 series lead, "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" accidentally printed a three-quarters-page <a href="Macy%27s">Macy's</a> advertisement congratulating the Phillies for winning the World Series, along with a picture of a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for the mistake.

Lee Jenkins of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" attributed Philadelphia's loss to a lack of pitching depth, noting that three different Yankees starters managed to win games in the series, while only Cliff Lee won games for the Phillies. The Phillies' 2008 postseason star pitchers, starter Cole Hamels and closer Brad Lidge, struggled in their only appearances of the 2009 World Series. The Phillies bullpen which did well in the NLCS performed poorly in the World Series, allowing seven runs in just 11 2/3 innings with a 5.40 ERA. Jorge Arangure Jr. of ESPN partially attributed the Phillies' loss to their lack of offensive production, citing the team's .227 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> in the World Series. Only Chase Utley performed well with 5 home runs and 22 of the Phillies' 90 bases, while Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins struggled at the plate, and Ryan Howard struck out a record 13 times in the World Series after his NLCS MVP performance.

Before the start of the 2010 season, the Phillies traded away their 2009 postseason ace pitcher Cliff Lee. The Phillies posted the league's best record in 2010, and returned to the playoffs where they lost to the eventual champions the <a href="2010%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a> in the <a href="2010%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a>.

Among those in attendance during Game 1 was <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="David%20Paterson">David Paterson</a>, whose party had five tickets behind home plate. On March 3, 2010, the New York Commission on Public Integrity found that Paterson had violated state laws concerning gifts to public officials, and that he <a href="perjury">lied under oath</a> to the commission about his intent to pay for the tickets. The commission further found that Paterson used his position to solicit and receive the five tickets—valued at US$425 each—free of charge from the Yankees, that he had never intended to pay for the tickets despite testimony to the contrary, and that he or a person acting on his behalf wrote a backdated check to pay for them only after scrutiny in the case arose.

Andha Naal

Andha Naal () is a 1954 Indian <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil-language</a> <a href="Mystery%20film">mystery</a>-<a href="Thriller%20film">thriller</a> film, produced by <a href="A.%20V.%20Meiyappan">A. V. Meiyappan</a> and directed by <a href="Sundaram%20Balachander">Sundaram Balachander</a>. It is the first <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> in <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a>, and the first Tamil film to be made without songs, dance, or stunt sequences. Set in the <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">milieu of World War II</a>, the story is about the killing of a radio engineer Rajan (<a href="Sivaji%20Ganesan">Sivaji Ganesan</a>). The suspects are Rajan's wife Usha (<a href="Pandari%20Bai">Pandari Bai</a>), the neighbour Chinnaiya Pillai (<a href="P.%20D.%20Sambandam">P. D. Sambandam</a>), Rajan's brother Pattabi (<a href="T.%20K.%20Balachandran">T. K. Balachandran</a>), Rajan's sister-in-law Hema (Menaka), and Rajan's mistress Ambujam (Suryakala). Each one's account of the incident points to a new suspect.

The lead role was initially offered to <a href="S.%20V.%20Sahasranamam">S. V. Sahasranamam</a> and <a href="N.%20Viswanathan">N. Viswanathan</a>, but they were unconvincing to Meiyappan. The screenplay and dialogue were written by <a href="Javar%20Seetharaman">Javar Seetharaman</a>, who also played a prominent role as an investigative officer in the film. Cinematography was handled by <a href="S.%20Maruti%20Rao">S. Maruti Rao</a>, and the background score was composed by <a href="AVM%20Productions">AVM Productions</a>' own music troupe, Saraswathy Stores Orchestra. The film was shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films. It was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.

The film was released on 13 April 1954, on the eve of "<a href="Puthandu">Puthandu</a>" (Tamil New Year). It was critically acclaimed and was awarded a <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Tamil">Certificate of Merit for Second Best Feature Film in Tamil</a> at the <a href="2nd%20National%20Film%20Awards">2nd National Film Awards</a> in 1955. Despite being a commercial failure at the time of its original release, it has acquired <a href="Cult%20film">cult status</a> over the years, and is regarded as an important film in Tamil cinema. In 2013, "Andha Naal" was included in <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a>'s list of the "100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time".
On the night of 11 October 1943, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>). The next morning, Rajan, a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiya Pillai, having heard the gunshot, complains to the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. <a href="Crime%20Investigation%20Department%20%28India%29">Crime Investigation Department</a> (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu to help with the investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room. Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.

The two policemen question five people in and around Rajan's house, most of whom are his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiya Pillai, who reported the gunshot. Chinnaiya Pillai proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and recalls a confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling that he and his wife would squander it. Chinnaiya Pillai concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.

When Sivanandam and Naidu interrogate Pattabi, who feels remorse for Rajan's death, he admits that he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to apportion the property. Pattabi states that Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.

Sivanandam leaves Naidu to interrogate Hema. She is initially impudent and refuses to give a statement about the crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with Ambujam, a dancer who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiya Pillai of murdering Rajan, saying that Chinnaiya Pillai was her foster father and wanted her to stay away from Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiya Pillai became infuriated and wanted to end the affair.

Sivanandam interrogates Usha, who tells him how she and Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky <a href="fountain%20pen">fountain pen</a> in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. Chinnaiya Pillai, Pattabi and Hema shoot him as instructed, but Usha fails to do so and bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.


According to <a href="Sundaram%20Balachander">Sundaram Balachander</a>'s wife Shanta Balachander, the director had watched <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s "<a href="Rashomon">Rashomon</a>" (1950) at a film festival, was inspired by it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by <a href="All%20India%20Radio">All India Radio</a>. Balachander later approached <a href="A.%20V.%20Meiyappan">A. V. Meiyappan</a>, the founder of <a href="AVM%20Productions">AVM Productions</a>, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. "Andha Naal" thus became the first Tamil film that did not have any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.

The role of the radio engineer Rajan was initially given to <a href="S.%20V.%20Sahasranamam">S. V. Sahasranamam</a>, who was dismissed after a few days of shooting because Balachander and Meiyappan were not satisfied with his performance and felt he looked "too old" to play the role. The makers then engaged newcomer <a href="N.%20Viswanathan">N. Viswanathan</a>, a Tamilian professor from Calcutta (now <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>). When the production was halfway through, Meiyappan was dissatisfied with his performance and wanted to reshoot the film with <a href="Sivaji%20Ganesan">Sivaji Ganesan</a>. When Balachander refused Meiyappan ordered the production controller Vasu Menon to settle Balachander's salary dues and to bring the reels to be burnt before him. Balachander was shocked on hearing this and obliged to Meiyappan's wish. Since Meiyappan had introduced Ganesan in "<a href="Parasakthi%20%28film%29">Parasakthi</a>" (1952), he was very keen to have him play the lead role. Initially, Balachander was hesitant to approach Ganesan because he was unsure whether he would agree to play a negative role. In his <a href="Autobiography%20of%20an%20Actor">autobiography</a>, Ganesan stated that the film was almost completed before he was approached. He agreed to be part of the film because he found the story interesting and thought that portraying a variety of characters would interest the audience. In 2009, film historian <a href="Film%20News%20Anandan">Film News Anandan</a> suggested that the success of "<a href="Thirumbi%20Paar">Thirumbi Paar</a>" (1953), which featured Ganesan as an <a href="antihero">antihero</a>, encouraged him to play a similar role in "Andha Naal". According to film historian <a href="Randor%20Guy">Randor Guy</a>, Rajan was one of the earliest antihero roles in Tamil cinema.

Ganesan initially demanded a sum of for the film, which Meiyappan could not afford to pay. He offered to pay him , which Ganesan declined. Balachander, however, convinced Ganesan that Meiyappan would pay him for every day they shot the film. A reluctant Ganesan agreed to this, believing the project would take a long time to complete. But to his dismay, Balachander completed the shoot in 17 days. The screenplay and dialogue were written by <a href="Javar%20Seetharaman">Javar Seetharaman</a>, who also appeared in the film as a C.I.D. officer, and provided the voiceover in the opening sequence before Rajan is shot. It was Seetharaman's first collaboration with AVM Productions as an actor and dialogue writer. <a href="Pandari%20Bai">Pandari Bai</a> was selected to play Rajan's wife, while Malayalam actor <a href="T.%20K.%20Balachandran">T. K. Balachandran</a>, actresses Suryakala and Menaka, and <a href="P.%20D.%20Sambandam">P. D. Sambandam</a> formed the rest of the cast.

V. Srinivasan – who later became popularly known as <a href="Muktha%20Srinivasan">Muktha Srinivasan</a> – assisted Balachander with the film. Cinematography was handled by <a href="S.%20Maruti%20Rao">S. Maruti Rao</a>, and editing was done by S. Surya. The background score was recorded by Saraswathy Stores Orchestra, AVM Productions' music troupe. Two <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> songs are used in the film in instrumental form: "Yeh Zindagi Usi Ki Hai" from "<a href="Anarkali%20%281953%20film%29">Anarkali</a>" (1953) and "Chup Chup Khade Ho" from "<a href="Bari%20Behen">Bari Behen</a>" (1949). No credit for the story is given in the introductory credits. "Andha Naal"s photography was markedly different from most early Tamil films. Rao used the "<a href="Light%20art%20performance%20photography">painting with light</a>" technique, which captures the actors' shadows to convey their "mood and character". Its final cut was shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films.

Regarded as the first <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> in Tamil cinema, "Andha Naal" is set in <a href="South-East%20Asian%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, during the bombing of the Indian city of Madras by Japanese forces in 1943. The story of the <a href="blind%20men%20and%20an%20elephant">blind men and an elephant</a> is referenced in the narrative, when Sivanandam notes how each suspect's account of Rajan's death contradicts those of the others.

Though various sources, including Ganesan, have stated that the film was inspired by "Rashomon", Randor Guy notes that this notion is erroneous, that "Andha Naal" was actually adapted from the 1950 <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British</a> film "<a href="The%20Woman%20in%20Question">The Woman in Question</a>" directed by <a href="Anthony%20Asquith">Anthony Asquith</a>, and that there was only a "thematic resemblance" between "Andha Naal" and "Rashomon". Film journalist Jason P. Vest describes the three films as following a <a href="nonlinear%20narrative">nonlinear narrative</a> by presenting diverging accounts of the same incident. Film historian Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai notes that "Andha Naal" is unrelated to "Rashomon" except for its <a href="whodunit">whodunit</a> plot, where the killing is explored using various angles, and also notes that, unlike "Rashomon", "Andha Naal" ends with the mystery being solved. In the opinion of B. Vijayakumar of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", "Andha Naal" is the first film noir made in South India.

According to Ganesan, the main theme of "Andha Naal" is patriotism; for him the film suggests that if a country does not appreciate its talented young men's efforts, they could turn against the nation. Regarding the more personal undertones, Ganesan said that the film tells how unemployment and desolation can lead young people to become traitors. Rajan becomes a traitor by selling Indian secrets to Japan because his idea was rejected by the Indian government. According to Guy, "Andha Naal" reuses the thematic line of the 1946 Tamil film "<a href="Chitra%20%281946%20film%29">Chitra</a>": "a person sending secret messages to the enemy through radio". Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai compared Pandari Bai's "ideologically driven" character Usha in the film to her character in "Parasakthi", but in the former, "it is the idea of the Indian nation that she pledges her allegiance to." "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" compared "Andha Naal" to "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>" (1941) for its similar lighting and camera angles.

The film uses a Tamil saying ""Kolaiyum Seival patthini"" (a virtuous wife may even kill her own husband) as a clue to the identity of the culprit. Usha is depicted as a virtuous wife and a patriot who loves her country. When she discovers that her husband has betrayed India, she decides to kill him. The jury of the <a href="2nd%20National%20Film%20Awards">2nd National Film Awards</a> described Naidu as a "conscientious" officer, and Sivanandam as a "brilliant, eccentric but not so serious" man.

"Andha Naal" received a "U" (universal) certificate by the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a> after 14 <a href="Censorship">cuts</a>. It was released on 13 April 1954 on the eve of "<a href="Puthandu">Puthandu</a>" (Tamil New Year). The film received critical acclaim upon release, but failed commercially as the audiences were disappointed over the absence of songs. In theatres, they were disappointed after the first scene when Ganesan's character is shot dead, and many even walked out. Theatre owners had to persuade them to watch the entire film. After its commercial failure, Meiyappan never again made a film without song sequences. The film was later re-released after winning the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Tamil">Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film in Tamil</a> at the 2nd National Film Awards (1955), and became a box-office success. <a href="Moser%20Baer">Moser Baer</a> and AP International have released the film on home video.

In addition to its National Film Award win, the film won a Best Film Award from the Madras Filmfans' Association in 1955. Contemporary critics lauded Meiyappan and Balachander for the <a href="experimental%20film">experimental film</a>. While Ganesan's role as an antihero won him critical acclaim, many critics felt that Pandari Bai's role as the patriotic wife overshadowed his performance. Many contemporary critics expected the film to be a trendsetter, but it failed to inspire many thematically similar films in Tamil. Several years later, Shanta recalled that Balachander was not affected by the film's failure as he was "delighted that he pulled it off", with critics praising the performances of Ganesan, Pandari Bai and the other actors.

A contemporary review from the Tamil monthly magazine "Kalaimanram" praised AVM for novelty and called "Andha Naal" a daring venture. The Tamil weekly "<a href="Kumudam">Kumudam</a>" (dated 1 May 1954) praised Meiyappan for recognising "young talents" like Balachander and Seetharaman. However, the reviewer criticised AVM for not publicising the film as a thriller; he asserted that had the film been publicised in such manner, the fans would not have been horrified by the absence of songs in the film. The reviewer's verdict was "Success of art; failure of narrative". The same month, a meeting was organised by the Film Fans Association in Madras to congratulate Meiyappan, Balachander, the actors and the other crew members. V. C. Gopalaratnam, the president of the association, praised Meiyappan for his "pioneering spirit" in producing a film without songs or dances. The Tamil magazine "Gundoosi" said that, for fans who were wondering whether there would be a day when a shorter film without songs and dance would be produced that had a narrative beyond the traditional love story, "That Day has come. Such a cinema of renaissance is "Andha Naal"". The writer also appreciated Maruti Rao's cinematography and Meiyappan's courageous effort, and asked fans to support such a film if they "really want Tamil cinema to progress". "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" praised the script by Seetharaman, the performances of Ganesan, Pandari Bai and Sambandam, the absence of songs and dance, and concluded that the film was "remarkable for some fine and original ideas in photography".

In a June 2008 retrospective, "The Times of India" gave the film a rating of four out of five, and stated that it had a "timeless feel both in terms of story telling and presentation." The reviewer praised Ganesan and Pandari Bai's performances, and concluded that Seetharaman's screenplay and Balachander's direction made "Andha Naal" one of the finest Tamil films to that point. Writing for "<a href="Deccan%20Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a>" in September 2014, Logesh Balachandran called Pandari Bai's role as a patriotic woman in the film a "memorable" one.

The film has been described by <a href="Cinema%20of%20France">French</a> film historian Yves Thoraval as a revolution in Tamil cinema for the absence of songs and dances. Though largely ignored at the time of its original release, it has since attained <a href="Cult%20film">cult status</a> in Tamil cinema. In addition to becoming a trendsetter for Tamil films without songs, it set a benchmark in Tamil cinema for noir-style lighting with some of its dramatic sequences. In 2001, journalist <a href="S.%20Muthiah">S. Muthiah</a> called "Andha Naal" the "best film" produced by Meiyappan. He noted that it "proved that a song-and-danceless film could also be a hit." In July 2007 when S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" asked eight Tamil film directors for a list of their all-time favourite Tamil films, three of them—<a href="K.%20Balachander">K. Balachander</a>, <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a> and <a href="Ameer%20%28director%29">Ameer</a>—named "Andha Naal". Malaysian author Devika Bai, writing for the "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>", described "Andha Naal" as Balachander's "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>", and Balachander as "Tamil cinema's Father of Film Noir".

The film is regarded by many critics as Balachander's best. Encouraged by its critical success, Balachander went on to direct and act in several more films of the same genre: "<a href="Avana%20Ivan">Avana Ivan</a>" (1962), "<a href="Bommai">Bommai</a>" (1964) and "<a href="Nadu%20Iravil">Nadu Iravil</a>" (1965). "Andha Naal" inspired several later whodunit films: including "<a href="Puthiya%20Paravai">Puthiya Paravai</a>" (1964), "<a href="Kalangarai%20Vilakkam">Kalangarai Vilakkam</a>" (1965), "<a href="Sigappu%20Rojakkal">Sigappu Rojakkal</a>" (1978), "<a href="Moodu%20Pani">Moodu Pani</a>" (1980) and "<a href="Pulan%20Visaranai">Pulan Visaranai</a>" (1990), and several songless Tamil films such as "<a href="Unnaipol%20Oruvan%20%281965%20film%29">Unnaipol Oruvan</a>" (1965), "Kudisai" (1979), "<a href="Veedu%20%281988%20film%29">Veedu</a>" (1988) and "Uchi Veyil" (1990). Researcher and ethnographer Preeti Mudliar compared "<a href="Ratha%20Kanneer">Ratha Kanneer</a>" (1954) to "Andha Naal" because in both films, "the sin of foreignness is [neutralised] by a chaste Tamil woman, the virtuous wife". Director <a href="Chimbu%20Deven">Chimbu Deven</a> acknowledged "Andha Naal" as an influence on his 2014 film "<a href="Oru%20Kanniyum%20Moonu%20Kalavaanikalum">Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalum</a>".

"Andha Naal" was screened in the "Tamil Retrospective Section" of the <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">14th International Film Festival of India</a> in 1991. In 2008, Randor Guy praised it for "being the first Tamil film which had no dance, song or stunt sequence and for [Balachander]'s impressive direction and fine performances by Sivaji Ganesan and Pandari Bai". In March 2012, film historian <a href="Mohan%20Raman">Mohan Raman</a> told "The Times of India" that, being the first film noir in Tamil cinema, it was "among the significant black and white films of yore", along with "<a href="Mayabazar">Mayabazar</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Uthama%20Puthiran%20%281940%20film%29">Uthama Puthiran</a>" (1940). In a 2013 interview with the Tamil magazine "<a href="Ananda%20Vikatan">Ananda Vikatan</a>", <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam</a> filmmaker <a href="Adoor%20Gopalakrishnan">Adoor Gopalakrishnan</a> listed "Andha Naal" as one of his earliest favourites in Tamil cinema. In April 2013, "Andha Naal" was included in <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a>'s list of "100 greatest Indian films of all time". In mid-April 2014, it was screened at the Russian Cultural Centre, Chennai, to mark its <a href="diamond%20jubilee">diamond jubilee</a> anniversary.

In March 2015, the Film Heritage Foundation announced that it would be restoring "Andha Naal" along with a few other Indian films from 1931 to 1965 as a part of its restoration projects being carried out in India and abroad. The Foundation stated that it would not colourise any of the films as they should be "the way the master or the creator had seen it." Filmmaker Shivendra Singh Dungarpur also believes that the film requires restoration on a "priority basis". A 30-minute play adaptation of the film was staged in April 2016, directed by Balachander's son Raman. Another play adaptation, also directed by him, was staged the following year, on 13 April.

Nintendo DSi

The Nintendo DSi is a dual-screen <a href="handheld%20game%20console">handheld game console</a> released by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. The console launched in Japan on November 1, 2008, and worldwide beginning in April 2009. It is the third <a href="iteration">iteration</a> of the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, and its primary market rival is <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP). The fourth iteration, entitled Nintendo DSi XL, is a larger model that launched in Japan on November 21, 2009, and worldwide beginning in March 2010. Development of the DSi began in late 2006, and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo. Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the <a href="Nintendo%20DS%20Lite">DS Lite</a>. Consequently, Nintendo removed the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> (GBA) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability.

While the DSi's design is similar to that of the DS Lite, it features two <a href="digital%20camera">digital camera</a>s, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop. Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization, so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and <a href="List%20of%20Nintendo%20DS%20games">standard DS titles</a>. The only exception to its <a href="backward%20compatibility">backward compatibility</a> are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.

Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were generally positive; although <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "<a href="bit-tech">bit-tech</a>" decried the console's lack of exclusive software and removal of the GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to those who had not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a> and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. <a href="CNET">CNET</a> and "<a href="PCWorld%20%28magazine%29">PCWorld</a>" considered the DSi Shop to be the most important buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" and "<a href="Wired%20UK">Wired UK</a>", on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.

Development of the Nintendo DSi started at the end of 2006. It was the first time Masato Kuwahara of Nintendo's Development Engineering Department served as a hardware project leader. Work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines; his team had to devise a theme for the new DS in time for a late December presentation, and by February 2007, most specifications for a <a href="chipset">chipset</a> had to be completed. Kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining the potential market for the handheld during the design process; he said of their goal, "We have to be able to sell the console on its own [without games at launch]. It also has to be able to meld into the already-existing DS market." The console's <a href="digital%20camera">digital camera</a>s were considered early in development: Nintendo president and Chief Executive Officer <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> described the <a href="touchscreen">touchscreen</a> as the Nintendo DS's sense of touch, and the microphone as its "ears"; a co-worker suggested that it should have "eyes". Kuwahara's team originally wanted one camera with a <a href="swivel">swivel</a> mechanism, but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability, cost, and the need of a thicker console. Owing to consumer demand, Nintendo also improved the handhelds' volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to the <a href="Nintendo%20DS%20Lite">Nintendo DS Lite</a>. However, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the GBA cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed. To compensate, Nintendo continued to support the DS Lite as long as there was consumer demand for it.
The DSi's size was changed midway through development, delaying its release. Its original design included two DS game card slots, because of demand from both fan communities and Nintendo employees, which consequently made it larger. When the console's designs were unveiled to <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20Analysis%20and%20Development">Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development</a> producers in October 2007, it was met with lukewarm reception due to its size. However, Iwata and Kuwahara's own hopes resulted in the creation of a prototype. A quick hands-on investigation led them to abandon the dual-slot design, which made the DSi approximately slimmer. Ever since the handheld's in-company unveiling, its internal designs were finished along with assembly and durability specifications. Iwata described having to resize the console so close to manufacturing as being essentially the same as making another handheld.

Yui Ehara, designer of the DS Lite and DSi's original casing, had to redesign the revised case. He advocated changing the six speaker apertures, as their circular perforations were redundant to the rest of the handheld's interface. He believed that this alteration also signaled a clearer distinction between the DSi and its predecessors while keeping the unit "neat" and "simple". Ehara hoped the DSi's added features would not interfere with his desired iconic image of the Nintendo DS product line: two rectangles, one on top of the other, with each half containing another rectangle inside. This model was publicly revealed at the October 2008 Nintendo Conference in Tokyo, along with its Japanese price and release date. While the DS product line's worldwide yearly sales figures consistently surpassed those of its primary market rival, Sony's PlayStation Portable, demand for it in Japan was decreasing; Nintendo's launch of the DSi was intended to stimulate sales. The company was less concerned with releasing the DSi in other territories, where DS Lite market demand remained high.

Development of a large DS Lite model in 2007 eventually led to the DSi XL (known in Japan as the ). Nintendo had designed a large DS Lite model with screens, compared to the standard screens; development of this new handheld advanced far enough that it could have begun <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a>. However, Iwata placed the project on hold due to consumer demand for the DS Lite and Wii. He later pitched the idea of simultaneously releasing large and small versions of the DSi instead, but Nintendo's hardware team was incapable of developing two models concurrently. After finishing work on the DSi, Kuwahara started the DSi XL project and became project leader. The DSi XL, a DSi model with screens, was announced on October 29, 2009. Various names for it were considered, including "DSi Comfort", "DSi Executive", "DSi Premium", "DSi Living", and "DSi Deka" (Japanese for "large"). "<a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Mario</a>" creator <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> insisted on "DSi Deka". The handheld has an improved <a href="viewing%20angle">viewing angle</a> over its predecessor, which allows onlookers to see the screen's contents more easily. This feature was absent from the large DS Lite model due to cost issues at the time, which also limited <a href="LCD%20screen">LCD screen</a> size. The cost of LCD screens is determined by how many pieces are cut from a single large glass sheet. To keep these costs within a certain threshold, Nintendo set a screen size limit of approximately , which was later increased to .

On November 1, 2008, the DSi was released in Japan; on April 2, 2009, in Australia and New Zealand, and on April 3 in Europe, all with a black and white casing. It launched in the United States and Canada on April 5, alongside the game "<a href="Rhythm%20Heaven">Rhythm Heaven</a>". It was the first DS console to launch with multiple colors in North America—black and blue. <a href="iQue">iQue</a> released a Chinese DSi model in black and white, with a pre-installed version of "<a href="Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>", in December 2009; the "<a href="Nikkei%20Sangyo%20Shimbun">Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun</a>" reported that the Chinese and Korean models featured improved security, to combat piracy. On April 15, 2010, the DSi was launched in South Korea in white, black, blue, and pink, alongside the game "<a href="MapleStory%20DS">MapleStory DS</a>". "MapleStory DS" was also bundled with a red limited-edition DSi, which had characters from the game printed around its external camera. Other countries the DSi was released in include Brazil, Russia, and Turkey.

Nintendo had shipped 200,000 units for the DSi's Japanese launch, and during its first two days on sale, over 170,000 units were sold—the remaining units were either unclaimed pre-orders or reserved for sale on <a href="Culture%20Day">Culture Day</a>. By the end of the month, the DSi sold 535,000 units, in comparison to 550,000 DS Lites sold in its launch month. In the two-day launch period, Europe and North American sales totaled 600,000 units combined. North American first week sales almost doubled the DS Lite's 226,000 units by selling 435,000. In the UK, the console totaled 92,000 sales within two days of release, which <a href="GfK">GfK</a>/<a href="Chart-Track">Chart-Track</a> data showed to be the fourth-best opening weekend ever in the region—higher than previous records set by other DS iterations.

DSi launch events were held on the western and eastern coasts of the United States. Nintendo sponsored an official launch event at the <a href="Universal%20CityWalk">Universal CityWalk</a> in Los Angeles and the <a href="Nintendo%20World%20Store">Nintendo World Store</a> in New York City. The LA midnight launch party featured several events, including merchandise handouts, signings and art galleries from <a href="iam8bit">iam8bit</a>, <a href="parkour">parkour</a> demonstrations, and performances by <a href="Gym%20Class%20Heroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>. Hundreds attended and over 150 stayed until midnight to purchase a unit at GameStop. A human-sized <a href="Lego">Lego</a> DSi by artist <a href="Sean%20Kenney%20%28artist%29">Sean Kenney</a> was on display at the Nintendo World Store.

The Nintendo DSi XL was released in Japan on November 21, 2009, in bronze, burgundy, and white. The former two colors were available for its European launch on March 5, 2010, and its North American launch on March 28. The console launched in Australia on April 15, 2010, in bronze and burgundy. The DSi XL was released in other countries including Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. Over 100,500 units were sold during the console's first two days on sale in Japan, and 141,000 units were sold during its first three days in the United States.

The 2011 release of the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, the successor to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds, was announced on March 23, 2010, to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. According to industry analysts, the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL. M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the "XL is old news ... in Japan – and Nintendo is a very Japan-centric organization. This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting in the best interest of Nintendo of America." Iwata dismissed any significant impact when speaking to concerned investors, "those who are eager to buy Nintendo 3DS right after the announcement generally tend to react quickly to anything new on the market, and those who are purchasing a Nintendo DS today tend to react relatively slowly."

Nintendo targeted a wider <a href="demographic%20profile">demographic profile</a> with the first <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> (2004) than it had with the <a href="Game%20Boy%20line">Game Boy line</a>. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the <a href="List%20of%20million-selling%20game%20consoles">best-selling game console</a>, Sony's <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.

The "i" in DSi symbolizes both an individual person (I) and the handheld's cameras (eyes); the former meaning contrasts with the "i"'s in Wii, which represent players gathering together. Nintendo of America president <a href="Reggie%20Fils-Aim%C3%A9">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> said, "If Wii was about gaming for the masses, then think of DSi as creativity for the masses." Iwata has said that the DSi is meant to be a first camera for children, and a <a href="social%20network">social network</a>ing device for adults. In response to media commentary following the DSi's announcement, Iwata insisted that its new audio and camera capabilities are not meant to compete with mobile phones, the <a href="iPod">iPod</a>, or the PSP. He explained their role in the marketplace:

The DSi helped maintain strong sales for Nintendo's handheld product line. The DSi accounted for 40 percent of its product line's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability. In the United States, the console's initial three-month sales surpassed those of the DS, DS Lite, and Wii. Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200,000 units for seven months after the DSi's April launch, while Wii sales diminished. <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles. In an October 2009 interview, Fils-Aimé announced that the DSi had sold 2.2 million units in the United States. He said, "If you give the consumer great value in terms of what they pay, they're willing to spend, and we say [that] based on the experience of launching the DSi". The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11.22 million units sold. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16.88 million of the 27.11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1, 2009 and ending March 31, 2010.

In Gamasutra's United States hardware sales estimate for July 2010, the DSi and DSi XL each outsold the DS Lite. The website reported DSi sales of approximately 300,000 units in July 2009 and February 2010, which remains consistent for July 2010 if combined with DSi XL sales. As a result, the average price consumers were spending on the Nintendo DS hardware family rose to over $165 (in 2004 dollars, $ adjusted for inflation as of 2010), which is over $15 more than the November 2004 launch price of the original Nintendo DS. Nintendo made its first DSi price cuts in Europe on June 18, 2010, for DSi and DSi XL consoles in Japan on June 19, and in North America on September 12. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 14.66 million of the 17.52 million units sold worldwide of its product line in fiscal year 2010.

In a United States hardware sales estimate for July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month earlier, about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price to match the DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012. Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line's "final send-off" and expects "by this time next year its contributions to the market will be minuscule. After Christmas, Nintendo will effectively be a single-handheld system company, putting all of portable software efforts into the Nintendo 3DS."
The Nintendo DSi's design is similar to that of the second DS iteration, the Nintendo DS Lite. It is approximately 12 percent shorter () than the Nintendo DS Lite when closed, but slightly wider and lighter. The DSi has two <a href="TFT%20LCD">TFT-LCD</a> screens— larger than those of previous models—that are capable of displaying 262,144 colors. The touch sensitive lower screen accepts input from the included <a href="stylus%20%28computing%29">stylus</a>. The handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. Two shoulder buttons, a <a href="DS%20Game%20Card">game card</a> slot, and a power cable input are placed under the console's hinge. The included <a href="AC%20adapter">AC adapter</a> (WAP-002) is not compatible with any previous DS model.

Unlike previous models, the handheld has two <a href="Video%20Graphics%20Array">VGA</a> (0.3-<a href="megapixel">megapixel</a>) digital cameras. The first is on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second is on the outer casing and faces away from the user. The <a href="Secure%20Digital%20card">SD card</a> slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on or off. The button has <a href="%23Features">extra functions</a> and unlike the original's power button, it is located on the bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The <a href="Headset%20%28audio%29">headset</a> port is on the bottom.

The DSi has a <a href="Gloss%20%28optics%29">matte</a> surface to hide fingerprints. It is available in numerous colors, but color selection varies by region. For example, lime green is exclusive to Japan, while red is available in Europe and North America. North America also received a different shade of blue. Numerous <a href="Special%20versions%20of%20the%20Nintendo%20DS">special-edition models and bundles</a> have been released, including those for "", "", and the 2009 <a href="Black%20Friday%20%28shopping%29">Black Friday</a> shopping day.

The DSi has more <a href="random-access%20memory">RAM</a> and a faster <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> than the DS Lite. Developers reported the console has a <a href="native%20mode">native mode</a>, which runs software specifically designed for its hardware, access to the system's extra processing and memory resources. The inclusion of a <a href="codec">codec</a> <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a> (a microchip) amplifies sound <a href="Signal%20%28electronics%29">signals</a> and <a href="Digital-to-analog%20converter">converts</a> them from <a href="Digital%20signal%20%28signal%20processing%29">digital</a> to <a href="Analog%20signal">analog</a>. This increases audio output, and depending on the mode, higher audio quality. Unused space on the <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a> was removed; the CPU was relocated, and the battery housing was expanded.

The camera's resolution is two-and-a-half times higher than the handheld's screens. However, their resolution is considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable <a href="Response%20time%20%28technology%29">response time</a> for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.

The Nintendo DSi XL features larger screens, and a greater overall size, than the original DSi. It is the fourth DS model, the first to be available as a pure size variation. Iwata said that cost restraints had, until then, limited the screen size and multiplayer aspects of portable game consoles, and that the DSi XL offers "an improved view angle on the screens", which makes it the first "portable system that can be enjoyed with people surrounding the gamer." He argued that this introduces a new method of playing portable video games, wherein those "surrounding the game player can also join in one way or the other to the gameplay." While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use, Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a "steady place on a table in the living room," so that it might be shared by multiple household members.

The DSi XL is the longest, widest and heaviest DS model. The console features two wide-viewing-angle LCD screens with the same resolution as the smaller model. It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings; for example, batteries last 13–17 hours at the dimmest setting. The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger <a href="speaker%20enclosure">speaker enclosure</a>s, enabling them to produce louder sound. The hinges stop the screen at 120° in addition to the original DSi's position of 155° to allow easier table-top viewing. The DSi XL is bundled with two longer styli, one of which is thicker, rounded, and pen-like, and does not fit inside the unit.

The DSi XL has a matte surface, and the exterior of its top panel is coated with a gloss finish. It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region such as white, green, red, yellow, and pink. Two special-edition models were released: those for "<a href="LovePlus">LovePlus+</a>" and the 25th anniversary of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" <a href="Flipnote%20Studio">Flipnote Studio</a> and the <a href="Nintendo%20DSi%20Browser">Nintendo DSi Browser</a> come pre-installed with the DSi XL, alongside other, region-specific software.

Like the Wii, the DSi has upgradeable <a href="firmware">firmware</a>, and features a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons. The seven primary icons represent "Card Software", "Nintendo DSi Camera", "Nintendo DSi Sound", "Nintendo DSi Shop", "<a href="DS%20Download%20Play">DS Download Play</a>", "<a href="PictoChat">PictoChat</a>", and "system settings"; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop. Icons are set in a grid navigable with the stylus or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The power button can either <a href="soft%20reset">soft reset</a> the console, returning it to the main menu, or shut it down. Game cards may be <a href="hot%20swapping">hot swapped</a> when the console is set to the main menu, allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down.

The DSi has more extensive <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> features than previous models; <a href="Advanced%20Audio%20Coding">AAC audio</a> files from other devices, pictures, and downloadable software can be stored to an SD card. The latter two do not need external storage and can be stored internally. Before taking a photograph, users may modify the viewfinder's live image with ten "lens" options. Images captured can be uploaded to the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s <a href="Photo%20Channel">Photo Channel</a>, and, for consoles with the 1.4 firmware update or greater, to the <a href="social%20network%20service">social networking</a> website <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>.

The built-in sound player has voice recording and music playback functionality. Voice recordings can be edited with <a href="audio%20filter">audio filter</a>s and manipulated through pitch and playback. Users may save and modify up to 18 ten-second sound clips. These clips cannot be exported to an SD card. Users can play music from SD cards with visualizations displayed on the upper screen. AAC audio with <a href="MPEG-4%20Part%2014">.mp4</a>, <a href="Apple%20Lossless">.m4a</a>, or <a href="3GP%20and%203G2">.3GP</a> <a href="filename%20extension">filename extension</a>s are supported, but non-AAC formats, including MP3, are not supported. Sounds like drum beats and the classic "Mario" jumping noises can be added with button presses. Playing music also has its own set of manipulation options similar to those used for voice recordings, as well as a group of audio filters. Using headphones, music can be played when the case is closed. Users may export photos, sounds, and Internet settings to a 3DS.

The Nintendo DSi connects to the Internet via either its built-in <a href="IEEE%20802.11%23802.11b">802.11b</a>/<a href="IEEE%20802.11%23802.11g">g</a> Wi-Fi or a <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20USB%20Connector">Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector</a>; both methods grant access to the <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> service. The DSi supports <a href="Wired%20Equivalent%20Privacy">WEP</a>, <a href="Wi-Fi%20Protected%20Access">WPA</a> (<a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">AES</a>/<a href="Temporal%20Key%20Integrity%20Protocol">TKIP</a>), and <a href="WPA2">WPA2</a> (AES/TKIP) <a href="Wireless%20LAN%20security">wireless encryption</a>; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were not supported by the DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the <a href="Wi-Fi%20Protected%20Setup">Wi-Fi Protected Setup</a> method and configure <a href="Proxy%20server">proxy</a> settings. The DSi can automatically detect <a href="Nintendo%20Zone">Nintendo Zone</a> service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.

All DS games are compatible with the DSi, except those that require the GBA slot. Because of its absence, the DSi is not <a href="backward%20compatibility">backward compatible</a> with GBA <a href="Game%20Pak">Game Pak</a>s or with <a href="Nintendo%20DS%20accessories">accessories</a> that require the GBA slot, such as the Nintendo DS <a href="Rumble%20Pak">Rumble Pak</a> and the guitar grip. "DSi-enhanced" game cards contain DSi-exclusive features, but can still be used with earlier models; "DSi-exclusive" game cards cannot. The DSi is Nintendo's first <a href="Regional%20lockout">region-locked</a> handheld; it prevents using certain software released for another region. Due to regional differences in Internet services and <a href="parental%20controls">parental controls</a>, DSi-specific software is region locked. However, cartridge software compatible with previous models, Internet browsing, and photo sharing are not locked. <a href="Nintendo%20DS%20storage%20devices%23Second%20generation">Homebrew flash cards</a> designed for previous DS models are incompatible with the DSi, but new cards capable of running DS software on a DSi were available.

Like the Wii, the DSi can connect to an online store. The store, called the DSi Shop, allows users to download DSiWare games and applications, which are paid for with a <a href="Nintendo%20Points">Nintendo Points</a> Prepaid Card (previously known as Wii Points Prepaid Card). Application prices follow a three-tiered pricing scheme. The service launched with the DSi Browser, a free web browser developed by <a href="Opera%20Software">Opera Software</a> and Nintendo. A DSiWare trial campaign, whose expiration date varied by region, formerly offered 1,000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop. As of June 2011, over 350 downloadable games were available, varying by region. Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo. Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS, however saved data cannot.

Nintendo Points became irredeemable on September 30, 2016, and the Nintendo DSi Shop was shut down on March 31, 2017.

The Nintendo DSi received generally positive reviews. Critics praised many of the console's changes to the DS Lite's aesthetic and functionality, but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Craig Harris noted that the DSi-exclusive software library and DSi Shop were lacking in content even after five months on the Japanese market. Jeff Bakalar of <a href="CNET">CNET</a> said that owners of the original DS should consider buying a DSi, but that its only incentive for DS Lite owners was the DSi Shop. <a href="PCWorld%20%28magazine%29">"PCWorld"</a> New Zealand's Jan Birkeland shared Bakalar's opinion, but believed that it was too early to judge the quality of DSi Shop software. Many critics were disappointed by the removal of the GBA cartridge slot, but some of them, such as "PCWorld"s Darren Gladstone, "<a href="Bit-tech">Bit-tech</a>"s Joe Martin, and IGN's Harris and Lowe, believed that it was a reasonable exchange for SD card support and the DSi Shop. However, Bakalar stated, "We'd gladly give up the 4 millimeters [of reduced thickness] to be able to play any Game Boy Advance game."

Most reviewers criticized the quality of its cameras, particularly due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones. They considered them sufficient for the DSi's screens, however. Harris and Lowe believed that the camera's only use was to take "silly pictures of yourself and others". They complained about the difficulty of taking photographs in low-light environments, and said that low-light images were tinged green or blue. Opinions on the DSi's photograph-editing tools were varied: "Bit-tech"s Martin and Reid considered them to be a gimmick, but Bakalar and Cliff Edwards of "<a href="BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</a>" thought otherwise. Edwards said that the camera's use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers; Martin did not think that the concept would be widely adopted, as he believed it to be "a gimmick that would alienate [...] DS Lite owners". <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Bramwell speculated that the DSi follows <a href="Game%20%26amp%3B%20Watch">Game & Watch</a> and <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a> creator <a href="Gunpei%20Yokoi">Gunpei Yokoi</a>'s philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new <a href="game%20design">game design</a> concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit. He argued its features are designed to "briefly entertain" <a href="early%20adopter">early adopter</a>s while encouraging "developers to consider it as an alternative [of the DS Lite]" to build an attractive game library for the long term.

Because of the DSi's additions to the DS Lite design, critics recommended the console to those who had not purchased a previous DS model. Pete Metzger of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" considered the DSi to be "more like version 2.5 than a total reboot", but called its new features "worthwhile additions to an already great product." Gladstone gave the DSi a score of 75/100, and said that Nintendo "puts in smart nips and tucks to its already-svelte handheld while adding a raft of useful multimedia features." Harris and Lowe defined the console's hardware redesign as "evolutionary", rather than "revolutionary". After the DSi was unveiled, <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> analyst Matthew J. Fassler called the DSi Shop a "tangible early threat" to <a href="big-box%20store">big-box store</a>s and retailers. Martin believed that the cameras and DSi Shop did not justify purchasing the DSi at launch, but, in line with the general consensus, saw potential in future software for the console.

Douglas Rankine of "<a href="Wired%20UK">Wired UK</a>" and McKinley Noble of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" thought previously existing Nintendo DS games were revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like "<a href="Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a>" and "<a href="The%20World%20Ends%20with%20You">The World Ends with You</a>" benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. <a href="ComputerAndVideoGames.com">CVG</a>'s Mike Jackson argued that the bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of "<a href="PC%20Magazine">PC Magazine</a>" thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained "if you tend not to carry it out with you, and only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".

Influenza

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a> caused by an <a href="influenza%20virus">influenza virus</a>. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s include: high <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="rhinorrhea">runny nose</a>, <a href="sore%20throat">sore throat</a>, <a href="myalgia">muscle pains</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a>, <a href="cough">cough</a>ing, <a href="sneezing">sneezing</a>, and <a href="fatigue%20%28medical%29">feeling tired</a>. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. In children, there may be <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, but these are not common in adults. Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>, which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as "stomach flu" or the "24-hour flu". Complications of influenza may include <a href="viral%20pneumonia">viral pneumonia</a>, secondary <a href="bacterial%20pneumonia">bacterial pneumonia</a>, <a href="sinus%20infection">sinus infection</a>s, and worsening of previous health problems such as <a href="asthma">asthma</a> or <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>.
Three of the four types of influenza viruses affect humans: Type A, Type B, and Type C. Type D has not been known to infect humans, but is believed to have the potential to do so. Usually, the virus is <a href="Airborne%20disease">spread through the air</a> from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, <a href="sputum">sputum</a>, or nose for the virus. A number of <a href="Rapid%20influenza%20diagnostic%20test">rapid tests</a> are available; however, people may still have the infection even if the results are negative. A type of <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> that detects the virus's <a href="RNA">RNA</a> is more accurate.
Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of viral spread. Wearing a <a href="surgical%20mask">surgical mask</a> is also useful. Yearly <a href="Influenza%20vaccine">vaccinations against influenza</a> are recommended by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well-tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. <a href="Antiviral%20drug">Antiviral drug</a>s such as the <a href="neuraminidase%20inhibitor">neuraminidase inhibitor</a> <a href="oseltamivir">oseltamivir</a>, among others, have been used to treat influenza. The benefit of antiviral drugs in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.
Influenza spreads around the world in <a href="flu%20season">yearly outbreaks</a>, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. About 20% of unvaccinated children and 10% of unvaccinated adults are infected each year. In the northern and southern <a href="middle%20latitudes">parts</a> of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in the winter, while around the <a href="equator">equator</a>, outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old, and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s are less frequent. In the 20th century, three <a href="influenza%20pandemic">influenza pandemic</a>s occurred: <a href="Spanish%20influenza">Spanish influenza</a> in 1918 (~50 million deaths), <a href="Asian%20influenza">Asian influenza</a> in 1957 (two million deaths), and <a href="Hong%20Kong%20influenza">Hong Kong influenza</a> in 1968 (one million deaths). The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> declared an outbreak of a new type of <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H1N1">influenza A/H1N1</a> to be a <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic">pandemic in June 2009</a>. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses, and birds.

Approximately 33% of people with influenza are asymptomatic.

Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection. Usually the first symptoms are <a href="chills">chills</a> and body aches, but fever is also common early in the infection, with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39 °C (approximately 100 to 103 °F). Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days, with aches and pains throughout their bodies, which are worse in their backs and legs.


It can be difficult to distinguish between the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> and influenza in the early stages of these infections. Influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, body ache, headache, and fatigue. Diarrhea is not usually a symptom of influenza in adults, although it has been seen in some human cases of the <a href="H5N1">H5N1</a> "bird flu" and can be a symptom in children. The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the adjacent table.

Since <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s are effective in treating influenza if given early (<a href="%23Treatment">see treatment section</a>, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two <a href="decision%20analysis">decision analysis</a> studies suggest that "during local outbreaks" of influenza, the <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> will be over 70%, and thus patients with any of these combinations of symptoms may be treated with <a href="neuraminidase%20inhibitors">neuraminidase inhibitors</a> without testing. Even in the absence of a local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the <a href="flu%20season">influenza season</a> as long as the prevalence is over 15%.

The available laboratory tests for influenza continue to improve. The United States <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests. According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 50–75% and specificity of 90–95% when compared with <a href="viral%20culture">viral culture</a>.

Occasionally, influenza can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, if a child (or presumably an adult) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.

Sometimes, influenza may have abnormal presentations, like confusion in the elderly and a sepsis-like syndrome in the young. Encephalitis due to the flu is rare but not unheard of.



In <a href="virus%20classification">virus classification</a>, influenza viruses are <a href="RNA%20viruses">RNA viruses</a> that make up four of the seven <a href="genera">genera</a> of the family <a href="Orthomyxoviridae">Orthomyxoviridae</a>:

These viruses are only distantly related to the <a href="human%20parainfluenza%20viruses">human parainfluenza viruses</a>, which are RNA viruses belonging to the <a href="paramyxovirus">paramyxovirus</a> family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as <a href="croup">croup</a>, but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults.

A fourth family of influenza viruses was identified in 2016 – <a href="Influenzavirus%20D">Influenza D</a>. The type species for this family is Influenza D virus, which was first isolated in 2011.

This genus has one species, influenza A virus. Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s. The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the four influenza types and cause the severest disease. The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different <a href="serovar">serotypes</a> based on the <a href="antibody">antibody</a> response to these viruses. The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:

This genus has one species, influenza B virus. Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans and is less common than influenza A. The only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza B infection are the <a href="pinniped">seal</a> and the <a href="ferret">ferret</a>. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2–3 times slower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As a result of this lack of <a href="antigen">antigen</a>ic diversity, a degree of <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species <a href="antigenic%20shift">antigenic shift</a>), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.

This genus has one species, influenza C virus, which infects humans, dogs and pigs, sometimes causing both severe illness and local epidemics. However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually only causes mild disease in children.

This genus has only one species, influenza D virus, which infects pigs and <a href="cattle">cattle</a>. The virus has the potential to infect humans, although no such cases have been observed yet. This virus is currently not associated with any major epidemics.

Influenzaviruses A, B, C, and D are very similar in overall structure. The virus particle (also called the virion) is 80–120 nanometers in diameter such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape. The length of each particle varies considerably, owing to the fact that influenza is pleomorphic, and can be in excess of many tens of micrometers, producing filamentous virions. However, despite these varied shapes, the viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition. These are made of a <a href="viral%20envelope">viral envelope</a> containing two main types of <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s, wrapped around a central core. The central core contains the viral <a href="RNA">RNA</a> <a href="genome">genome</a> and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA. RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double. Unusually for a virus, its genome is not a single piece of <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>; instead, it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented <a href="negative-sense">negative-sense</a> RNA, each piece of RNA containing either one or two <a href="gene">gene</a>s, which code for a gene product (protein). For example, the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA, encoding for 11 <a href="protein">protein</a>s: <a href="hemagglutinin%20%28influenza%29">hemagglutinin</a> (HA), <a href="viral%20neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a> (NA), <a href="Influenza%20virus%20nucleoprotein">nucleoprotein</a> (NP), <a href="M1%20protein">M1</a> (matrix 1 protein), <a href="M2%20protein">M2</a>, <a href="NS1%20Influenza%20Protein">NS1</a> (non-structural protein 1), NS2 (other name is NEP, nuclear export protein), PA, PB1 (polymerase basic 1), PB1-F2 and PB2.

<a href="Hemagglutinin%20%28influenza%29">Hemagglutinin</a> (HA) and <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a> (NA) are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles. HA is a <a href="lectin">lectin</a> that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell, while NA is involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells, by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles. Thus, these proteins are targets for <a href="antiviral%20drugs">antiviral drugs</a>. Furthermore, they are <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s to which <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> can be raised. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antibody responses to HA and NA. These different types of HA and NA form the basis of the "H" and "N" distinctions in, for example, "H5N1". There are 18 H and 11 N subtypes known, but only H 1, 2 and 3, and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans.

Viruses can replicate only in living cells. Influenza infection and replication is a multi-step process: First, the virus has to bind to and enter the cell, then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and RNA, assemble these components into new viral particles, and, last, exit the host cell.

Influenza viruses bind through <a href="hemagglutinin">hemagglutinin</a> onto <a href="sialic%20acid">sialic acid</a> sugars on the surfaces of <a href="epithelium">epithelial cells</a>, typically in the nose, throat, and <a href="lung">lung</a>s of mammals, and <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s of birds (Stage 1 in infection figure). After the hemagglutinin is <a href="proteolysis">cleaved</a> by a <a href="protease">protease</a>, the cell imports the virus by <a href="endocytosis">endocytosis</a>.

The intracellular details are still being elucidated. It is known that virions converge to the <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a> organizing center, interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release.

Once inside the cell, the acidic conditions in the <a href="endosome">endosome</a> cause two events to happen: First, part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the <a href="viral%20envelope">viral envelope</a> with the vacuole's membrane, then the M2 <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a> allows <a href="proton">proton</a>s to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus, which causes the core to disassemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins. The viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and <a href="RNA-dependent%20RNA%20polymerase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> are then released into the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> (Stage 2). The M2 ion channel is blocked by <a href="amantadine">amantadine</a> drugs, preventing infection.

These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense vRNA (Steps 3a and b). The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4) or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the <a href="Golgi%20apparatus">Golgi apparatus</a> onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a> and using the released <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting <a href="translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a> of host-cell mRNAs.

Negative-sense vRNAs that form the <a href="genome">genome</a>s of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and <a href="Capsid">viral core</a> proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host <a href="Lipid%20bilayer">phospholipid membrane</a>, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7). As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a> has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell. After the release of new influenza viruses, the host cell dies.

Because of the absence of RNA <a href="proofreading%20%28biology%29">proofreading</a> enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants; this causes <a href="antigenic%20drift">antigenic drift</a>, which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time. The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or <a href="reassortment">reassortment</a> of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces <a href="antigenic%20shift">antigenic shift</a>s, which are sudden changes from one antigen to another. These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity. This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed below in the section on <a href="%23Epidemiology">epidemiology</a>.

When an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. In otherwise healthy adults, influenza virus shedding (the time during which a person might be infectious to another person) increases sharply one-half to one day after infection, peaks on day 2 and persists for an average total duration of 5 days—but can persist as long as 9 days. In those who develop symptoms from experimental infection (only 67% of healthy experimentally infected individuals), symptoms and viral shedding show a similar pattern, but with viral shedding preceding illness by one day. Children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection. In immunocompromised people, viral shedding can continue for longer than two weeks.

Influenza can be spread in three main ways: by direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person); the airborne route (when someone inhales the <a href="particulate">aerosols</a> produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting) and through hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake. The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear, and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus. In the airborne route, the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0.5 to 5 <a href="%C2%B5m">µm</a> in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection. Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets, most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air. How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of <a href="humidity">humidity</a> and <a href="UV%20radiation">UV radiation</a>, with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter aiding its survival.

As the influenza virus can persist outside of the body, it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes, doorknobs, light switches and other household items. The length of time the virus will persist on a surface varies, with the virus surviving for one to two days on hard, non-porous surfaces such as plastic or metal, for about fifteen minutes from dry paper tissues, and only five minutes on skin. However, if the virus is present in mucus, this can protect it for longer periods (up to 17 days on banknotes). Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen. They are inactivated by heating to 56 °C (133 °F) for a minimum of 60 minutes, as well as by acids (at pH <2).

The mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively. One of the mechanisms is believed to be the inhibition of <a href="adrenocorticotropic%20hormone">adrenocorticotropic hormone</a> (ACTH) resulting in lowered <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a> levels.
Knowing which genes are carried by a particular strain can help predict how well it will infect humans and how severe this infection will be (that is, predict the strain's <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a>).

For instance, part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the <a href="proteolysis">cleavage</a> of the viral <a href="hemagglutinin">hemagglutinin</a> protein by any one of several human <a href="protease">protease</a>s. In mild and avirulent viruses, the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs, so these viruses cannot infect other tissues. However, in highly virulent strains, such as H5N1, the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases, allowing the virus to spread throughout the body.

The viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in the human <a href="respiratory%20tract">respiratory tract</a> a strain of influenza will bind. Strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in the upper part of the respiratory tract, such as in the nose, throat and mouth. In contrast, the highly lethal H5N1 strain binds to receptors that are mostly found deep in the lungs. This difference in the site of infection may be part of the reason why the H5N1 strain causes severe viral pneumonia in the lungs, but is not easily transmitted by people coughing and sneezing.

Common symptoms of the flu such as fever, headaches, and fatigue are the result of the huge amounts of proinflammatory <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s and <a href="chemokine">chemokine</a>s (such as <a href="interferon">interferon</a> or <a href="Tumor%20necrosis%20factor-alpha">tumor necrosis factor</a>) produced from influenza-infected cells. In contrast to the <a href="rhinovirus">rhinovirus</a> that causes the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>, influenza does cause tissue damage, so symptoms are not entirely due to the <a href="Inflammation">inflammatory response</a>. This massive immune response might produce a life-threatening <a href="cytokine%20storm">cytokine storm</a>. This effect has been proposed to be the cause of the unusual lethality of both the H5N1 avian influenza, and the 1918 pandemic strain. However, another possibility is that these large amounts of cytokines are just a result of the massive levels of viral replication produced by these strains, and the immune response does not itself contribute to the disease. Influenza appear to trigger <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a> (apoptosis).

The <a href="influenza%20vaccine">influenza vaccine</a> is recommended by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> and United States <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for high-risk groups, such as children, the elderly, health care workers, and people who have chronic illnesses such as <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>, or are immuno-compromised among others. In healthy adults it is modestly effective in decreasing the amount of influenza-like symptoms in a population. In healthy children over the age of 2, the vaccine reduces the chances of getting influenza by around two-thirds, while it has not been well studied in children under 2. In those with <a href="chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> vaccination reduces exacerbations, it is not clear if it reduces asthma exacerbations. Evidence supports a lower rate of influenza-like illness in many groups who are immunocompromised such as those with: <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, and post organ transplant. In those at high risk immunization may reduce the risk of <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>. Whether immunizing health care workers affects patient outcomes is controversial with some reviews finding insufficient evidence and others finding tentative evidence.

Due to the high <a href="mutation%20rate">mutation rate</a> of the virus, a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years. Every year, the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year (see <a href="Historical%20annual%20reformulations%20of%20the%20influenza%20vaccine">Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine</a>), allowing <a href="pharmaceutical%20company">pharmaceutical companies</a> to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains. The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season. It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics; occasionally, a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time. It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent, as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective.

Vaccines can cause the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to react as if the body were actually being infected, and general infection symptoms (many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms) can appear, though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long-lasting as influenza. The most dangerous <a href="adverse%20effect">adverse effect</a> is a severe <a href="allergy">allergic reaction</a> to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza; however, these reactions are extremely rare.

A 2018 Cochrane review of children in good general health found that the live immunization seemed to lower the risk of getting influenza for the season from 18% to 4%. The inactivated vaccine seemed to lower the risk of getting flu for the season from 30% to 11%. Not enough data was available to draw definite conclusions about serious complications such as pneumonia or hospitalization.

For healthy adults, a 2018 Cochrane review showed that vaccines reduced the incidence of lab-confirmed influenza from 2.3% to 0.9%, which constitutes a reduction of risk of approximately 60%. However, for influenza-like illness which is defined as the same symptoms of cough, fever, headache, runny nose, and bodily aches and pains, vaccine reduced the risk from 21.5% to 18.1%. This constitutes a much more modest reduction of risk of approximately 16%. The difference is most probably explained by the fact that over 200 viruses cause the same or similar symptoms as the flu virus.

The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. It has generally been found to be a cost-effective intervention, especially in children and the elderly, however the results of economic evaluations of influenza vaccination have often been found to be dependent on key assumptions.

These are the main ways that influenza spreads
Reasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as: not touching your eyes, nose or mouth; frequent <a href="hand%20washing">hand washing</a> (with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs); covering coughs and sneezes; avoiding close contact with sick people; and staying home yourself if you are sick. Avoiding spitting is also recommended. Although <a href="Surgical%20mask">face masks</a> might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick, there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community. Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms.

Since influenza spreads through both <a href="particulate">aerosols</a> and contact with contaminated surfaces, surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections. <a href="Alcohol">Alcohol</a> is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while <a href="Quaternary%20ammonium%20cation">quaternary ammonium compounds</a> can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer. In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and <a href="bleach">bleach</a> are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by patients with influenza symptoms. At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach.

<a href="Social%20distancing">Social distancing</a> strategies used during past pandemics, such as closing schools, churches and theaters, slowed the spread of the virus but did not have a large effect on the overall death rate. It is uncertain if reducing public gatherings, by for example closing schools and workplaces, will reduce transmission since people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another; such measures would also be difficult to enforce and might be unpopular. When small numbers of people are infected, isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission.

There are a number of rapid tests for the flu. One is called a Rapid Molecular Assay, when an upper respiratory tract specimen (mucus) is taken using a nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. It should be done within 3–4 days of symptom onset, as upper respiratory viral shedding takes a downward spiral after that.

People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of liquids, avoid using <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> and <a href="tobacco%20smoking">tobacco</a> and, if necessary, take medications such as acetaminophen (<a href="paracetamol">paracetamol</a>) to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu. They are also advised to avoid close contact with others to prevent spread of infection. Children and teenagers with flu symptoms (particularly fever) should avoid taking <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> during an influenza infection (especially <a href="Influenzavirus%20B">influenza type B</a>), because doing so can lead to <a href="Reye%27s%20syndrome">Reye's syndrome</a>, a rare but potentially fatal disease of the <a href="liver">liver</a>. Since influenza is caused by a virus, <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s have no effect on the infection; unless prescribed for <a href="secondary%20infection">secondary infection</a>s such as <a href="bacterial%20pneumonia">bacterial pneumonia</a>. Antiviral medication may be effective, if given early (within 48 hours to first symptoms), but some strains of influenza can show resistance to the standard antiviral drugs and there is concern about the quality of the research. High-risk individuals such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems should visit the doctor for antiviral drugs. Those with the <a href="Influenza%23Emergency%20Warning%20Signs">emergency warning signs</a> should visit the emergency room at once.

The two classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are <a href="neuraminidase%20inhibitor">neuraminidase inhibitor</a>s (<a href="oseltamivir">oseltamivir</a>, <a href="zanamivir">zanamivir</a>, <a href="laninamivir">laninamivir</a> and <a href="peramivir">peramivir</a>) and <a href="M2%20protein">M2 protein</a> inhibitors (<a href="adamantane">adamantane</a> derivatives).

Overall the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than the risks. There does not appear to be any benefit in those with other health problems. In those believed to have the flu, they decreased the length of time symptoms were present by slightly less than a day but did not appear to affect the risk of complications such as needing hospitalization or <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Increasingly prevalent resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has led to researchers to seek alternative antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action.

The <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s <a href="amantadine">amantadine</a> and <a href="rimantadine">rimantadine</a> inhibit a viral <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a> (<a href="M2%20protein">M2 protein</a>), thus inhibiting replication of the influenza A virus. These drugs are sometimes effective against influenza A if given early in the infection but are ineffective against influenza B viruses, which lack the M2 drug target. Measured resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in American isolates of <a href="H3N2">H3N2</a> has increased to 91% in 2005. This high level of resistance may be due to the easy availability of amantadines as part of over-the-counter cold remedies in countries such as China and Russia, and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry. The CDC recommended against using M2 inhibitors during the 2005–06 influenza season due to high levels of <a href="drug%20resistance">drug resistance</a>.

Influenza's effects are much more severe and last longer than those of the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>. Most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks, but others will develop life-threatening complications (such as <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>). Thus, influenza can be deadly, especially for the weak, young and old, those with compromised immune systems, or the chronically ill. People with a <a href="immunosuppression">weak immune system</a>, such as people with advanced <a href="HIV">HIV</a> infection or transplant patients (whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection), suffer from particularly severe disease. Pregnant women and young children are also at a high risk for complications.

The flu can worsen chronic health problems. People with emphysema, chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience <a href="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</a> while they have the flu, and influenza may cause worsening of <a href="coronary%20heart%20disease">coronary heart disease</a> or <a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a>. <a href="Tobacco%20smoking">Smoking</a> is another <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a> associated with more serious disease and increased mortality from influenza.

According to the World Health Organization: "Every winter, tens of millions of people get the flu. Most are only ill and out of work for a week, yet the elderly are at a higher risk of death from the illness. We know the worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year, but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain, because medical authorities don't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness." Even healthy people can be affected, and serious problems from influenza can happen at any age. People over 65 years old, pregnant women, very young children and people of any age with chronic <a href="medical%20conditions">medical conditions</a> are more likely to get complications from influenza, such as pneumonia, <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, <a href="Paranasal%20sinus">sinus</a>, and <a href="ear%20infection">ear infection</a>s.

In some cases, an <a href="autoimmune">autoimmune</a> response to an influenza infection may contribute to the development of <a href="Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9%20syndrome">Guillain–Barré syndrome</a>. However, as many other infections can increase the risk of this disease, influenza may only be an important cause during epidemics. This syndrome has been believed to also be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines. One review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations. Getting infected by influenza itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing GBS to a much higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approx. 10 times higher by recent estimates).

According to cdc.gov, "Children of any age with neurologic conditions are more likely than other children to become very sick if they get the flu. Flu complications may vary and for some children, can include pneumonia and even death.

Neurological conditions can include:
These conditions can impair coughing, swallowing, clearing the airways, and in the worst cases, breathing. Therefore, they worsen the flu symptoms.

Encephalitis is a rare but not unheard of, and can occur in the elderly and present as confusion and slurred speech.

Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter, and because the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>s have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two different flu seasons each year. This is why the World Health Organization (assisted by the <a href="National%20Influenza%20Centers">National Influenza Centers</a>) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere.

A long-standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year. One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role. Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucus particles. Dry particles are lighter and can thus remain airborne for a longer period. The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments (less than 5 °C) with low relative humidity. The lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions.

However, seasonal changes in infection rates also occur in tropical regions, and in some countries these peaks of infection are seen mainly during the rainy season. Seasonal changes in contact rates from school terms, which are a major factor in other <a href="List%20of%20childhood%20diseases">childhood diseases</a> such as <a href="measles">measles</a> and <a href="pertussis">pertussis</a>, may also play a role in the flu. A combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by dynamical resonance with the endogenous disease cycles. <a href="H5N1">H5N1</a> exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds.

An alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of <a href="vitamin%20D%20and%20influenza">vitamin D</a> levels on immunity to the virus. This idea was first proposed by <a href="Robert%20Edgar%20Hope-Simpson">Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson</a> in 1965. He proposed that the cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of vitamin D, which is produced in the skin under the influence of solar (or artificial) <a href="ultraviolet">UV radiation</a>. This could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during the tropical rainy season, when people stay indoors, away from the sun, and their vitamin D levels fall.

As influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of <a href="virus">virus</a>es, in any given year some strains can die out while others create <a href="epidemic">epidemic</a>s, while yet another strain can cause a <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>. Typically, in a year's normal two <a href="flu%20season">flu season</a>s (one per hemisphere), there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and around 500,000 deaths worldwide, which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic. Although the incidence of influenza can vary widely between years, approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza every year in the United States. One method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41,400 average deaths per year in the United States between 1979 and 2001. Different methods in 2010 by the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) reported a range from a low of about 3,300 deaths to a high of 49,000 per year.

Roughly three times per century, a pandemic occurs, which infects a large proportion of the world's population and can kill tens of millions of people (see <a href="Influenza%23Pandemics">pandemics section</a>). One study estimated that if a strain with similar <a href="virulence">virulence</a> to the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 influenza</a> emerged today, it could kill between 50 and 80 million people.
New influenza viruses are constantly <a href="evolution">evolving</a> by <a href="mutation">mutation</a> or by <a href="reassortment">reassortment</a>. Mutations can cause small changes in the <a href="hemagglutinin">hemagglutinin</a> and <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a> <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s on the surface of the virus. This is called <a href="antigenic%20drift">antigenic drift</a>, which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the pre-existing strains. This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population, often causing an epidemic. However, since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains, some people will still be immune to them. In contrast, when influenza viruses reassort, they acquire completely new antigens—for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains; this is called <a href="antigenic%20shift">antigenic shift</a>. If a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens, everybody will be susceptible, and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably, causing a pandemic. In contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift, an alternative approach has been proposed where the periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains.

The word "Influenza" comes from the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian language</a> meaning "influence" and refers to the cause of the disease; initially, this ascribed illness to unfavorable <a href="astrology">astrological</a> influences. It was introduced into English in the mid-eighteenth century during a pan-European epidemic.
Archaic terms for influenza include "epidemic catarrh", "la grippe" (from the French, first used by Molyneaux in 1694), "sweating sickness", and "Spanish fever" (particularly for the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> strain).

The symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> roughly 2,400 years ago. Although the virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history, historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret, because the symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases. The disease may have spread from Europe to the Americas as early as the <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European colonization of the Americas</a>; since almost the entire indigenous population of the Antilles was killed by an epidemic resembling influenza that broke out in 1493, after the arrival of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>.

The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580, which began in Russia and spread to Europe via Africa. In <a href="History%20of%20Rome%23Renaissance%20Rome">Rome</a>, over 8,000 people were killed, and several Spanish cities were almost wiped out. Pandemics continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the pandemic of 1830–1833 being particularly widespread; it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed.

The most famous and lethal outbreak was the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> (Spanish flu pandemic) (<a href="Influenzavirus%20A">type A influenza</a>, <a href="H1N1">H1N1</a> subtype), which lasted from 1918 to 1919. It is not known exactly how many it killed, but estimates range from 50 to 100 million people. This pandemic has been described as "the greatest medical holocaust in history" and may have killed as many people as the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>. This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by <a href="cytokine%20storm">cytokine storm</a>s. Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, or typhoid. One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and <a href="petechia">petechial hemorrhages</a> in the skin also occurred." The majority of deaths were from <a href="bacterial%20pneumonia">bacterial pneumonia</a>, a <a href="secondary%20infection">secondary infection</a> caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive <a href="bleeding">hemorrhages</a> and <a href="edema">edema</a> in the lung.

The 1918 flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> and remote <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific islands</a>. The unusually severe disease killed between two and twenty percent of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> of 0.1%. Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old. This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that 2.5% to 5% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, <a href="AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.

Later flu pandemics were not so devastating. They included the 1957 <a href="Asian%20Flu">Asian Flu</a> (type A, <a href="H2N2">H2N2</a> strain) and the 1968 <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Flu">Hong Kong Flu</a> (type A, <a href="H3N2">H3N2</a> strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In later pandemics <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918.

The first influenza virus to be isolated was from poultry, when in 1901 the agent causing a disease called "fowl plague" was passed through <a href="Chamberland%20filter">Chamberland filter</a>s, which have pores that are too small for <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> to pass through. The <a href="etiology">etiological</a> cause of influenza, the virus family Orthomyxoviridae, was first discovered in <a href="pig">pig</a>s by <a href="Richard%20Shope">Richard Shope</a> in 1931. This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by <a href="Patrick%20Laidlaw">Patrick Laidlaw</a> at the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20%28UK%29">Medical Research Council</a> of <a href="United%20Kingdom">the United Kingdom</a> in 1933. However, it was not until <a href="Wendell%20Stanley">Wendell Stanley</a> first crystallized <a href="tobacco%20mosaic%20virus">tobacco mosaic virus</a> in 1935 that the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">non-cellular</a> nature of viruses was appreciated.

The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the development in 1944 of a killed-virus vaccine for influenza by <a href="Thomas%20Francis%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Francis, Jr.</a> This built on work by Australian <a href="Frank%20Macfarlane%20Burnet">Frank Macfarlane Burnet</a>, who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hen's eggs. Application of this observation by Francis allowed his group of researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> to develop the first influenza vaccine, with support from the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>. The Army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when thousands of troops were killed by the virus in a matter of months. In comparison to vaccines, the development of anti-influenza drugs has been slower, with <a href="amantadine">amantadine</a> being licensed in 1966 and, almost thirty years later, the next class of drugs (the <a href="neuraminidase%20inhibitor">neuraminidase inhibitor</a>s) being developed.

Influenza produces <a href="variable%20cost">direct costs</a> due to lost <a href="productivity">productivity</a> and associated medical treatment, as well as <a href="indirect%20costs">indirect costs</a> of preventative measures. In the United States, seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over $11 billion, with direct medical costs estimated to be over $3 billion annually. It has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. However, the economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied, and some authors have suggested that the <a href="Spanish%20flu">Spanish influenza</a> actually had a positive long-term effect on per-capita income growth, despite a large reduction in the working population and severe short-term <a href="Recession">depressive</a> effects. Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. economy</a>, where 30% of all workers became ill, and 2.5% were killed. A 30% sickness rate and a three-week length of illness would decrease the <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> by 5%. Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18 million to 45 million people, and total economic costs would be approximately $700 billion.

Preventative costs are also high. Governments worldwide have spent billions of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">U.S. dollars</a> preparing and planning for a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic, with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing <a href="emergency%20management">disaster drills</a> and strategies for improved <a href="border%20control">border control</a>s. On 1 November 2005, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> unveiled the National Strategy to Safeguard Against the Danger of Pandemic Influenza backed by a request to <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan. Internationally, on 18 January 2006, donor nations pledged US$2 billion to combat bird flu at the two-day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.

In an assessment of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on selected countries in the Southern Hemisphere, data suggest that all countries experienced some time-limited and/or geographically isolated socio/economic effects and a temporary decrease in tourism most likely due to fear of 2009 H1N1 disease. It is still too early to determine whether the H1N1 pandemic has caused any long-term economic impacts.

Research on influenza includes studies on <a href="molecular%20virology">molecular virology</a>, how the virus produces disease (<a href="pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a>), host <a href="immune%20response">immune response</a>s, <a href="genomics">viral genomics</a>, and how the virus spreads (<a href="epidemiology">epidemiology</a>). These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures; for example, a better understanding of the body's immune system response helps <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> development, and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs. One important <a href="Research">basic research</a> program is the <a href="Influenza%20Genome%20Sequencing%20Project">Influenza Genome Sequencing Project</a>, which is creating a library of influenza sequences; this library should help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another, which genes most affect <a href="immunogenicity">immunogenicity</a>, and how the virus <a href="evolution">evolves</a> over time.

Research into new vaccines is particularly important, as current vaccines are very slow and expensive to produce and must be reformulated every year. The sequencing of the influenza genome and <a href="recombinant%20DNA">recombinant DNA</a> technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain. New technologies are also being developed to grow viruses in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a>, which promises higher yields, less cost, better quality and surge capacity. Research on a universal influenza A vaccine, targeted against the external domain of the transmembrane viral <a href="M2%20protein">M2 protein</a> (M2e), is being done at the <a href="University%20of%20Ghent">University of Ghent</a> by <a href="Walter%20Fiers">Walter Fiers</a>, <a href="Xavier%20Saelens">Xavier Saelens</a> and their team and has now successfully concluded Phase I clinical trials. There has been some research success towards a "universal flu vaccine" that produces antibodies against proteins on the viral coat which mutate less rapidly, and thus a single shot could potentially provide longer-lasting protection.

A number of <a href="biologic%20medical%20product">biologics</a>, therapeutic vaccines and immunobiologics are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses. Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens. Typically, biologics do not target <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s like anti-viral drugs, but stimulate immune cells such as <a href="lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a>, <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a>, and/or <a href="antigen%20presenting%20cell">antigen presenting cell</a>s, in an effort to drive an immune response towards a <a href="cytotoxic">cytotoxic</a> effect against the virus. Influenza models, such as murine influenza, are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics. For example, <a href="Lymphocyte%20T-Cell%20Immune%20Modulator">Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator</a> inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza.

Influenza infects many animal species, and transfer of viral strains between species can occur. <a href="Bird">Bird</a>s are thought to be the main <a href="host%20%28biology%29">animal reservoirs</a> of influenza viruses. Sixteen forms of <a href="hemagglutinin">hemagglutinin</a> and nine forms of <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a> have been identified. All known subtypes (HxNy) are found in birds, but many subtypes are endemic in humans, <a href="dog">dog</a>s, <a href="horse">horse</a>s, and <a href="pig">pig</a>s; populations of <a href="camel">camel</a>s, <a href="ferret">ferret</a>s, <a href="cat">cat</a>s, <a href="pinniped">seals</a>, <a href="mink">mink</a>, and <a href="whale">whale</a>s also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza. Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: <a href="Avian%20influenza">bird flu</a>, <a href="human%20flu">human flu</a>, <a href="swine%20flu">swine flu</a>, <a href="horse%20flu">horse flu</a> and <a href="dog%20flu">dog flu</a>. (<a href="Cat%20flu">Cat flu</a> generally refers to <a href="feline%20viral%20rhinotracheitis">feline viral rhinotracheitis</a> or <a href="feline%20calicivirus">feline calicivirus</a> and not infection from an influenza virus.) In pigs, horses and dogs, influenza symptoms are similar to humans, with cough, fever and <a href="Anorexia%20%28symptom%29">loss of appetite</a>. The frequency of animal diseases are not as well-studied as human infection, but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast in 1979–1980. However, outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality. <a href="influenza%20vaccine">Vaccines</a> have also been developed to protect <a href="poultry">poultry</a> from <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a>. These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy, or combined with <a href="culling">culling</a> in attempts to eradicate outbreaks.

Flu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific. The symptoms following infection with low-pathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruffled feathers, a small reduction in egg production, or <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a> combined with minor <a href="respiratory%20disease">respiratory disease</a>. Since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in the field difficult, tracking the spread of <a href="avian%20flu">avian influenza</a> requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds. Some strains such as Asian <a href="H9N2">H9N2</a> are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality. In its most highly pathogenic form, influenza in <a href="chicken">chicken</a>s and <a href="turkey%20%28bird%29">turkeys</a> produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100% mortality within two days. As the virus spreads rapidly in the crowded conditions seen in the <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a> of chickens and turkeys, these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers.

An avian-adapted, highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 (called HPAI A(H5N1), for "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1") causes <a href="transmission%20and%20infection%20of%20H5N1">H5N1 flu</a>, commonly known as "avian influenza" or simply "bird flu", and is <a href="endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a> in many bird populations, especially in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. This Asian lineage strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is <a href="global%20spread%20of%20H5N1">spreading globally</a>. It is <a href="epizootic">epizootic</a> (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the <a href="culling">culling</a> of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread. Most references in the media to "bird flu" and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain.

At present, HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease, and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1). In almost all cases, those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds. In the future, H5N1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. The exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood. However, due to the high lethality and <a href="virulence">virulence</a> of H5N1, its <a href="endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a> presence, and its large and increasing biological host reservoir, the H5N1 virus was the world's pandemic threat in the 2006–07 flu season, and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic.

In March 2013, the Chinese government reported three cases of H7N9 influenza infections in humans. Two of whom had died and the third was critically ill. Although the strain of the virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans, by mid-April, at least 82 persons had become ill from H7N9, of which 17 had died. These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing, raising at least the possibility of human-to-human transmission. WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out, as a matter of baseline information, that some viruses are able to cause limited human-to-human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks.

In pigs <a href="swine%20influenza">swine influenza</a> produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. In some cases the infection can cause abortion. Although mortality is usually low, the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a 3- to 4-week period. Direct transmission of an influenza virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (this is called <a href="zoonosis">zoonotic</a> swine flu). In all, 50 human cases are known to have occurred since the virus was identified in the mid-20th century, which have resulted in six deaths.

In 2009, a swine-origin <a href="H1N1">H1N1</a> virus strain commonly referred to as "swine flu" caused the <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic">2009 flu pandemic</a>, but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs (i.e. actually a swine flu) or of transmission from pigs to people, instead the virus is spreading from person to person. This strain is a reassortment of several strains of H1N1 that are usually found separately, in <a href="human%20influenza">humans</a>, <a href="avian%20influenza">birds</a>, and pigs.

The Lucy poems

The Lucy poems are a series of five poems composed by the English <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic</a> poet <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> (1770–1850) between 1798 and 1801. All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of "<a href="Lyrical%20Ballads">Lyrical Ballads</a>", a collaboration between Wordsworth and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> that was both Wordsworth's first major publication and a milestone in the early English <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic movement</a>. In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals of beauty, nature, love, longing and death.

The poem was written during a short period while the poet lived in Germany. Although they individually deal with a variety of themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had travelled with him to Germany but took up residence separately in the university town of Göttingen, and on his increasing impatience with his sister <a href="Dorothy%20Wordsworth">Dorothy</a>, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a> tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.

The "Lucy poems" consist of "<a href="Strange%20fits%20of%20passion%20have%20I%20known">Strange fits of passion have I known</a>", "<a href="She%20dwelt%20among%20the%20untrodden%20ways">She dwelt among the untrodden ways</a>", "<a href="I%20travelled%20among%20unknown%20men">I travelled among unknown men</a>", "<a href="Three%20years%20she%20grew%20in%20sun%20and%20shower">Three years she grew in sun and shower</a>", and "<a href="A%20slumber%20did%20my%20spirit%20seal">A slumber did my spirit seal</a>". Although they are presented as a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive of them as a group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as "experimental" in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of "Lyrical Ballads", and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group.

In 1798, Wordsworth and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> jointly published "<a href="Lyrical%20Ballads">Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems</a>", a collection of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the <a href="Romantic%20movement">Romantic movement</a> in English literature. In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions as set out in the preface to the 1802 edition: "The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect."

The two poets had met three years earlier in either late August or September 1795 in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. The meeting laid the foundation for an intense and profoundly creative friendship, based in part on their shared disdain for the artificial <a href="diction">diction</a> of the poetry of the era. Beginning in 1797, the two lived within walking distance of each other in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, which solidified their friendship. Wordsworth believed that his life before meeting Coleridge was sedentary and dull, and that his poetry amounted to little. Coleridge influenced Wordsworth, and his praise and encouragement inspired Wordsworth to write prolifically. <a href="Dorothy%20Wordsworth">Dorothy</a>, Wordsworth's sister, related the effect Coleridge had on her brother in a March 1798 letter: "His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did, as to the "mechanism" [emphasis in original] of poetry, and his ideas flow faster than he can express them." With his new inspiration, Wordsworth came to believe he could write poetry rivalling that of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>. He and Coleridge planned to collaborate, but never moved beyond suggestions and notes for each other.

The expiration of Wordsworth's <a href="Alfoxton%20House">Alfoxton House</a> lease soon provided an opportunity for the two friends to live together. They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge's wife, Sara, "to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish ourselves with a tolerable stock of information in natural science". In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of <a href="Ratzeburg">Ratzeburg</a> in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to moderately priced accommodations in <a href="Goslar">Goslar</a> in Lower Saxony, Germany.

Between October 1798 and February 1799, Wordsworth worked on the first draft of the "Lucy poems" together with a number of other verses, including the "<a href="The%20Matthew%20poems">Matthew poems</a>", "<a href="Lucy%20Gray">Lucy Gray</a>" and "<a href="The%20Prelude">The Prelude</a>". Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth's separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the "Lucy poems": "Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "A slumber". They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that "She dwelt" and "Strange fits" were "little Rhyme poems which I hope will amuse you". Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic "<a href="The%20Recluse%20%28poem%29">The Recluse</a>".

In the same letter, Wordsworth complained that:

Wordsworth partially blamed Dorothy for the abrupt loss of Coleridge's company. He felt that their finances—insufficient for supporting them both in Ratzeburg—would have easily supported him alone, allowing him to follow Coleridge. Wordsworth's anguish was compounded by the contrast between his life and that of his friend. Coleridge's financial means allowed him to entertain lavishly and to seek the company of nobles and intellectuals; Wordsworth's limited wealth constrained him to a quiet and modest life. Wordsworth's envy seeped into his letters when he described Coleridge and his new friends as "more favored sojourners" who may "be chattering and chatter'd to, through the whole day".

Although Wordsworth sought emotional support from his sister, their relationship remained strained throughout their time in Germany. Separated from his friend and forced to live in the sole company of his sister, Wordsworth used the "Lucy poems" as an emotional outlet.

Wordsworth did not reveal the inspiration for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians. Little biographical information can be drawn from the poems—it is difficult even to determine Lucy's age. In the mid-19th century, <a href="Thomas%20DeQuincey">Thomas DeQuincey</a> (1785–1859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet "always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials."

Critic Herbert Hartman believes Lucy's name was taken from "a neo-Arcadian commonplace", and argues she was not intended to represent any single person. In the view of one Wordsworth biographer, Mary Moorman (1906–1994), "The identity of 'Lucy' has been the problem of critics for many years. But Wordsworth is a poet before he is a biographer, and neither 'Lucy' nor her home nor his relations with her are necessarily in the strict sense historical. Nevertheless, as the "Lyrical Ballads" were all of them 'founded on fact' in some way, and as Wordsworth's mind was essentially factual, it would be rash to say that Lucy is entirely fictitious."

Moorman suggests that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders why she would be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It is more likely that Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.
In 1980, <a href="Hunter%20Davies">Hunter Davies</a> contended that the series was written for the poet's sister Dorothy, but found the Lucy–Dorothy allusion "bizarre". Earlier, literary critic Richard Matlak tried to explain the Lucy–Dorothy connection, and wrote that Dorothy represented a financial burden to Wordsworth, which had effectively forced his separation from Coleridge. Wordsworth, depressed over the separation from his friend, in this interpretation, expresses both his love for his sister and fantasies about her loss through the poems. Throughout the poems, the narrator's mixture of mourning and antipathy is accompanied by denial and guilt; his denial of the Lucy–Dorothy relationship and the lack of narratorial responsibility for the death of Lucy allow him to escape from questioning his desires for the death of his sister. After Wordsworth began the "Lucy poems", Coleridge wrote, "Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say. —Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die." It is, however, possible that Wordsworth simply feared her death and did not wish it, even subconsciously.

Reflecting on the significance and relevance of Lucy's identity, the 19th-century poet, essayist and literary critic <a href="Frederic%20William%20Henry%20Myers">Frederic Myers</a> (1843–1901) observed that:

Literary scholar <a href="Karl%20Kroeber">Karl Kroeber</a> (1926–2009) argues that Lucy "possesses a double existence; her actual, historical existence and her idealised existence in the poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl." Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human ... the poet describes her as dying at a point at which she would have been humanized." The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's <a href="muse">muse</a>, and the group as a whole "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared to be dead...As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost wordlessly aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'"

Scholar John Mahoney observes that whether Lucy is intended to represent Dorothy, Mary or another is much less important to understanding the poems than the fact that she represented "a hidden being who seems to lack flaws and is alone in the world." Furthermore, she is represented as being insignificant in the public sphere but of the utmost importance in the private sphere; in "She dwelt" this manifests through the comparison of Lucy to both a hidden flower and a shining star. Neither Lucy nor Wordsworth's other female characters "exist as independent self-conscious human beings with minds as capable of the poet's" and are "rarely allowed to speak for themselves."

The "Lucy poems" are written from the point of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now affected by her death. Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they are not about any one person who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet's lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth's inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, "invocations to a Muse feared to be dead". Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal and represents Wordsworth's frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.

Wordsworth's voice slowly disappears from the poems as they progress, and his voice is entirely absent from the fifth poem. His love operates on the subconscious level, and he relates to Lucy more as a spirit of nature than as a human being. The poet's grief is private, and he is unable to fully explain its source. When Lucy's lover is present, he is completely immersed in human interactions and the human aspects of nature, and the death of his beloved is a total loss for the lover. The 20th-century critic Spencer Hall argues that the poet represents a "fragile kind of humanism".

"Strange fits" is probably the earliest of the poems and revolves around a fantasy of Lucy's death. It describes the narrator's journey to Lucy's cottage and his thoughts along the way. Throughout, the motion of the moon is set in opposition to the motion of the speaker. The poem contains seven <a href="stanza">stanza</a>s, a relatively elaborate structure which underscores his ambivalent attitude towards Lucy's imagined death. The constant shifts in perspective and mood reflect his conflicting emotions. The first stanza, with its use of dramatic phrases such as "fits of passion" and "dare to tell", contrasts with the subdued tone of the rest of the poem. As a lyrical <a href="ballad">ballad</a>, "Strange fits" differs from the traditional ballad form, which emphasises abnormal action, and instead focuses on mood.

The presence of death is felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, a symbol of the beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays a significant role in the action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).

The narrator's conscious presence is wholly absent from the next stanza, which moves forward in what literary theorist <a href="Geoffrey%20Hartman">Geoffrey Hartman</a> describes as a "motion approaching yet never quite attaining its end". When the moon abruptly drops behind the cottage, the narrator snaps out of his dream, and his thoughts turn towards death. Lucy, the beloved, is united with the landscape in death, while the image of the retreating, entrancing moon is used to portray the idea of looking beyond one's lover. The darker possibility also remains that the dream state represents the fulfilment of the lover's fantasy through the death of the beloved. In falling asleep while approaching his beloved's home, the lover betrays his own reluctance to be with Lucy.

Wordsworth made numerous revisions to each of the "Lucy poems". The earliest version of "Strange fits" appears in a December 1798 letter from Dorothy to Coleridge. This draft contains many differences in phrasing and does not include a stanza that appeared in the final published version. The new lines direct the narrative towards "the Lover's ear alone", implying that only other lovers can understand the relationship between the moon, the beloved and the beloved's death. Wordsworth also removed from the final stanza the lines:

This final stanza lost its significance with the completion of the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed for a sense of anticipation at the poem's close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining "Lucy poems". Of the other changes, only the description of the horse's movement is important: "My horse trudg'd on" becomes "With quickening pace my horse drew nigh", which heightens the narrator's vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.

"She dwelt among the untrodden ways" presents Lucy as having lived in solitude near the source of the River Dove. According to literary critic Geoffrey Durrant, the poem charts her "growth, perfection, and death". To convey the dignified, unaffected naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mostly words of one syllable. In the opening <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>, he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, as well as her innocence and beauty, which he compares to that of a hidden flower in the second. The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line "When Lucy ceased to be" that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is "over before it has begun", while according to writer <a href="Margaret%20Oliphant">Margaret Oliphant</a> (1828–1897), Lucy "is dead before we so much as heard of her".

Lucy's "untrodden ways" are symbolic of both her physical isolation and the unknown details of her thoughts and life. The third quatrain is written with an economy intended to capture the simplicity the narrator sees in Lucy. Her femininity is described in girlish terms. This has drawn criticism from those who see the female icon, in the words of literary scholar John Woolford, "represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity". To evoke the "loveliness of body and spirit", a pair of complementary but paradoxical images are employed in the second stanza: the solitary, hidden <a href="Viola%20%28plant%29">violet</a> juxtaposed to the publicly visible <a href="Venus">Venus</a>, <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">emblem of love</a> and first star of evening. Wondering if Lucy more resembles the violet or the star, the critic <a href="Cleanth%20Brooks">Cleanth Brooks</a> (1906–1994) concludes that while Wordsworth likely views her as "the single star, completely dominating [his] world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly", the metaphor is a conventional compliment with only vague relevance. For Wordsworth, Lucy's appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion and her perceived affinity with nature.

Wordsworth acquired a copy of the <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> and <a href="Bishop">churchman</a> <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28Bishop%20of%20Dromore%29">Thomas Percy's</a> (1729–1811) collection of British ballads "<a href="Reliques%20of%20Ancient%20English%20Poetry">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</a>" (1765) in Hamburg a few months before he began to compose the series. The influence of the traditional English folk ballad is evident in the <a href="metre%20%28poetry%29">metre</a>, rhythm and structure of "She dwelt". It follows the variant ballad stanza a4–b3–a4–b3, and in keeping with ballad tradition tells a dramatic story. As Durrant observed, "To confuse the mode of the 'Lucy' poems with that of the love lyric is to overlook their structure, in which, as in the traditional ballad, a story is told as boldly and briefly as possible." Kenneth and Warren Ober compare the opening lines of "She dwelt" to the traditional ballad "<a href="Katharine%20Jaffray">Katharine Jaffray</a>" and note similarities in rhythm and structure, as well as in theme and imagery:

The narrator of the poem is less concerned with the experience of observing Lucy than with his reflections and meditations on his observations. Throughout the poem sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, a fact emphasised by the exclamation marks in the second and third verses. The critic Carl Woodring writes that "She dwelt" and the Lucy series can be read as <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a>, as "sober meditation[s] on death". He found that they have "the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek Anthology</a>... [I]f all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance".

An early draft of "She dwelt" contained two stanzas which had been omitted from the first edition. The revisions exclude many of the images but emphasise the grief that the narrator experienced. The original version began with floral imagery, which was later cut:

A fourth stanza, also later removed, included an explanation of how Lucy was to die: "But slow distemper checked her bloom / And on the Heath she died."

The last of the "Lucy poems" to be composed, "I travelled among unknown men", was the only one not included in the second edition of "Lyrical Ballads". Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801. Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to "I travelled" as a newly created poem. In 1802, he instructed his printer to place "I travelled" immediately after "A slumber did my spirit seal" in "Lyrical Ballads", but the poem was omitted. It was later published in "<a href="Poems%2C%20in%20Two%20Volumes">Poems, in Two Volumes</a>" in 1807.

The poem has frequently been read as a declaration of Wordsworth's love for his native England and his determination not to live abroad again:

The first two stanzas seem to speak of the poet's personal experience, and a patriotic reading would reflect his appreciation and pride for the English landscape. The possibility remains, however, that Wordsworth is referring to England as a physical rather than a political entity, an interpretation that gains strength from the poem's connections to the other "Lucy poems".

Lucy only appears in the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in mourning for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.

Although "I travelled" was written two years after the other poems in the series, it echoes the earlier verses in both tone and language. Wordsworth gives no hint as to the identity of Lucy, and although he stated in the preface to "Lyrical Ballads" that all the poems were "founded on fact", knowing the basis for the character of Lucy is not necessary to appreciating the poem and understanding its sentiment. Similarly, no insight can be gained from determining the exact geographical location of the "springs of Dove"; in his youth, Wordsworth had visited springs of that name in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, <a href="Patterdale">Patterdale</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>.

"Three years she grew in sun and shower" was composed between 6 October and 28 December 1798. The poem depicts the relationship between Lucy and nature through a complex opposition of <a href="Imagery%20%28literature%29">images</a>. <a href="antithesis">Antithetical</a> couplings of words—"sun and shower", "law and impulse", "earth and heaven", "kindle and restrain"—are used to evoke the opposing forces inherent in nature. A conflict between nature and humanity is described, as each attempts to possess Lucy. The poem contains both <a href="Epithalamium">epithalamic</a> and <a href="Elegy">elegiac</a> characteristics; Lucy is shown as wedded to nature, while her human lover is left alone to mourn in the knowledge that death has separated her from humanity.

Written in spare language, "A slumber did my spirit seal" consists of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, <a href="sleep">soporific</a> movement in which <a href="Literal%20and%20figurative%20language">figurative language</a> conveys the nebulous image of a girl who "seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation from the fact that she is now beyond life's trials, and "at last ... in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.

Although the "Lucy poems" share stylistic and thematic similarities, it was not Wordsworth but literary critics who first presented the five poems as a unified set called the "Lucy poems". The grouping was originally suggested by critic Thomas Powell in 1831 and later advocated by Margaret Oliphant in an 1871 essay. The 1861 "Golden Treasury", compiled by the English historian <a href="Francis%20Palgrave">Francis Palgrave</a> (1788–1861), groups only four of the verses, omitting "Strange fits". The poems next appeared as a complete set of five in the collection of Wordsworth's poems by English poet and critic <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> (1822–1888).
The grouping and sequence of the "Lucy poems" has been a matter of debate in literary circles. Various critics have sought to add poems to the group; among those proposed over the years are "<a href="Alcaeus%20to%20Sappho">Alcaeus to Sappho</a>", "<a href="Among%20all%20lovely%20things">Among all lovely things</a>", "<a href="Lucy%20Gray">Lucy Gray</a>", "<a href="Surprised%20by%20joy">Surprised by joy</a>", "<a href="Tis%20said%2C%20that%20some%20have%20died%20for%20love">Tis said, that some have died for love</a>", "<a href="Louisa%20%28poem%29">Louisa</a>", "<a href="Nutting%20%28poem%29">Nutting</a>", "<a href="Presentiments">Presentiments</a>", "<a href="She%20was%20a%20Phantom%20of%20delight">She was a Phantom of delight</a>", "<a href="The%20Danish%20Boy">The Danish Boy</a>", "<a href="The%20Two%20April%20Mornings">The Two April Mornings</a>", "<a href="To%20a%20Young%20Lady">To a Young Lady</a>", and "<a href="Written%20in%20Very%20Early%20Youth">Written in Very Early Youth</a>". None of the proposals have met with widespread acceptance. The five poems included in the Lucy "canon" focus on similar themes of nature, beauty, separation and loss, and most follow the same basic <a href="ballad">ballad</a> form. Literary scholar Mark Jones offers a general characterisation of a Lucy poem as "an untitled lyrical ballad that either mentions Lucy or is always placed with another poem that does, that either explicitly mentions her death or is susceptible of such a reading, and that is spoken by Lucy's lover."

With the exception of "A slumber", all of the poems mention Lucy by name. The decision to include this work is based in part on Wordsworth's decision to place it in close proximity to "Strange fits" and directly after "She dwelt" within "Lyrical Ballads". In addition, "I travelled" was sent to the poet's childhood friend and later wife, Mary Hutchinson, with a note that said it should be "read after 'She dwelt'". Coleridge biographer J. Dykes Campbell records that Wordsworth instructed "I travelled" to be included directly following "A slumber", an arrangement that indicates a connection between the poems. Nevertheless, the question of inclusion is further complicated by Wordsworth's eventual retraction of these instructions and his omission of "I travelled" from the two subsequent editions of "Lyrical Ballads".

The 1815 edition of "Lyrical Ballads" organised the poems into the "Poems Founded on the Affections" ("Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "I travelled") and "Poems of the Imagination" ("Three years she grew" and "A slumber"). This arrangement allowed the two dream-based poems ("Strange fits" and "A slumber") to frame the series and to represent the speaker's different sets of experiences over the course of the longer narrative. In terms of chronology, "I travelled" was written last, and thus also served as a symbolic conclusion—both emotionally and thematically—to the "Lucy poems".

According to critic Norman Lacey, Wordsworth built his reputation as a "poet of nature". Early works, such as "<a href="Tintern%20Abbey%20%28poem%29">Tintern Abbey</a>", can be viewed as <a href="ode">ode</a>s to his experience of nature. His poems can also be seen as <a href="Lyric%20poetry">lyrical</a> meditations on the fundamental character of the natural world. Wordsworth said that, as a youth, nature stirred "an appetite, a feeling and a love", but by the time he wrote "Lyrical Ballads", it evoked "the still sad music of humanity".

The five "Lucy poems" are often interpreted as representing Wordsworth's opposing views of nature as well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy can be seen as a connection between humanity and nature, as a "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer <a href="David%20Ferry%20%28poet%29">David Ferry</a> (b. 1924), "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".

Cleanth Brooks writes that "Strange fits" presents "Kind Nature's gentlest boon", "Three years" its duality, and "A slumber" the clutter of natural object. Other scholars see "She dwelt", along with "I travelled", as representing nature's "rustication and disappearance". Mahoney views "Three years" as describing a masculine, benevolent nature similar to a <a href="creator%20deity">creator deity</a>. Although nature shapes Lucy over time and she is seen as part of nature herself, the poem shifts abruptly when she dies. Lucy appears to be eternal, like nature itself. Regardless, she becomes part of the surrounding landscape in life, and her death only verifies this connection.

The series presents nature as a force by turns benevolent and malign. It is shown at times to be oblivious to and uninterested in the safety of humanity. Hall argues, "In all of these poems, nature would seem to betray the heart that loves her". The imagery used to evoke these notions serves to separate Lucy from everyday reality. The literary theorist <a href="Frances%20Ferguson">Frances Ferguson</a> (b. 1947) notes that the "flower similes and metaphors become impediments rather than aids to any imaginative visualization of a woman; the flowers do not simply locate themselves in Lucy's cheeks, they expand to absorb the whole of her ... The act of describing seems to have lost touch with its goal—description of Lucy."

The poems Wordsworth wrote while in Goslar focus on the dead and dying. The "Lucy poems" follow this trend, and often fail to delineate the difference between life and death. Each creates an ambiguity between the <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> and nothingness, as they attempt to reconcile the question of how to convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth." The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy's death and cries out in "She dwelt" of "the difference to me!". Yet in "A slumber" he is spared from trauma by sleep.

The reader's experience of Lucy is filtered through the narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar <a href="H.%20W.%20Garrod">H. W. Garrod</a> (1878–1960), "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places ... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version of the death of <a href="Pan%20%28mythology%29">Pan</a>, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline."

The first mention of the poems came from Dorothy, in a letter sent to Coleridge in December 1798. Of "Strange fits", she wrote, "[this] next poem is a favorite of mine—i.e. of me Dorothy—". The first recorded mention of any of the "Lucy poems" (outside of notes by either William or Dorothy) occurred after the April 1799 death of Coleridge's son Berkeley. Coleridge was then living in Germany, and received the news through a letter from his friend <a href="Thomas%20Poole%20%28tanner%29">Thomas Poole</a>, who in his condolences mentioned Wordsworth's "A slumber":
Later, the essayist <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a> (1775–1834) wrote to Wordsworth in 1801 to say that "She dwelt" was one of his favourites from "Lyrical Ballads". Likewise Romantic poet <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> (1795–1821) praised the poem. To the diarist and writer <a href="Henry%20Crabb%20Robinson">Henry Crabb Robinson</a> (1775–1867), "She dwelt" gave "the powerful effect of the loss of a very obscure object upon one tenderly attached to it—the opposition between the apparent strength of the passion and the insignificance of the object is delightfully conceived."

Besides word of mouth and opinions in letters, there were only a few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist <a href="John%20Stoddart">John Stoddart</a> (1773–1856), in a review of "Lyrical Ballads", described "Strange fits" and "She dwelt" as "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of "Poems in Two Volumes" in 1807 had a less positive opinion about "I travell'd": "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic <a href="Francis%20Jeffrey%2C%20Lord%20Jeffrey">Francis Jeffrey</a> (1773–1850) claimed that, in "Strange fits", "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" On "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about."

Many <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> critics appreciated the emotion of the "Lucy poems" and focused on "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as "powerfully pathetic". In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym "Parson Frank", remarked that "Strange fits" contained "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he does it in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!" A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that "Strange fits" had a "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'". Other reviewers emphasised the importance of "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", including Scottish writer <a href="William%20Angus%20Knight">William Angus Knight</a> (1836–1916), when he described the poem as an "incomparable twelve lines".

At the beginning of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so ready to talk about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death." Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of "Lyrical Ballads" are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment." Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply."

Later critics de-emphasised the significance of the poems in Wordsworth's artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies more on their popularity than importance to Wordsworth's poetic career. Davies went on to claim, "The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth's best-known work which he did in Germany, along with 'Nutting' and the Matthew poems, but the most "important" work was the beginning of "The Prelude"" (emphasis in original). Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, "It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form." Writer and poet <a href="Meena%20Alexander">Meena Alexander</a> (b. 1951) believed that the character of Lucy "is the impossible object of the poet's desire, an iconic representation of the Romantic feminine."

The "Lucy poems" have been <a href="parody">parodied</a> numerous times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned the way many 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a "<a href="meta">meta</a>-critical" manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son <a href="Hartley%20Coleridge">Hartley Coleridge</a> (1796–1849), called "On William Wordsworth" or simply "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for "<a href="The%20Inspector">The Inspector</a>" magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author <a href="Samuel%20Butler%20%28novelist%29">Samuel Butler</a> (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase "the difference to me!" was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was "most careful not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead ... but he has not said this." Not every work referring to the "Lucy poems" is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.

The "Lucy poems" (omitting "I travelled among unknown men" but adding "Among all lovely things") have been set for voice and piano by the composer Nigel Dodd. The settings were first performed at St George's, Brandon Hill, Bristol, in October 1995 at a concert marking the bicentenary of the first meeting of Wordsworth and Coleridge.

Among settings of individual poems is <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s "Lucy" ("I travelled among unknown men") composed in 1926.

The poem was set to music and recorded by the <a href="orchestral%20pop">orchestral pop</a> band <a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy%20%28band%29">The Divine Comedy</a> on their album <a href="Liberation%20%28The%20Divine%20Comedy%20album%29">Liberation</a>.

Michael Tritter

Detective Michael Tritter is a recurring fictional character in the <a href="medical%20drama">medical drama series</a> "<a href="House%20%28TV%20series%29">House</a>", portrayed by <a href="David%20Morse%20%28actor%29">David Morse</a>. He is the main <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a> of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a <a href="detective">police detective</a>, who tries to get Dr. <a href="Gregory%20House">Gregory House</a> (<a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a>) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a <a href="Rectal%20thermometry">thermometer in his rectum</a>. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers his <a href="Vicodin">Vicodin</a> <a href="Gregory_House%23Personality">addiction</a>. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">rehab</a>. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a>, and to finish his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict he tried to make him out to be.

The character was created as somebody who could go "toe-to-toe" with House.
Morse, who had never seen the show before, was unsure if he could portray the character and was not impressed after familiarizing himself with the show. The excited reaction of his friends to the opportunity convinced him to take the role. Initial critical responses to the character were mostly positive, but critics later felt that the seven-episode Tritter <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> became "boring"; however, Morse was praised for his portrayal and gained an <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20-%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a> <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for his appearance in the episode "Finding Judas". Morse stated in a 2006 "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" interview that, although he had discussed it with writers of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be "practically impossible".

Tritter first appears in the episode "<a href="Fools%20for%20Love">Fools for Love</a>". His character is a police detective who suffers from a severe irritation in the area of his groin, which he believes to be caused by a <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20disease">sexually transmitted disease</a>, and who becomes a patient of the walk-in clinic. Although House diagnoses Tritter with dry skin, a common side effect of the <a href="nicotine%20gum">nicotine gum</a> that Tritter is chewing, Tritter requests that a sample be tested. House declines on the grounds that he has already met this month's quota for indulging "stubborn idiots". After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists he has to take Tritter's temperature rectally. After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning. Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, <a href="Lisa%20Cuddy">Lisa Cuddy</a> (<a href="Lisa%20Edelstein">Lisa Edelstein</a>), saying that he would rather "beat the crap out of" House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize. Later that night, Tritter pulls House over for a traffic violation and arrests him after finding <a href="Vicodin">Vicodin</a> pills in his pocket.

In the next episode, "<a href="Que%20Sera%20Sera%20%28House%29">Que Será Será</a>", Tritter searches House's apartment and finds a large quantity of Vicodin pills and two apparently forged prescriptions that bear the name of House's friend <a href="James%20Wilson%20%28House%29">James Wilson</a> (<a href="Robert%20Sean%20Leonard">Robert Sean Leonard</a>). During "<a href="Son%20of%20Coma%20Guy">Son of Coma Guy</a>" and "<a href="Whac-A-Mole%20%28House%29">Whac-A-Mole</a>", Tritter pressures Wilson and members of House's diagnostic team to testify against him, but they all refuse. In "<a href="Finding%20Judas">Finding Judas</a>", Cuddy finds Tritter spending his day off looking through the hospital's log for evidence against House. She accuses him of not having a life and "personalizing every slight". Tritter responds that "nobody [at the hospital] is innocent", as everyone allows House to treat patients despite knowing of his Vicodin addiction and that it takes a police detective to uncover what the doctors are deliberately hiding. At the end of the episode, Wilson visits Tritter and indicates his willingness to testify.

In "<a href="Merry%20Little%20Christmas">Merry Little Christmas</a>", Tritter and Wilson work out a deal to allow House to continue practicing medicine if he pleads guilty and spends two months in rehab. Meanwhile, House uses a dead patient's name to obtain <a href="Oxycodone">Oxycodone</a> pills as a Vicodin replacement drug. When he visits Tritter early the next morning to agree to the deal, Tritter says the deal is off, after going through the pharmacy's log and reading that House signed for a dead man's drugs.

In the final days leading up to House's court case, House realizes the severity of the situation and finally apologizes to Tritter (episode "Words and Deeds"). When Tritter refuses to accept the apology, House goes into rehab, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, but Tritter cites his experiences with addicts as evidence House has not changed. The judge tells Tritter that she does not believe House to be the drug dealer that Tritter tried to show him to be and orders Tritter to move on after House is exonerated due to Cuddy committing <a href="perjury">perjury</a>. Just before the bailiff escorts House out of the courtroom, Tritter tells him: "Good luck. I hope I'm wrong about you."

The main antagonist of the third season, Tritter is a "stubborn", "vengeful", and extremely determined police detective. According to David Morse, the offensive thermometer incident in "Fools for Love" made it easy for Tritter to stand up to House; as House's equal, Tritter "gets who House is on all levels and can really shake his foundation". Tritter's experiences with drug addicts color his view of House, and he becomes so obsessed with House that, according to executive producer <a href="Katie%20Jacobs">Katie Jacobs</a>, the story arc turns into "a battle of egos" between them. The character shows a <a href="Psychological%20manipulation">manipulative</a> streak when he forms a plan to coerce each member of House's team to testify separately in "Finding Judas". Robert Bianco of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" described Tritter as an initially "legitimately, if belligerently, aggrieved adversary" character who later morphs into "some kind of insane supercop, tearing his way through the hospital and the Constitution at will".

The Tritter character was created as someone to go "toe-to-toe" with House. The producers envisioned a character with an inner strength, intelligence, and single-mindedness to match that of House. In 2006, "House" creator <a href="David%20Shore">David Shore</a> contacted actor <a href="David%20Morse%20%28actor%29">David Morse</a>, with whom he had previously worked on "<a href="Hack%20%28American%20TV%20series%29">Hack</a>", for a guest-starring episode arc on the show. According to Ellen Gray of the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>", Morse's earlier portrayals of "scary" cops (in "<a href="16%20Blocks">16 Blocks</a>" and "Hack") helped him clinch the role.

Morse was unfamiliar with the show. After watching several "House" episodes, he was surprised that the show had a strong audience with "[such] a total jerk" as the lead character. It was not until Morse told a few long-time friends about the job offer that their enthusiastic reaction convinced him to take the role. <a href="Katie%20Jacobs">Katie Jacobs</a>, executive producer of "House", was impressed by Morse's performance. In a 2006 "<a href="TV%20Guide%20%28magazine%29">TV Guide</a>" interview, Morse said that, although he discussed the possibility with "House" writers, it would be "practically impossible" to get the character to return in any later seasons.

Initial responses to the character were mostly positive. Maureen Ryan of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" declared Tritter the best male villain of the fall of 2006. <a href="Lisa%20Edelstein">Lisa Edelstein</a>, who portrays <a href="Lisa%20Cuddy">Lisa Cuddy</a> on "House", named David Morse as one of her favorite "House" guest stars, saying that he did a great job portraying the character. Barbara Barnett from "<a href="Blog%20Critics">Blog Critics Magazine</a>" and Charles McGrath of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" compared Tritter to <a href="Inspector%20Javert">Inspector Javert</a> of "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Misérables</a>", and Alynda Wheat from "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" stated that Tritter annoyed House more than any other character, surpassing other antagonists such as <a href="Amber%20Volakis">Amber Volakis</a> (<a href="Anne%20Dudek">Anne Dudek</a>), <a href="List%20of%20House%20characters%23Stacy%20Warner">Stacy Warner</a> (<a href="Sela%20Ward">Sela Ward</a>), and <a href="Lucas%20Douglas">Lucas Douglas</a> (<a href="Michael%20Weston">Michael Weston</a>). "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Stuart Levine considered Tritter a "worthy foe" for House.
However, the continued character arc increasingly bored critics. Staci Krause of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> found the first few episodes of Season 3, in which House recovers from being shot, more interesting. In a review of "Que Sera Sera", "Entertainment Weekly"s Michelle Kung noted that while David Morse is a fine actor, "his cop is so ridiculously one-note and revenge-bent that his scenes are often just excruciating to sit through". In a review for "Fools for Love", Sara Morrison of <a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a> doubted that Tritter's revenge on House was worth his time and aggravation, and later called the Tritter arc an "insane quest for ass-thermometer justice". "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>"s Alan Sepinwall stated that "pitting House against a comedy-impaired cop was both dull and not a fair fight".

The show's fans had shown dislike for other antagonists with multi-episode guest-starring arcs, and critics suspected that Tritter's character would receive similar disdain. The conclusion of the storyline, and Tritter's departure from the show, were described by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" critic Robert Bianco as a Christmas gift for fans of the show. Morse jokingly stated after his departure that various fans had told him of their hate for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House.

Morse, however, gained mainly positive responses to his portrayal of Tritter. "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall called Morse a "superb actor", and Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" stated that Morse's "understated performance" made Tritter all the more scary. <a href="Zap2it">Zap2it</a>'s Daniel Fienberg regarded Morse as "one of our very best character actors". Cynthia Littleton of "Variety", who already considered Morse's work in "<a href="St.%20Elsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a>" Emmy-worthy, was glad that Morse's submission of the episode "Finding Judas" for a 2007 <a href="Emmy%20Awards">Emmy Awards</a> consideration was accepted in the category of "<a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20-%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a>". The award eventually went to <a href="John%20Goodman">John Goodman</a> for "<a href="Studio%2060%20on%20the%20Sunset%20Strip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a>".

Same-sex marriage in Spain

Same-sex marriage in Spain has been legal since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected <a href="Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party">Socialist Party (PSOE)</a> Government, led by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a>, began a campaign for its introduction, including the right of <a href="LGBT%20adoption">adoption by same-sex couples</a>. After much debate, a law permitting <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> was passed by the "<a href="Cortes%20Generales">Cortes Generales</a>" (Spain's <a href="bicameralism">bicameral Parliament</a>, composed of the <a href="Senate%20of%20Spain">Senate</a> and the <a href="Congress%20of%20Deputies%20%28Spain%29">Congress of Deputies</a>) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making <a href="Spain">Spain</a> the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry on a national level, after the <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Belgium">Belgium</a>, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Canada">Canada</a>.

The ratification of this law was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Spain">Roman Catholic</a> authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening of the meaning of marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. <a href="Demonstration%20%28people%29">Demonstrations</a> for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain. After its approval, the <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a> <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a> challenged the law in the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Spain">Constitutional Court</a>.

Approximately 4,500 same-sex couples married in Spain during the first year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the <a href="legal%20status">legal status</a> of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A <a href="court%20ruling">ruling</a> from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's <a href="nationality">homeland</a> recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal <a href="Permanent%20residency">residence</a> in Spain.

The <a href="Spanish%20general%20election%2C%202011">November 2011 general election</a> delivered a landslide victory to the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a>, whose leader <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a> said that he opposed same-sex marriage, but any decision about repealing the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court. On 6 November 2012, the law was upheld by the Court with 8 support votes and 3 against. Minister of Justice <a href="Alberto%20Ruiz-Gallard%C3%B3n">Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón</a> announced that the Government will abide by the ruling and the law will not be repealed.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, several city councils and <a href="autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous communities</a> had opened registers for <a href="civil%20union">civil union</a>s (, "pareja de hecho" or "pareja estable") that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although the effect was mainly symbolic. Registries were eventually created in all 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> (1998), <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a> (1999), <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> (2000), <a href="Castile-La%20Mancha">Castile-La Mancha</a> (2000), <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a> (2001), <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a> (2001), <a href="Community%20of%20Madrid">Madrid</a> (2001), <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> (2002), <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> (2002), <a href="Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Castile and León</a> (2002), <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> (2003), <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a> (2003), <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> (2003), <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a> (2005), <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a> (2008), <a href="La%20Rioja%20%28Spain%29">La Rioja</a> (2010) and <a href="Region%20of%20Murcia">Murcia</a> (2018), and in both autonomous cities; <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> (1998) and <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a> (2008). Spanish law already allowed <a href="single%20%28relationship%29">single</a> people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution</a> gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.

The <a href="Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party">Socialist Party (PSOE)</a> manifesto for the <a href="Spanish%20general%20election%2C%202004">2004 general election</a> included the pledge of amending the <a href="Civil%20Code">Civil Code</a> to introduce same-sex marriage, granting it the same status as heterosexual marriage in order to "ensure full social and legal equality for lesbians and gays". After the socialists' victory in the election, the new <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a>, promised at his inauguration address to bring this change forward: "The moment has finally arrived to end once and for all the intolerable discrimination which many Spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences. (...) As a result, we will modify the Civil Code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects over inheritance, labor rights and social security protection". On 30 June 2004, then Minister of Justice <a href="Juan%20Fernando%20L%C3%B3pez%20Aguilar">Juan Fernando López Aguilar</a> announced that the <a href="Congress%20of%20Deputies%20%28Spain%29">Congress of Deputies</a> had provisionally approved a government plan for legislation to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples. López Aguilar also announced two propositions, introduced by the regional <a href="Convergence%20and%20Union">Convergence and Union</a> party of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>: one introduced <a href="legal%20status">legal status</a> for both opposite- and same-sex <a href="common-law%20marriage">common-law unions</a> ("parejas de hecho", "de facto unions"), while the other permitted <a href="transgender">transgender</a> people to legally <a href="name%20change">change their name</a> and sex designation without the requirement of <a href="sex%20reassignment%20surgery">surgery</a>. The bill regarding same-sex marriage was approved by the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Spain">Cabinet</a> on 1 October 2004, submitted to Parliament on 31 December, and passed by the Congress of Deputies on 21 April 2005. However, it was rejected on 22 June 2005 by the Senate, where the opposition <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a> held a plurality of the seats. The bill was returned to the lower house, which holds the power to override the Senate, and final approval was given to the bill on 30 June 2005 with 187 "yes" votes, 147 "no" votes, and 4 abstentions.

With the final approval, and enactment of the bill on 2 July 2005, Spain became the third country in the world to formally legalize same-sex marriages nationwide, after the <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Belgium">Belgium</a>.

The first same-sex wedding took place eight days after the bill became law, and was celebrated in the council chamber in the <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> suburb of <a href="Tres%20Cantos">Tres Cantos</a> by Carlos Baturín and Emilio Menéndez. The first same-sex marriage between women took place in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> eleven days later.

In spite of these steps toward <a href="equal%20treatment">equal treatment</a>, a legal flaw remained: if children were born within a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on <a href="reproductive%20technology">assisted reproduction</a>, allowing the non-biological mother to be regarded as a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.

The projected bill announced on 30 June 2004 by the Minister of Justice was studied by the <a href="General%20Council%20of%20the%20Judiciary">General Council of the Judiciary</a>. Although the General Council admitted that the existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned, it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same-sex couples (including collateral adoption). It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution, and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means, such as the extension of civil unions.

Despite this negative report, the Government presented the bill to Congress on 1 October 2004. With the exception of the People's Party and members of the <a href="Democratic%20Union%20of%20Catalonia">Democratic Union of Catalonia</a>, the different parliamentary parties favoured the reform. On 21 April 2005, Congress approved the bill, with 183 "yes" (including a member of the People's Party) and 136 "no" votes and 6 abstentions. The bill to allow same-sex marriage in Spain was short: it added a new paragraph to Article 44 of the <a href="Civil%20Code">Civil Code</a>, saying that "Matrimony shall have the same requisites and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex".

In accordance with constitutional provisions, the text approved by the Congress was then submitted to the Senate for final approval, change or <a href="veto">veto</a>. On 21 June 2005, experts were called to the Senate to debate the issue. The expert's opinions were diverse; some stated that <a href="LGBT%20adoption">same-sex adoption</a> had no effect on a child's <a href="child%20development">development</a>, except for perhaps a higher tolerance towards homosexuality. However, psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, called by the People's Party as an expert, called homosexuality a <a href="pathology">pathology</a> and <a href="emotional%20and%20behavioral%20disorders">emotive disorder</a>. Among other assertions that generated debate, he claimed that "many homosexuals have rape abuse antecedents since childhood" and that homosexuals generally come from families with "hostile, <a href="alcoholism">alcoholic</a> and distant" fathers, and mothers who were "<a href="over%20protective">over protective</a>" toward boys and "cold" toward girls. Prominent People's Party members later rejected Polaino's assertions.

The Senate vetoed the text submitted by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held the majority of the seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 "yes" and 119 "no" votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 "yes" votes (including a member of the People's Party, <a href="Celia%20Villalobos">Celia Villalobos</a>), 147 "no" votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying "We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society." <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a>, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.

When the media asked <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">King</a> <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">Juan Carlos</a> if he would sign the bill that was being debated in the "Cortes Generales", he answered that he was the King of Spain, not of <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">Belgium</a>a reference to King <a href="Baudouin%20of%20Belgium">Baudouin of Belgium</a>, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising <a href="abortion">abortion</a>. For the King to withhold his <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a>, it would effect a veto of the legislation. However, the King gave his royal assent to "Law 13/2005" on 1 July 2005, and the law was <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d in the "<a href="Bolet%C3%ADn%20Oficial%20del%20Estado">Boletín Oficial del Estado</a>" on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by <a href="Carlism">Carlist</a> and other far-right conservatives for signing the legislation.

The bill's passage was met with concern by Catholic authorities, including <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> — who warned of a weakening of <a href="family%20values">family values</a> — and his successor <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>. <a href="Alfonso%20L%C3%B3pez%20Trujillo">Cardinal López Trujillo</a>, president of the <a href="Pontifical%20Council%20for%20the%20Family">Pontifical Council for the Family</a>, said the Church was making an urgent call for <a href="freedom%20of%20thought">freedom of conscience</a> for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, even if it meant losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of <a href="Felipe%20VI%20of%20Spain">Prince Felipe</a> to <a href="Letizia%20Ortiz">Letizia Ortiz</a>, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though more than 60% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. <a href="sociology">Sociologists</a> believe this may be due to the significant increase of <a href="cultural%20liberalism">liberalism</a> in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the <a href="dictator">dictator</a> General <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, whose <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">regime</a> was closely linked to the Church.

Prime Minister Zapatero responded to Church criticism by saying:

On 19 June 2005, there was a public protest against the law. Protesters — led by People's Party members, <a href="List%20of%20the%20Roman%20Catholic%20dioceses%20of%20Spain">Spanish bishops</a> and the Spanish Family Forum ("Foro Español de la Familia") — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they considered an attack on the traditional family and Spanish values; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event. Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with <a href="gay%20pride">Gay Pride</a> Day, FELGT ("Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales" — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.

Spanish roman-catholic bishops also claimed that the Government, by extending the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that <a href="adoption">adoption</a> is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed for a long time in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> (2000), the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a> (2003), <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a> (2004), <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> (2005) and <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a> (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> (2002), <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> (2002) and <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a> would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of <a href="Psychology">Psychology</a>, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.

In a 2008 biography, <a href="Queen%20Sofia%20of%20Spain">Queen Sofia of Spain</a> revealed that she preferred the term "civil union" to "marriage" for committed same-sex relationships. This and other <a href="alleged">alleged</a> comments by the Queen opened the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">Spanish monarchy</a> to rare criticism in 2008, with the <a href="Palace%20of%20Zarzuela">Zarzuela palace</a> issuing an apology on behalf of the Queen for the "inexact" quotes attributed to her. Antonio Poveda, president of FELGT, said his organization accepted the Queen's apology, but added that there remains ill feelings by the <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Spain">gay community</a> towards the Queen over the comments. King Juan Carlos, known to be far more liberal than his wife, was reportedly incensed by the biography, with reporters stating the King will fire palace officials who allegedly approved official royal endorsement of the book.

During the <a href="Spanish%20general%20election%2C%202011">2011 general election</a>, People's Party leader and <a href="Prime%20minister%20of%20Spain">Prime Minister of Spain</a> <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a> stated he also prefers the term "civil union" to marriage for same-sex couples.

In late 2017, the Socialist Party began calling for a reform to the Spanish Constitution, which, among other changes, would constitutionally codify same-sex marriage.

Some Christian LGBT-friendly churches such as the <a href="Metropolitan%20Community%20Church">Metropolitan Community Church</a>, the <a href="Spanish%20Evangelical%20Church">Spanish Evangelical Church</a> and the <a href="Spanish%20Reformed%20Episcopal%20Church">Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church</a> support and perform same-sex marriages.

On 21 July 2005, a judge from the city of <a href="D%C3%A9nia">Dénia</a> refused to issue a marriage license to a lesbian couple. The judge also filed a constitutional challenge against the same-sex marriage law before the Constitutional Court based on Article 32 of the Constitution that contains the phrase "Men and women have the right to contract marriage with full juridical equality." In August 2005, a judge from <a href="Gran%20Canaria">Gran Canaria</a> refused licenses to three same-sex couples and mounted another constitutional challenge. In December 2005, the Constitutional Court rejected both challenges owing to both judges' lack of <a href="standing%20%28law%29">standing</a> to file them. On 30 September 2005, the opposition People's Party decided to initiate a separate constitutional challenge, causing division within the party. The outcome was published on 6 November 2012, seven years after the challenge was presented. The Court decided to uphold the same-sex marriage law with 8 support votes and 3 against.

On 27 February 2007, the Spanish Family Forum presented an initiative signed by 1.5 million people to legislate marriage as the union of a man and a woman only (thus effectively prohibiting same-sex marriage). The initiative was rejected by the Spanish Congress. On 30 May 2007, the aforementioned judge of Dénia was condemned by the Disciplinary Committee of the General Council of Judiciary Power ("Comisión Disciplinaria del Consejo General del Poder Judicial -CGPJ-") to pay 305 euros for refusing to marry a gay couple and was also strictly warned against doing it again. She attributes this action to the "propagandistic machinery" of the Government.

Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20India">did not permit</a> same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her <a href="Argentina">Argentinian</a> national partner (the <a href="First%20same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Spain">first same-sex marriage between women in Spain</a>). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.

On 27 July, the "Junta de Fiscales de Sala" – a body within the Public Prosecutor's Corp that advises the Minister of Justice's office – issued an opinion that <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> Spaniards can marry foreigners from countries that do not permit same-sex marriage. This marriage would be valid according to Spanish law, but did not imply automatic validity according to the foreigner's national law. A ruling published in the Official State Bulletin stated:

According to the instructions from the Ministry of Justice ("Dirección General de Registros y Notariado"), <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Spain">Spanish Consulates</a> abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At least one of the marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">Consulate</a> if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as at least one of the partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.

According to the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE), 50,565 same-sex marriages took place up to the end of 2017: 1,275 in 2005, 4,574 in 2006, 3,250 in 2007, 3,549 in 2008, 3,412 in 2009, 3,583 in 2010, 3,880 in 2011, 3,834 in 2012, 3,071 in 2013, 3,275 in 2014, 3,738 in 2015, 4,259 in 2016 and 4,606 in 2017.

Most same-sex marriages in 2011 took place in: <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> with 886 weddings (3.33% of all marriages in the community for that year), <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> with 729 marriages (2.91%), <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> with 484 (1.71%), <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a> with 436 (2.58%) and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> with 203 (3.60%).

On 2 July 2015, the Spanish National Statistics Institute revealed that 31,640 same-sex couples had married since the start of July 2005 (when same-sex marriage became legal in Spain) to July 2014. This accounted for 1.72% of all marriages in Spain in that time. In 2015, most same-sex marriages were celebrated in Catalonia (799), Madrid (726), Andalusia (575), Valencia (471) and the Canary Islands (265).

Although not an official same-sex marriage, in 1901 <a href="First%20same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Spain">Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa Sanchez Loriga</a> married by Elisa secretly being re-baptized as a man.

Since its legalization in 2005, couples from across section of Spanish society have entered into same-sex marriages. Within the first year the law received royal assent, influential <a href="Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party">Socialist</a> Leader and <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> City Councilor <a href="Pedro%20Zerolo">Pedro Zerolo</a> married Jesús Santos in January, and popular television presenter <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20V%C3%A1zquez%20%28television%20presenter%29">Jesús Vázquez</a> married Roberto Cortés in March. In October 2005, Spain's prominent <a href="Anti-terrorism%20legislation">anti-terrorism judge</a> <a href="Fernando%20Grande-Marlaska">Fernando Grande-Marlaska</a> married his fiancé Gorka Gómez. In August 2006, <a href="Ourense">Ourense</a> City Councilor and member of the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a> Pepe Araujo, whose party originally opposed the law, married his fiancé Nino Crespo. In September 2006, Alberto Linero Marchena and Alberto Sánchez Fernández, both army soldiers assigned to the <a href="Mor%C3%B3n%20Air%20Base">Morón Air Base</a> near <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, became Spain's first <a href="Spanish%20Armed%20Forces">military personnel</a> to marry under the new law. In August 2008, <a href="Do%C3%B1a">Doña</a> <a href="Luisa%20Isabel%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%2021st%20Duchess%20of%20Medina%20Sidonia">Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia</a> and three-time <a href="Grandee%20of%20Spain">Grandee of Spain</a> (branded the "Red Duchess" for her socialist activism), became the highest ranking <a href="Spanish%20nobility">Spanish noble</a> to marry in an "<a href="articulo%20mortis">articulo mortis</a>" (deathbed) wedding to longtime companion Liliana Maria Dahlmann, now the <a href="dowager">Dowager Duchess</a> of Medina Sidonia by right of her late wife. In June 2015, the then Mayor of the Basque capital <a href="Vitoria-Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a>, <a href="Javier%20Maroto">Javier Maroto</a>, announced his engagement to longtime partner Josema Rodríguez. The wedding was held on 18 September 2015 at Vitoria's City Hall. Maroto, a member of the conservative <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a>'s national board, is known for his views contrary to the stance of his own party pertaining to same-sex marriage in Spain. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a>, who had challenged the law approving same-sex marriage when he was Opposition Leader, attended the wedding celebrations as a guest.

A poll by the government-run Centre for Sociological Investigations ("Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas"), published in April 2005, reported that 66% of Spaniards favoured legalising same-sex marriage. Another poll taken by "Instituto Opina" a day before the bill passed placed support of the same-sex marriage bill at 62.1% and support of adoption by same-sex couples at 49.1%. An "Instituto Opina" poll taken nine months after the bill had passed said that 61% agreed with the Government's decision.

On 25 July 2007, the BBVA Foundation published their report "Social portrait of Spanish people", which reported that 60% of Spain's population supported same-sex marriage. This support occurred mainly among the younger population, between 15 and 34 years old (75%), people with higher education (71%), people not attached to any religion (75.5%), and those identified by left and centre-left political views (71.9%). However, only 44% of the population favored the right of <a href="LGBT%20adoption">adoption by same-sex couples</a>, in contrast to 42% opposition.

A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 76% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and another 13% supported other forms of recognition for same-sex couples.

According to an <a href="Institut%20fran%C3%A7ais%20d%27opinion%20publique">Ifop</a> poll, conducted in May 2013, 71% of <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and <a href="LGBT%20adoption">adopt children</a>.

The 2015 <a href="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a> found that 84% of <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 10% were against.

Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)

"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" is a song from <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>'s third studio album, "<a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">I Am... Sasha Fierce</a>" (2008). <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> released "Single Ladies" as a <a href="Single%20%28music%29">single</a> on October 13, 2008 as a <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">Double A-side</a> alongside "<a href="If%20I%20Were%20a%20Boy">If I Were a Boy</a>", showcasing the contrast between Beyoncé and her aggressive onstage <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a> Sasha Fierce. It explores men's unwillingness to <a href="Marriage%20proposal">propose</a> or commit. In the song, the female protagonist is in a club to celebrate her single status.

"Single Ladies" won three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s in <a href="52nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2010</a>, including <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a>, among other accolades. Several news media sources named it as one of the best songs of 2008, while some considered it one of the best songs of the decade. It topped the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart for four non-consecutive weeks and has been <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified quadruple-platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). The song charted among the top ten within the singles category in several other countries. Globally, it was 2009's seventh best-selling digital single with 6.1 million copies sold thus becoming <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20worldwide">one of the best-selling singles of all time</a>.

A black-and-white music video accompanied the single's release. It won several awards, including the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a> at the <a href="2009%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. Beyoncé has performed "Single Ladies" on television and during her concert tours. The song and particularly its music video have been widely parodied and imitated. Several notable artists have performed cover versions. Media usage has included placement in popular television shows.

"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was written by <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="The-Dream">Terius "The-Dream" Nash</a>, <a href="Kuk%20Harrell">Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell</a>, and <a href="Christopher%20Stewart%20%28music%20producer%29">Christopher "Tricky" Stewart</a>, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>, and it was <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> by <a href="Jaycen%20Joshua">Jaycen Joshua</a> and <a href="Dave%20Pensado">Dave Pensado</a>, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized "Single Ladies" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> recording artist <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was "the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that "people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate". She stated that although "Single Ladies" is a playful <a href="uptempo">uptempo</a> song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.

In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé portrays her <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a> Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of "<a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">I Am... Sasha Fierce</a>". The song was released simultaneously with "<a href="If%20I%20Were%20a%20Boy">If I Were a Boy</a>"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its <a href="Ballad%20%28music%29">ballads</a> and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; "Single Ladies" did so on <a href="mainstream%20urban">mainstream urban</a> New York radio station <a href="WWPR-FM">Power 105.1</a>. Both singles were added to <a href="rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic contemporary</a> radio playlists on October 12, 2008; "Single Ladies" was sent to <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban contemporary</a> playlists the same day, while "If I Were a Boy" was instead classified for <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a>. The two songs were released as a <a href="double%20A-side">double A-side</a> single on November 7, 2008, in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Dance <a href="remix">remix</a>es of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009, and in Europe on February 16, 2009. "Single Ladies" was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> as a result of download sales. On February 16, 2009, it was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a>, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.

"Single Ladies" is an <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">uptempo</a> <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> and <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song with <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a>, <a href="disco">disco</a> and <a href="bounce%20music">bounce</a> influences. It is set in <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a>, and makes use of <a href="staccato">staccato</a> bounce-based <a href="Clapping">hand claps</a>, <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a> <a href="Beep%20%28sound%29">beeps</a>, an ascending <a href="Whistling">whistle</a> in the background, and a punchy organic beat. The instrumentation includes a <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>, a <a href="Keyboard%20%28instrument%29">keyboard</a> and spaced out <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s that occasionally zoom in and out; one commentator, Sarah Liss of <a href="CBC%20News">CBC News</a>, noted that their arrangement surprisingly comes as light, instead of dense. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by <a href="Sony/ATV%20Music%20Publishing">Sony/ATV Music Publishing</a>, "Single Ladies" is written in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="E%20major">E major</a> and played in a moderate groove of 96.9 <a href="Tempo">beats per minute</a>. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of <a href="F%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a> to <a href="D%20%28musical%20note%29">D</a>. It has a <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> of E in the verses, and Bdim–C–Bdim–Am in the <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>. J. Freedom du Lac of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" noted the song features "playground vocals".

"Single Ladies" is musically similar to Beyoncé's 2007 single "<a href="Get%20Me%20Bodied">Get Me Bodied</a>"; Andy Kellman of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> called it a "dire throwback" to the song. Stewart and Harrell said in an interview given to "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine that the similar rhythm of the two songs is "what Beyoncé responds to". Ann Powers of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" saw the song's theme of female empowerment as an extension of that of "<a href="Irreplaceable">Irreplaceable</a>" (2006), and Daniel Brockman of "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Phoenix</a>" noted that its usage of "blurry pronouns" such as "it" resembles Beyoncé's 2005 single "<a href="Check%20on%20It">Check on It</a>". Liss commented that the beat of the "Single Ladies" evokes African <a href="Gumboot%20dance">gumboot dancing</a> and schoolyard <a href="Double%20Dutch%20%28jump%20rope%29">Double Dutch</a> chants, a view shared by Douglas Wolf of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine. Trish Crawford of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" concluded that "Single Ladies" is "a strong song of female empowerment", and other music critics have noted its appeal to Beyoncé's fan base of independent women as in the song, Beyoncé offers support to women who have split up from their no-good boyfriends.

In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé emphasizes her aggressive and sensual alter ego Sasha Fierce. She displays much attitude in her voice, as stated by Nick Levine of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>. Echoing Levine's sentiments, Liss wrote that Beyoncé sounds "gleefully sassy". The lyrics reflect post-breakup situations. Accompanied by robotic-like sounds, the opening lines of the song are <a href="call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call and response</a>; Beyoncé chants, "All the single ladies", and background singers echo the line each time. In the first <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">verse</a>, Beyoncé narrates the recent end to a poor relationship after she "cried [her] tears for three good years". She reclaims her right to flirt, have fun, and find a lover who is more devoted than the previous one. Beyoncé goes out to celebrate with her friends in a club where she meets a new love interest. However, her former boyfriend is watching her, and she directs the song to him. She then sings the chorus, which uses <a href="minor%20chord">minor chord</a>s and contains several <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>, "If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it ... Oh oh oh".

In the second verse, Beyoncé tells her ex-lover that, as he did not attempt to make things more permanent when he had the chance, he has no reason to complain now that she has found someone else. On the <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, she affirms that she wants her new love interest "to make like a prince and grab her, delivering her to 'a destiny, to infinity and beyond" while "Prince Charming is left standing there like the second lead in a romantic comedy". Towards the end of the song, Beyoncé takes a more aggressive vocal approach and employs a <a href="Thirty-two-bar%20form">middle eight</a> as she sings, "And like a ghost I'll be gone". When she chants the chorus for the third and final time, her vocals are omnipresent within layers of music, as described by Frannie Kelley of <a href="NPR">NPR</a>. An electronic swoop tugs in continuously until the song ends.

Nick Levine of Digital Spy particularly praised its beats, which according to him, "just don't quit". Michelangelo Matos of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" wrote that the song is "fabulous, with glowing production, a humongous hook, and beats for weeks". Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" was also impressed with the overall production of the song, specifically the chorus, adding "More than most female singers, Beyoncé understands the funky art of singing rhythmically, and this is a prime example." Fraser McAlpine of <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a> considered "Single Ladies" to be the best song Beyoncé has attempted since "<a href="Ring%20the%20Alarm">Ring the Alarm</a>" (2006) and complimented the former's refrain, describing it as "so amazingly catchy that it provides a surprisingly solid foundation for the entire song". Alexis Petridis of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" commended the threatening atmosphere that "Single Ladies" creates by using minor chords. Daniel Brockman of "The Phoenix" complimented the song's use of the word "it", and wrote that the technique "sums up her divided musical persona far more effectively than the [album's] two-disc split-personality gimmick."

Darryl Sterdan of <a href="Jam%21">Jam!</a> called the song single-worthy, and wrote that it is "a tune that actually sounds like a Beyoncé number". Sarah Liss of CBC News wrote that "Single Ladies" represents Beyoncé at her best, describing it as "an instantly addictive [and] a bouncy featherweight dance-pop track". She further commented that it was pleasant hear a voice which "changes timbre naturally, a voice with actual cracks and fissures (however slight)" in contrast to the "Auto-Tune epidemic that seems to be plaguing so many of her mainstream pop peers". Douglas Wolf of "Time" magazine added that "Single Ladies" is a sing-along which allows Beyoncé to demonstrate her virtuosity and "a focused, commanding display of individuality that speaks for every raised hand without a ring on it". <a href="Sasha%20Frere-Jones">Sasha Frere-Jones</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" wrote that the song combines a jumble of feelings and sounds that "don't resolve but also never become tiring". He concluded that "Single Ladies" was generally jubilant and that Beyoncé's vocals were pure and glimmering. Andy Kellman of Allmusic and Jessica Suarez of "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" magazine noted the song as one of the standouts from "I Am... Sasha Fierce", and saw similarities to "Get Me Bodied".

Writers praised the song's dance beat; Colin McGuire of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> praised "Single Ladies" as one of Beyoncé's best dance tracks. Spence D. of <a href="IGN%20Music">IGN Music</a> described the song as a "Caribbean flair and booty shaking jubilation that should get even the most staid of listeners snapping their necks and gyrating joyfully". Joey Guerra of the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" wrote that it is a "hip-shaking club" song similar to "Check on It". Leah Greenblatt of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" magazine wrote that "Single Ladies" is a "giddy, high-stepping hybrid of lyrical kiss-off and fizzy jump-rope jam". Describing the song as a "winning high-stepping" one, Adam Mazmanian of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" wrote that "Single Ladies" is designed to get the women out on the dance floor as Beyoncé sings it with "a genuinely defiant, independent voice". Some critics were unimpressed by "Single Ladies". Mariel Concepcion of "Billboard" magazine called it "standard screech-thump fare". "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"s Adam Mattera saw "Single Ladies" and "<a href="Diva%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles%20song%29">Diva</a>" as potential sources of inspiration for <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>s, although they may leave others confused. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized its lyrical inconsistencies, suggesting it is a "leftover" from "<a href="B%27Day%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20album%29">B'Day</a>".

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" named "Single Ladies" the best song of 2008, and wrote, "The beat ... is irresistible and exuberant, the vocal hook is stormy and virtuosic." "Single Ladies" ranked as the second-best song of the 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and "Rolling Stone" critics placed it at number 50 on the list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. "Single Ladies" was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it "hyperactive and supercharged in ways I never thought possible. It's epic and sexy and even a bit sad." "There is absolutely zero chance Beyoncé ever releases a single like this ever again", Montgomery concluded. "Time" magazine critic <a href="Josh%20Tyrangiel">Josh Tyrangiel</a>, who called the song "ludicrously infectious", ranked it as the seventh-best song of 2008. Douglas Wolf of the same publication placed it at number nine on his list of the All-Time 100 Songs.

"Single Ladies" appeared at number six on the "<a href="Eye%20Weekly">Eye Weekly</a>"s critics' list of the Best Singles of 2008, and at number six on <a href="About.com">About.com</a>'s Mark Edward Nero's list of the Best R&B Songs of 2008. On "The Village Voice"s year-end <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> singles list, "Single Ladies" was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. "Single Ladies" was named the best song of the 2000s decade by <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">Black Entertainment Television</a> (BET). Sarah Rodman, writing for "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", named "Single Ladies" the fourth most irresistible song of the decade, and stated, "[Beyoncé] combined leotards with crass engagement-bling baiting into one delicious sexy-yet-antiquated package. The video had the whole world dancing and waving along via YouTube." <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book "<a href="Eating%20the%20Dinosaur">Eating the Dinosaur</a>" (2009), <a href="Chuck%20Klosterman">Chuck Klosterman</a> wrote that "Single Ladies" is "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban <a href="bachelorette%20party">bachelorette parties</a>". <a href="Jody%20Rosen">Jody Rosen</a> of "The New Yorker" credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears."

"Single Ladies" has received a number of awards and nominations, including the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song">Best R&B Song</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20R%26amp%3BB%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female R&B Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="52nd%20Grammy%20Awards">52nd Grammy Awards</a>.

The song became Beyoncé's fifth solo single to top the Hot Digital Songs chart. "If I Were a Boy" charted at number three on the Hot 100 chart the same week, and thus Beyoncé became the seventh female in the US to have two songs in the top five positions of that particular chart.

It reached the top 10 in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, and the top 40 in both Belgian territories (Flanders and Wallonia), as well as in Hungary, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. "Single Ladies" was 2009's seventh best-selling digital single with 6.1 million units sold worldwide, and is <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20worldwide">one of the best-selling singles of all-time</a>.

The music video for "Single Ladies" was shot immediately after that of "If I Were a Boy", but it received less attention during production than the "higher-gloss, higher-profile video" for "If I Were a Boy". Both videos were shot in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> in New York City and were directed by <a href="Jake%20Nava">Jake Nava</a>, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles%20song%29">Crazy in Love</a>" and "<a href="Beautiful%20Liar">Beautiful Liar</a>". "Single Ladies" was choreographed by <a href="Frank%20Gatson%20Jr.">Frank Gatson Jr.</a> and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates <a href="J-Setting">J-Setting</a> choreography. The two music videos premiered on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, "<a href="Above%20and%20Beyonc%C3%A9%20%E2%80%93%20Video%20Collection%20%26amp%3B%20Dance%20Mixes">Above and Beyoncé</a>", and the platinum edition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce".
Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly" that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 <a href="Bob%20Fosse">Bob Fosse</a> routine entitled "Mexican Breakfast" seen on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>", which featured Fosse's wife, <a href="Gwen%20Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a>, dancing with two other women. "Mexican Breakfast" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after <a href="Unk">Unk</a>'s "<a href="Walk%20It%20Out%20%28Unk%20song%29">Walk It Out</a>" was dubbed over the original mix. Beyoncé wanted to attempt a similar dance and eventually, the choreography of "Single Ladies" was liberally adapted from "Mexican Breakfast":

I saw a video on YouTube. [The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.

Beyoncé wanted a simple music video; it was filmed with minimal alternative camera shots and cuts, and no changes to hairstyles, costumes and sets. According to JaQuel Knight, Beyoncé also wanted the video to feel "good and powerful" and include choreography that could be attempted by anybody. The day the video was shot, the song was divided into three parts. Nava deliberately used lengthy shots so that viewers "would connect with the human endeavor of Beyoncé's awe-inspiring dance", with all the changes in looks, <a href="camera%20angle">angles</a>, and lighting executed live on-camera because he wanted to keep the feel "very organic and un-gimmicky". The styling was inspired by a "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" photo shoot. In the video Beyoncé wears a <a href="titanium">titanium</a> roboglove designed by her long-time jeweler, <a href="Lorraine%20Schwartz">Lorraine Schwartz</a>, to complement her alter ego Sasha Fierce. The glove consists of several pieces, including a ring and a separate component that covers Beyoncé's upper arm. She first wore the roboglove on the red carpet at the <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards%202008">MTV Europe Music Awards</a> on November 8, 2008. The video shoot took around twelve hours. Many performances of the song were filmed without interruption, and edited together to give the impression that the final video was filmed in a single <a href="take">take</a>.

In the video for "Single Ladies", emphasis is laid on Beyoncé's more aggressive and sensual side, her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows her in an asymmetrical <a href="leotard">leotard</a> and high-heels, with two backup dancers, Ebony Williams and <a href="Ashley%20Everett">Ashley Everett</a>. Beyoncé's mother, <a href="Tina%20Knowles">Tina Knowles</a>, designed the high-cut leotards after seeing something similar in the American <a href="musical%20film">musical film</a>s "<a href="A%20Chorus%20Line%20%28film%29">A Chorus Line</a>" and "<a href="All%20That%20Jazz%20%28film%29">All That Jazz</a>". The dance routine incorporates many styles, including <a href="jazz%20dance">jazz</a>, <a href="tap%20dance">tap</a>, and <a href="hip%20hop%20dance">hip hop</a>, and is credited with popularizing <a href="J-Setting">J-Setting</a>, a flamboyant <a href="lead%20and%20follow">lead and follow</a> dance style prominent in many African American gay clubs across Atlanta and used by the all-female <a href="Jackson%20State%20University%23Sonic%20Boom%20of%20the%20South">Prancing J-Settes</a> dance troupe of <a href="Jackson%20State%20University">Jackson State University</a>.

The video features Beyoncé and her two companions dancing inside an <a href="infinity%20cove">infinity cove</a>, which alternates between black and white and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to <a href="Shirley%20MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>'s act in the 1969 film "<a href="Sweet%20Charity%20%28film%29">Sweet Charity</a>". Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.

Although the video for "Single Ladies" was the cheapest and quickest of all her videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being "the most iconic ... something special". It spawned a <a href="Novelty%20and%20fad%20dances">dance craze</a> and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, many of which were posted on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video." Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach. In an interview with Chandler Levack for "Eye Weekly", Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited "Single Ladies" with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to "consciously look for music videos because of its art".

The music video has won several awards and accolades. It was voted Best Dance Routine in the 2008 <a href="Popjustice">Popjustice</a> Readers' Poll; and won <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a> becoming the first black and white music video since <a href="Don%20Henley">Don Henley</a>'s <a href="The%20Boys%20of%20Summer%20%28song%29">The Boys of Summer</a>, <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Choreography">Best Choreography</a>, and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Editing">Best Editing</a> at the <a href="2009%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. The song also won Best Video at the 2009 <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards%202009">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>, the 2009 <a href="MOBO%20Awards%202009">MOBO Awards</a>, and the 2009 BET Awards. The video has also received many nominations: Best Video in the 2009 Popjustice Readers Polls (placed 4th); nine (including the three that it won) in the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards; <a href="Best%20International%20Artist%20Video%20%28MMVA%20Award%29">Best International Artist Video</a> at the <a href="2009%20MuchMusic%20Video%20Awards">2009 MuchMusic Video Awards</a> (losing to <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s "<a href="Poker%20Face%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Poker Face</a>"); Outstanding Music Video at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards; and two at the <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Awards%202009">2009 MTV Australia Awards</a> for Best Video and Best Moves. The video was ranked at number four on BET's "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2008" countdown, and at number three on VH1's Top 40 Videos of 2009. It was voted best music video of the 2000s decade by fans of the music website <a href="MUZU%20TV">MUZU TV</a> and fifth-best of the decade by readers of "Billboard" magazine. Claire Suddath of "Time" magazine included it in her 30 All-Time Best Music Videos, writing that "sometimes the best creations are also the simplest". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number one on their list of Beyoncé's ten best music videos writing, "[It has] All of the sex appeal. Ever... Beyoncé doesn't need anything but an empty room in this one. It's all about the dancing. It's all about the leotard. It's all about the fierceness. And it's epic.". The music video was certified platinum by CRIA for shipment of sales 10,000 units.

"Single Ladies" was nominated for nine awards at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American <a href="country%20pop">country pop</a> singer <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a>'s "<a href="You%20Belong%20with%20Me">You Belong with Me</a>", sparked controversy during the ceremony. Swift's acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, who grabbed her microphone to declare the "Single Ladies" video as "one of the best videos of all time". Footage of Beyoncé in the audience looking shocked was then shown. When Beyoncé won the Video of the Year award later that night, she reminisced about when she won her first MTV award with her former group, <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a>, and called the experience "one of the most exciting moments in [her] life". She then invited Swift on-stage to finish her speech and "have her moment".

Beyoncé first promoted "Single Ladies" in a concert organized by Power 105.1 radio in New York on October 29, 2008, and subsequently performed the song at various awards ceremonies, concerts and television shows. At the <a href="2008%20World%20Music%20Awards">2008 World Music Awards</a> in Monaco, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" while wearing her roboglove, and pointed to the glove as she sang the song's chorus. Beyoncé sang "Single Ladies" on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" ("SNL") on November 15, 2008. That night, Beyoncé was featured in a parody of the song's music video, where the two female backup dancers from the video were replaced by pop singer <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and "SNL" cast members <a href="Andy%20Samberg">Andy Samberg</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Moynihan">Bobby Moynihan</a>. On November 16, 2008, Beyoncé performed a medley of "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies", and "Crazy in Love" during the final episode of "Total Request Live". "Single Ladies" was also performed by Beyoncé on November 18, 2008, on "<a href="106%20%26amp%3B%20Park">106 & Park</a>", on November 23, 2008, at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202008">2008 American Music Awards</a>, on November 25, 2008, on "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" and on November 26, 2008, at <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Plaza</a> on "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">The Today Show</a>". She delivered a performance of "Single Ladies" with two male dancers on "<a href="The%20Tyra%20Banks%20Show">The Tyra Banks Show</a>" on January 9, 2009.

In July 2009, Beyoncé gave a concert at the <a href="Staples%20Center">Staples Center</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> where American actor <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> danced with her and her dancers as they performed the dance routine of "Single Ladies". At the MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" backed by "an army of single ladies" on stage. In a poll conducted by "Billboard" magazine, the performance was ranked as the seventh best in the history of <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>. A critic wrote in the magazine: "The world gave a collective 'whoa' when Beyonce unleashed her 'Single Ladies' video, but to see those dance moves come to life at the 2009 VMAs was beyond eye-popping." Erika Ramirez of the same publication placed the performance at number two on her list of Beyoncé's five biggest TV performances. "Single Ladies" was included on the <a href="set%20list">set list</a>s of Beyoncé's <a href="I%20Am...%20Yours">I Am... Yours</a> concerts and her <a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour">I Am... World Tour</a>. The song was subsequently included on Beyoncé's live albums "" (2009) and "<a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour%20%28album%29">I Am... World Tour</a>" (2010). "Single Ladies" was later performed by Beyoncé in a pink fringe dress at a concert at <a href="Palais%20Nikaia">Palais Nikaia</a> in Nice, France, on June 20, 2011, and at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202011">Glastonbury Festival</a> on June 26, 2011, in front of more than 175,000 spectators. On July 1, 2011, Beyoncé gave a free concert on "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>" as part of its "Summer Concert Series", which included "Single Ladies". Backed by her all-female band and her backing singers The Mamas, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" in front of 3,500 people during the <a href="4%20Intimate%20Nights%20with%20Beyonc%C3%A9">4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé</a> revue at the <a href="Roseland%20Ballroom">Roseland Ballroom</a> in New York, in August 2011. In May, 2012, Beyoncé performed the song during her revue at <a href="Revel%20Atlantic%20City">Revel Atlantic City</a>, a hotel. Ben Ratliff of "The New York Times" mentioned "Single Ladies" in the "almost continuous high point" of the concert. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote that Beyoncé's dancing during "Single Ladies" reflected the female empowerment theme of the song. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song along with her former bandmates from Destiny's Child during the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a> <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII%20halftime%20show">halftime show</a>. The song was added to the set list of her <a href="The%20Mrs.%20Carter%20Show%20World%20Tour">Mrs. Carter Show World Tour</a> (2013). Beyoncé's performed "Single Ladies" at The Sound of Change Live concert on June 1, 2013 at <a href="Twickenham%20Stadium">Twickenham Stadium</a>, London as part of the Chime for Change movement.

"Single Ladies" gained widespread popularity for its catchy hook and theme of female empowerment. Critics have compared the song to <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>'s "<a href="Respect%20%28song%29">Respect</a>" and <a href="Gloria%20Gaynor">Gloria Gaynor</a>'s "<a href="I%20Will%20Survive">I Will Survive</a>", prompted by their lyrics, which all promote female empowerment. The music video achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of <a href="jazz%20hands">jazz hands</a> with a wrist twist. It has been credited with starting the "first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography. Billy Johnson of Yahoo! Music wrote that the video of "Single Ladies" was the top music-related viral hit of 2009. MTV News' James Montgomery wrote that "it appears like [the music video] was custom-made for the YouTube generation, which probably explains why making homages became a worldwide phenomenon." The video generated interest in J-Setting, the dance form that choreographer JaQuel Knight highlights in the video, and Beyoncé is credited with bringing the dance style to the mainstream.

In a radio interview on NPR's "<a href="All%20Things%20Considered">All Things Considered</a>", Knight shared his excitement that the popular video made people want to learn to dance. Trish Crawford from the "Toronto Star" observed how it has appealed to all age groups and genders, in contrast with the short-lived dance craze inspired by <a href="Soulja%20Boy">Soulja Boy</a> two years before, which she considered "mainly a male hip-hop dance". Crawford mentioned, "Toddlers have tackled [the 'Single Ladies' dance]. [So have] recreation centre dance classes, sorority sisters in their dorm rooms, suburban teenagers in their basements and high school cheerleaders." In February 2009, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> announced the launch of a "Single Ladies" Dance Video Contest. Fans aged eighteen and older were invited to adhere precisely to the dance routine performed by Beyoncé and her two dancers in the original production. The winning video was included in her live album, "I Am... World Tour".

"Single Ladies" was first parodied in the November 15, 2008, episode of "SNL", which featured Beyoncé. She was initially reluctant to participate in the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [of our work] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, I have to take my hat off to them for doing it." Later, <a href="Joe%20Jonas">Joe Jonas</a> of the <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> band <a href="Jonas%20Brothers">Jonas Brothers</a> posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo <a href="Jedward">Jedward</a> parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of "<a href="All%20the%20Small%20Things">All the Small Things</a>". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote <a href="Trident%20%28gum%29">Trident Unwrapped</a> gum. On November 20, 2009, <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>readers including <a href="Fiona%20Bruce">Fiona Bruce</a>, <a href="Sophie%20Raworth">Sophie Raworth</a>, <a href="Kate%20Silverton">Kate Silverton</a>, and <a href="Susanna%20Reid">Susanna Reid</a> performed "Single Ladies" in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues <a href="Bill%20Turnbull">Bill Turnbull</a>, <a href="Ben%20Brown%20%28journalist%29">Ben Brown</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Nicholas Owen</a>, and <a href="Charlie%20Stayt">Charlie Stayt</a> before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>", in a dance-off. They performed the choreography to raise funds for the UK campaign, "<a href="Children%20in%20Need%202009">Children In Need</a>".

The music video inspired a legion of amateur imitators to post videos of themselves performing the choreography on YouTube. One of the most viewed <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a>s is that of Shane Mercado, who appeared on "<a href="The%20Bonnie%20Hunt%20Show">The Bonnie Hunt Show</a>" in bikini bottoms to perform the choreography. His subsequent meeting with Beyoncé became a media event. Beyoncé has acknowledged the popularity of the videos on YouTube; during her concert tour, excerpts from many of the YouTube videos were played in the background while Beyoncé was performing the song. Cubby, who is an on-air personality for <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>'s <a href="WHQC">96.1 The Beat AM</a>, based his parody on the "SNL" one. His video lead to a meet and greet with Beyoncé and eventually, an opportunity to join her on stage at a show stop in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> during her I Am... World Tour. Many videos featuring babies of different ages, imitating the dance choreography of "Single Ladies", have been uploaded on YouTube. A video showing Cory Elliott, a baby boy from New Zealand, performing the dance while watching Beyoncé on television, gained significant coverage from several media outlets. "Time" magazine's critic Dan Fletcher ranked it as the fourth best viral video of 2009 and wrote, "Young children love songs with good rhythm and repetition, and 'Single Ladies' certainly has both." However, when a video of seven-year-old girls performing choreography from "Single Ladies" at a dance competition in Los Angeles went viral on YouTube, it created a controversy and sparked outrage from many viewers, who felt the girls were sexualized by the suggestive dance moves.

In a video filmed by singer <a href="John%20Legend">John Legend</a>, US President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> appears with his wife Michelle performing part of the "Single Ladies" routine. He also briefly performed the hand-twirl move from the song's video at the <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Barack%20Obama">Obama Inaugural Celebration</a>. This video prompted an Obama look-alike, <a href="Iman%20Crosson">Iman Crosson</a>, to do his own version of the "Single Ladies" choreography. Several other well-known personalities, including American environmentalist and politician <a href="Joseph%20Nation">Joe Nation</a> and American actor <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, have performed the dance. In the music video for "<a href="Dancin%20on%20Me">Dancin on Me</a>" by <a href="DJ%20Webstar">DJ Webstar</a> and <a href="Jim%20Jones%20%28rapper%29">Jim Jones</a>, three females are featured in the background, imitating the "Single Ladies" dance. Wearing a black leotard and gold glove, <a href="Katy%20Brand">Katy Brand</a> performed the choreography with two backup female dancers for the final of <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>'s "<a href="Let%27s%20Dance%20for%20Comic%20Relief">Let's Dance for Comic Relief</a>" to raise money for the charity <a href="Comic%20Relief">Comic Relief</a> on March 12, 2010. <a href="Jenna%20Ushkowitz">Jenna Ushkowitz</a>, <a href="Chris%20Colfer">Chris Colfer</a> and <a href="Heather%20Morris">Heather Morris</a> did the "Single Ladies" dance as part of the <a href="Glee%20Live%21%20In%20Concert%21">Glee Live tour</a> in June 2011. The music minister at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, thought it would be "an excellent idea" to attract interest in the church choir by using a remix of "Single Ladies" and having choir members dance to it. In the music video he made, the choir members sing, "All the singing ladies, all the singing fellas ... If you like the choir, then won't you come and sing in it." Cyndi Wilkerson, Music Ministry Assistant at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church, uploaded the video to YouTube on August 29, 2011. In April 2013, YouTube phenomenon <a href="Psy">Psy</a> did the dance routine during a concert in Seoul while wearing a red leotard and red boots. A television advert for the South African cellular service <a href="Vodacom">Vodacom</a>, used the song as a backdrop to an actor who was humorously mimicking <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>'s dancing, the advert quickly went viral and spawed several different variations.

"Single Ladies" has been used in various media including television shows, commercials and books. In the Best of 2009 issue of "People" magazine, <a href="Khlo%C3%A9%20Kardashian">Khloe</a>, <a href="Kim%20Kardashian">Kim</a>, and <a href="Kourtney%20Kardashian">Kourtney Kardashian</a> were ranked at number nine on the magazine's list of "25 Most Intriguing People"; the photograph accompanying the article showed the three women in leotards mimicking the look from the "Single Ladies" video. The song has been included in many television shows, including "", "<a href="Cougar%20Town">Cougar Town</a>", and in two episodes in "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>". In the United Kingdom, the video for "Single Ladies" was used for a 2009 television commercial for the new <a href="Doner%20kebab">Doner kebab</a> flavored <a href="Pot%20Noodle">Pot Noodle</a>. In other media, issue 33 of comic book series "<a href="The%20Brave%20and%20the%20Bold">The Brave and the Bold</a>" features a scene in which <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="Zatanna">Zatanna</a>, and <a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a> sing a karaoke version of the song while at a club. A <a href="mashup%20%28video%29">mash-up</a> video of the theme of "Single Ladies" and "<a href="The%20Andy%20Griffith%20Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a>" circulated on the Internet in early 2010. It was produced by <a href="Party%20Ben">Party Ben</a> at the end of 2008. In July 2010, the line "Put a Ring on It" was used by the <a href="Joint%20United%20Nations%20Programme%20on%20HIV/AIDS">Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> as the tagline for a female condom public awareness campaign in the US. The song appears in the <a href="Marvel%20Studios">Marvel Studios</a> film "<a href="Doctor%20Strange%20%282016%20film%29">Doctor Strange</a>". The song was featured in the 2016 rhythm game "<a href="Just%20Dance%202017">Just Dance 2017</a>".

Singers and bands of various genres have covered the song in their own style. Scottish band <a href="Marmaduke%20Duke">Marmaduke Duke</a> performed a cover version in April 2009 on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s "<a href="Live%20Lounge">Live Lounge</a>" show. In October 2009, it was released on "<a href="Radio%201%27s%20Live%20Lounge%20%E2%80%93%20Volume%204">Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 4</a>", a compilation of "Live Lounge" recordings. Australian singer <a href="Stan%20Walker">Stan Walker</a> sang a jazzier version of the song on the <a href="Australian%20Idol%20%28season%207%29">seventh series</a> of "<a href="Australian%20Idol">Australian Idol</a>" in October 2009. The same year, elementary school group <a href="PS22%20chorus">PS22 chorus</a> covered "Single Ladies" and "Halo" (2009) during "Billboard"s annual Women In Music luncheon held at <a href="The%20Pierre">The Pierre</a> in New York City. In her short-lived Broadway revue "All About Me" in March 2010, <a href="Dame%20Edna%20Everage">Dame Edna Everage</a> performed a version of the song with backup dancers Gregory Butler and Jon-Paul Mateo. It was also covered by <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> and British singer-songwriter <a href="Alan%20Pownall">Alan Pownall</a>. According to Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly", Tweedy sang only a few bars; he gave "Single Ladies" an <a href="Acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> feel and recited the rest of the song's lyrics. He performed the hand movements that Beyoncé and her dancers do in the song's video. <a href="Pomplamoose">Pomplamoose</a>, an American <a href="indie%20music">indie music</a> duo consisting of Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn, recorded a cover of "Single Ladies" on video, which makes use of split screens to show Dawn on vocals and Conte playing the instruments. Inspired by the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> <a href="Dogme%2095">Dogme 95</a> movement in cinema, Conte began to record songs on video as a quick way to create "organic and raw" music. They chose "Single Ladies" as they believed that it would help them grow their audience.
During a concert at New York's <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> performed a mash-up of his 1984 songs "<a href="Pop%20Life%20%28Prince%20song%29">Pop Life</a>" and "<a href="I%20Would%20Die%204%20U">I Would Die 4 U</a>", incorporating a <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sample</a> of "Single Ladies".

As stated by a critic writing for the magazine, Bareilles put "a piano-pop" twist on "Single Ladies" and turned it "into a slow, jazzy track, complete with creeping bassline and vocal harmonies".

Overman Committee

The Overman Committee was a special <a href="United%20States%20Congressional%20subcommittee">subcommittee</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> <a href="Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Committee on the Judiciary</a> chaired by <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Lee%20Slater%20Overman">Lee Slater Overman</a>. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it investigated German and <a href="Bolshevism">Bolshevik</a> elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism.

The Committee's final report was released in June 1919. It reported on German <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, Bolshevism, and other "un-American activities" in the United States and on likely effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It described German, but not communist, propaganda efforts. The Committee's report and hearings were instrumental in fostering anti-Bolshevik opinion.

World War I, in which the United States and its allies fought - among other Central Powers - the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, raised concern about the German threat to the United States. The <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and the <a href="Sedition%20Act%20of%201918">Sedition Act of 1918</a> were passed in response.

In the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> party, led by <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, overthrew the Russian monarchy and instituted <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>. Many Americans were worried about the revolution's ideas infiltrating the United States, a phenomenon later named the <a href="First%20Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> of 1919-20.

The Overman Committee was formally an ad-hoc subcommittee of the <a href="Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Committee on the Judiciary</a>, but had no formal name. It was chaired by Senator Lee Slater Overman and also included Senators <a href="Knute%20Nelson">Knute Nelson</a> of Minnesota, <a href="Thomas%20Sterling">Thomas Sterling</a> of South Dakota, <a href="William%20H.%20King">William H. King</a> of Utah, and <a href="Josiah%20O.%20Wolcott">Josiah O. Wolcott</a> of Delaware.

The Committee was authorized by Senate Resolution 307 on September 19, 1918 to investigate charges against the <a href="United%20States%20Brewers%20Association">United States Brewers Association</a> (USBA) and allied interests. Brewing institutions had been largely founded by German immigrants in the mid-19th century, who brought with them knowledge and techniques for brewing beer. The Committee interpreted this mission to mean a general probe into German propaganda and pro-German activities in the United States. Hearings were mandated after <a href="A.%20Mitchell%20Palmer">A. Mitchell Palmer</a>, the federal government's <a href="Alien%20Property%20Custodian">Alien Property Custodian</a> responsible for German-owned property in the U.S., testified in September 1918 that the USBA and the rest of the overwhelmingly German liquor industry harbored pro-German sentiments. He stated that "German brewers of America, in association with the United States Brewers' Association" had attempted "to buy a great newspaper" and "control the government of State and Nation", had generally been "unpatriotic", and had "pro-German sympathies". 
Hearings began September 27, 1918, shortly before the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Nearly four dozen witnesses testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of <a href="Association%20fallacy">guilt by association</a>. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.

Many attacked the BOI's actions. The Committee heard testimony that it had not conducted basic background checks of the accused and had not read source material it presented to the Committee. Committee members criticized its testimony as "purely hearsay". 

On February 4, 1919, the Senate unanimously passed Senator <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Walsh">Thomas J. Walsh</a>'s Senate Resolution 439, expanding the Committee's investigations to include "any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia" and "any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country". This decision followed months of sensational daily press coverage of revolutionary events abroad and Bolshevik meetings and events in the United States, which increased anti-radical public opinion. Reports that some of these meetings were attended by Congressmen caused further outrage. One meeting in particular, held at the Poli Theater in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, was widely controversial because of a speech given by <a href="Albert%20Rhys%20Williams">Albert Rhys Williams</a>, a popular <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a> minister, who allegedly said, "America sooner or later is going to accept the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> Government."

<a href="Archibald%20E.%20Stevenson">Archibald E. Stevenson</a>, a New York attorney with ties to the Justice Department, likely a "volunteer spy", testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work. He said that <a href="anti-war">anti-war</a> and anti-<a href="Conscription">draft</a> <a href="activism">activism</a> during World War I, which he described as "pro-German" activity, had now transformed into propaganda "developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement.". The United States' wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that ruled Russia and threatened America anew. "The Bolsheviki movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans." He cited the propaganda efforts of <a href="John%20Reed%20%28journalist%29">John Reed</a> and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators, "We have found money coming into this country from Russia." Stevenson has been described by historian Regin Schmidt as a "driving force" behind the growth of anti-Bolshevism in the United States.

The final catalyst for the expansion of the investigation was the <a href="Seattle%20General%20Strike">Seattle General Strike</a>, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.

The Overman Committee's hearings on Bolshevism lasted from February 11 to March 10, 1919. More than two dozen witnesses were interviewed. About two-thirds were violently anti-Bolshevik and advocated for military intervention in Russia. Some were refugees of the <a href="Russian%20Diaspora">Russian Diaspora</a>—many former government officials—who left Russia because of Bolshevism. The overriding theme was the social chaos the Revolution had brought, but three sub-themes were also frequent: anti-Americanism among American intelligentsia, the relationship between <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and Communist Russia, and the "nationalization" of women after the Soviet revolution.

Stevenson produced a list of 200—later reduced to 62—alleged communist <a href="professors">professors</a> in the United States. Like lists of names provided during the German propaganda hearings, this list provoked an outcry. Stevenson declared universities to be breeding grounds of <a href="sedition">sedition</a>, and that institutions of higher learning were "festering masses of pure <a href="atheism">atheism</a>" and "the grossest kind of <a href="materialism">materialism</a>". <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Russia">Ambassador to Russia</a> <a href="David%20R.%20Francis">David R. Francis</a> stated that the Bolsheviks were killing everybody "who wears a <a href="clerical%20collar">white collar</a> or who is educated and who is not a Bolshevik."

Another recurring theme at the hearings was the <a href="Jewish%20Bolshevism">relationship between Jews and communists in Russia</a>. One <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> preacher stated that nineteen out of twenty communists were Jews; others said the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> was composed mainly of former <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">East Side</a> New York Jews. However, after criticism from Jewish organizations, Senator Overman clarified that the Committee was discussing "apostate" Jews only, defined by witness George Simons as "one who has given up the faith of his fathers or forefathers."

A third frequent theme was the "free love" and "<a href="nationalization">nationalization</a>" of women allegedly occurring in Soviet Russia. Witnesses described an orgy in which there was no "respect for virtuous women"; others who testified, including those who had been in Russia during the Revolution, denied this. After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the "right to choose from among men", Senator Sterling threw up his hands and declared that this was a negation of "free love". However, another decree was produced stating, "A girl having reached her eighteenth year is to be announced as the property of the state."

The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left</a>, including <a href="anarchists">anarchists</a> and socialists of many types, "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on." Senator <a href="Knute%20Nelson">Knute Nelson</a> of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> responded: "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country." Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.

The Committee's final report detailed its investigations into German propaganda, Bolshevism, and other "un-American activities" in the United States and predicted effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It was endorsed unanimously. Released in June 1919, it was over 35,000 words long, and was compiled by Major Edwin Lowry Humes.

The Committee did little to demonstrate the extent of communist activity in the United States. In its analysis of what would happen if capitalism were overthrown and replaced by communism, it warned of widespread misery and hunger, the confiscation of and nationalization of all property, and the beginning of "a program of terror, fear, extermination, and destruction." Anti-Bolshevik public sentiment surged after release of the report and ensuing publicity.

<a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20von%20Bernstorff">Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff</a>, <a href="Karl%20Boy-Ed">Karl Boy-Ed</a>, <a href="Franz%20von%20Papen">Franz von Papen</a>, Dr. <a href="Heinrich%20Albert">Heinrich Albert</a>, and <a href="Franz%20von%20Rintelen">Franz von Rintelen</a>, among others, were Germans investigated for producing propaganda. All were previously evicted from the United States for being part of a German <a href="espionage">espionage</a> ring. The <a href="United%20States%20Brewers%20Association">United States Brewers Association</a>, the <a href="National%20German-American%20Alliance">National German-American Alliance</a>, and the <a href="Hamburg-American%20steamship%20line">Hamburg-American steamship line</a> were investigated. The final report concluded that these organizations, through financial support, bribes, boycotts, and <a href="coercion">coercion</a>, sought to control the press, elections, and public opinion.

The report described the Communist system in Russia as "a reign of terror unparalleled in the history of modern civilization". It concluded that instituting <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>-<a href="Leninism">Leninism</a> in the United States would result in "the destruction of life and property", the deprivation "of the right to participate in affairs of government", and the "further suppress[ion]" of a "substantial rural portion of the population." Furthermore, there would be an "opening of the doors of all prisons and penitentiaries". It would result in the "seizure and confiscation of the 22,896 newspapers and periodicals in the United States" and "complete control of all banking institutions and their assets". "One of the most appalling and far reaching consequences ... would be found in the confiscation and liquidation of ... life insurance companies." The report also criticized "the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship"; "they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'."

Despite the report's rhetoric and the headlines it produced, the report contained little evidence of communist propaganda in the United States or its effect on American labor.

The report's main recommendations included <a href="deporting">deporting</a> alien radicals and enacting peacetime sedition laws. Other recommendations included strict regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and possession of high explosives; control and regulation of foreign language publications, and the creation of patriotic propaganda.

The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as "assassins and madmen," "human scum," "crime mad," and "beasts." The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Russian Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read:

And one day later:

On the release of the final report, newspapers printed sensational articles with headlines in capital letters: "Red Peril Here", "Plan Bloody Revolution", and "Want Washington Government Overturned."

Critics denounced the Committee as a "propaganda apparatus" to stoke anti-German and anti-Soviet fears, feeding the Red Scare and spreading misinformation about Soviet Russia.

The Committee attracted criticism from the public for its perceived overreach, and especially for publishing the names of those accused of association with communist organizations. One woman from Kentucky wrote to Senator Overman on behalf of her sister, who had been accused by Archibald Stevenson, criticizing the Committee for its "brutal as well as stupid misuse of power" and "gross and cruel injustice to men and women the full peer in intellect, character and patriotism of any member of the United States Senate". The Committee was compared to "a <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">witch hunt</a>" in one exchange with a witness.

The Overman Committee did not achieve any lasting reforms. However, the panel's sensationalism played a decisive role in increasing America's fears during the <a href="First%20Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> of 1919-20. Its investigations served as a blueprint for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a>'s anti-radical <a href="Palmer%20raids">Palmer raids</a> late in the year. These were led by <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> Palmer, whose testimony about German brewers had been the catalyst for the Committee's creation.

On May 1, 1919, a month after the Committee's hearings ended, a bomb was mailed to Overman's home, one of a series of letter bombs sent to prominent Americans in the <a href="1919%20United%20States%20anarchist%20bombings">1919 United States anarchist bombings</a>. It was intercepted before it reached its target.

The Overman Committee was the first of many Congressional committees to investigate communism. In the aftermath of the Overman Committee's report, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> established the <a href="Lusk%20Committee">Lusk Committee</a>, which operated from June 1919 to January 1920, Archibald E. Stevenson was its chief counsel and one of its witnesses. Unlike the Overman Committee, the Lusk Committee was active in raiding suspect organizations.

The Overman Committee was an early forerunner of the better known <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, which was created 20 years later.

Franklin Pierce

Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804 – October 8, 1869) was the 14th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> (1853–1857), a northern <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> who saw the <a href="abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist movement</a> as a fundamental threat to the unity of the nation. He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> and enforcing the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South, setting the stage for Southern secession and the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Pierce was born in <a href="History%20of%20New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, and served in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">Senate</a> until he resigned from the Senate in 1842. His private law practice in New Hampshire was a success, and he was appointed <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Hampshire%23U.S.%20Attorney%20for%20New%20Hampshire">U.S. Attorney</a> for his state in 1845. He took part in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> as a <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the Army. He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the <a href="1852%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1852 Democratic National Convention</a>. He and running mate <a href="William%20R.%20King">William R. King</a> easily defeated the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> ticket of <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> and <a href="William%20Alexander%20Graham">William A. Graham</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">1852 presidential election</a>.

As president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. He was a <a href="Young%20America%20movement">Young America</a> expansionist who signed the <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a> of land from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency. His popularity declined sharply in the <a href="New%20England">Northern states</a> after he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a>, while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">violent conflict</a> over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the <a href="Ostend%20Manifesto">Ostend Manifesto</a> calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. He fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">1856 presidential election</a>, but was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> as he became a vocal critic of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.

Pierce was popular and outgoing, but his family life was a grim affair, with his wife <a href="Jane%20Pierce">Jane</a> suffering from illness and depression for much of her life. All of their children died young, their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce's inauguration. He was a heavy drinker for much of his life, and he died of <a href="cirrhosis%20of%20the%20liver">cirrhosis of the liver</a> in 1869. Historians and scholars generally rank Pierce as one of <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Notable%20scholar%20surveys">the worst</a> and <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Memorability%20of%20the%20presidents">least memorable U.S. Presidents</a>.

Franklin Pierce was born on November 23, 1804 in a log cabin in <a href="Hillsborough%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hillsborough, New Hampshire</a>. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> from <a href="Norwich%2C%20Norfolk">Norwich, Norfolk</a>, England in about 1634. His father <a href="Benjamin%20Pierce%20%28governor%29">Benjamin</a> was a lieutenant in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> who moved from <a href="Chelmsford%2C%20Massachusetts">Chelmsford, Massachusetts</a> to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican</a> state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of his older brothers fought in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>; public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life.

Pierce's father ensured that his sons were educated, and he placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at age 12. The boy, not fond of schooling, grew homesick at Hancock and walked back to his home one Sunday. His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before kicking him out of the carriage and ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm. Pierce later cited this moment as "the turning-point in my life". Later that year, he transferred to <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> to prepare for college. By this time, he had built a reputation as a charming student, sometimes prone to misbehavior.
In fall 1820, Pierce entered <a href="Bowdoin%20College">Bowdoin College</a> in <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Maine">Brunswick, Maine</a>, one of 19 freshmen. He joined the Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside <a href="Jonathan%20Cilley">Jonathan Cilley</a> (later elected to Congress) and <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>, with whom he formed lasting friendships. He was the last in his class after two years, but he worked hard to improve his grades and graduated in fifth place in 1824 in a graduating class of 14. <a href="John%20P.%20Hale">John P. Hale</a> enrolled at Bowdoin in Pierce's junior year; he became a political ally of Pierce's and then his rival. Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company called the Bowdoin Cadets during his junior year, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house, until the noise caused him to demand that it halt. The students rebelled and went on strike, an event that Pierce was suspected of leading. During his final year at Bowdoin, he spent several months teaching at a school in rural <a href="Hebron%2C%20Maine">Hebron, Maine</a>, where he earned his first salary and his students included future Congressman <a href="John%20J.%20Perry">John J. Perry</a>.

Pierce <a href="read%20law">read law</a> briefly with former New Hampshire Governor <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a>, a family friend in <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a>. He then spent a semester at <a href="Northampton%20Law%20School">Northampton Law School</a> in <a href="Northampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Northampton, Massachusetts</a>, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in <a href="Amherst%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Amherst, New Hampshire</a>. He was admitted to the New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. He lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of <a href="Mary%20Baker%20Eddy">Mary Baker Eddy</a>.

By 1824, New Hampshire was a hotbed of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and <a href="Isaac%20Hill">Isaac Hill</a> laying the groundwork for a party of Democrats in support of General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. They opposed the established <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalists</a> (and their successors, the <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republicans</a>), who were led by sitting President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828 presidential election</a> between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election, as Hillsborough <a href="Town%20meeting%23Traditional%20town%20meetings">town moderator</a>, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.

Pierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20New%20Hampshire%2C%201828">lost New Hampshire</a>. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20House%20of%20Representatives">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a>. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.

Like all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45, Pierce was a member of the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Army%20National%20Guard">state militia</a>, and was appointed <a href="aide%20de%20camp">aide de camp</a> to Governor <a href="Samuel%20Dinsmoor">Samuel Dinsmoor</a> in 1831. He remained in the militia until 1847, and attained the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> before becoming a <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> during the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the years of peace following the War of 1812, Pierce worked with <a href="Alden%20Partridge">Alden Partridge</a>, president of <a href="Norwich%20University">Norwich University</a>, a military college in <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, and <a href="Truman%20B.%20Ransom">Truman B. Ransom</a> and <a href="Alonzo%20Jackman">Alonzo Jackman</a>, Norwich faculty members and militia officers, to increase recruiting efforts and improve training and readiness. Pierce served as a Norwich University trustee from 1841 to 1859, and received the <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> of <a href="Legum%20Doctor">LL.D.</a> from Norwich in 1853.

In late 1832, the Democratic Party convention nominated Pierce for one of New Hampshire's five seats in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. This was <a href="tantamount%20to%20election">tantamount to election</a> for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whigs</a> had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">Jackson's landslide re-election that year</a>. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, but he would not be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.

On November 19, 1834, Pierce married <a href="Jane%20Pierce">Jane Means Appleton</a> (March 12, 1806 – December 2, 1863), the daughter of <a href="Jesse%20Appleton">Jesse Appleton</a>, a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational</a> minister and former president of Bowdoin College, and Elizabeth Means. The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane Pierce was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-<a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a>, encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.

Jane Pierce disliked Hillsborough as well, and in 1838, the Pierces relocated to the state capital, <a href="Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Concord, New Hampshire</a>. They had three sons, all of whom died in childhood. Franklin Jr. (February 2–5, 1836) died in infancy, while Frank Robert (August 27, 1839 – November 14, 1843) died at the age of four from <a href="epidemic%20typhus">epidemic typhus</a>. Benjamin (April 13, 1841 – January 6, 1853) <a href="Andover%2C%20Massachusetts%23Death%20of%20President-elect%20Franklin%20Pierce%27s%20son">died at the age of 11</a> <a href="%23Tragedy%20and%20transition">in a train accident</a>.

Pierce departed in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., where the <a href="Twenty-third%20United%20States%20Congress">Twenty-third United States Congress</a> convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second term was under way, and the House had a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements the responsibility of the states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the <a href="Twenty-fourth%20United%20States%20Congress">Twenty-fourth Congress</a>.

As <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionism</a> grew more vocal in the mid-1830s, Congress was inundated with petitions from anti-slavery groups seeking legislation to restrict slavery in the United States. From the beginning, Pierce found the abolitionists' "agitation" to be an annoyance, and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states' rights, even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself. He was also frustrated with the "religious bigotry" of abolitionists, who cast their political opponents as sinners. "I consider slavery a social and political evil," Pierce said, "and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth." Still, he wrote in December 1835, "One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man. This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union."

When Rep. <a href="James%20Henry%20Hammond">James Henry Hammond</a> of South Carolina looked to prevent anti-slavery petitions from reaching the House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported what came to be known as the <a href="21st%20Rule">gag rule</a>, which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836. He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery "Herald of Freedom" as a "<a href="doughface">doughface</a>", which had the dual meaning of "craven-spirited man" and "northerner with southern sympathies". Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the "Herald of Freedom" article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one-in-33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a> read the article on the Senate floor as "proof" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one-in-33 figure.

The resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who had been elected governor of New Hampshire, left a short-term opening to be filled by the state legislature, and with Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose <a href="John%20Page%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">John Page</a> to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce was elected to the full term, to commence in March 1837, and at age 32, was at the time one of the youngest members in Senate history. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while his wife also continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring for him a <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a> as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.

Pierce voted the party line on most issues and was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the <a href="Great%20Triumvirate">Great Triumvirate</a> of Calhoun, <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, who dominated the Senate. Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis, as the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a> had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst "the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation". So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> and his plan to create an <a href="Independent%20Treasury">independent treasury</a>, a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation. Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade.

One topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the <a href="Twenty-sixth%20United%20States%20Congress">Twenty-sixth Congress</a> (1839–1841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.

Pierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren's re-election in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 presidential election</a>. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the <a href="Twenty-seventh%20United%20States%20Congress">Twenty-seventh Congress</a>. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time. New Hampshire Democrats insisted that their state's U. S. senators be limited to one six-year term, so he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice. His last actions in the Senate in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states – believing that the money should go to the military instead – and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">New York Customs House</a>, where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.

Despite his resignation from the Senate, Pierce had no intention of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane Pierce a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with <a href="Asa%20Fowler">Asa Fowler</a> during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce attracted large audiences in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.

Pierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party, which was split by several issues. Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical "<a href="Locofocos">locofoco</a>" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper—Hill lost, and founded his own paper, of which Pierce was a frequent target.

In June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee, and in the following year's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature. The party remained divided on several issues, including railroad development and the <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a>, and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences. His priorities were "order, moderation, compromise, and party unity", which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues. As he would as president, Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly, and saw the opposition to slavery as a threat to that.

Democratic <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>'s <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a> victory in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844 presidential election</a> was welcome news to Pierce, who had befriended the former <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> while both served in Congress. Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election, and in turn Polk appointed him as <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Hampshire%23U.S.%20Attorney%20for%20New%20Hampshire">United States Attorney for New Hampshire</a>. Polk's most prominent cause was the <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annexation of Texas</a>, an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale, now a U.S. Representative. Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a public letter to his constituents outlining his opposition to the measure. Pierce responded by re-assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale's nomination for another term in Congress. The political firestorm led to Pierce severing ties with his longtime friend, and with his law partner Fowler, who was a Hale supporter. Hale refused to withdraw, and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire, the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat. Eventually, the Whigs and Hale's <a href="Independent%20Democrat">Independent Democrat</a>s took control of the legislature, elected Whig <a href="Anthony%20Colby">Anthony Colby</a> as governor and sent Hale to the Senate, much to Pierce's anger.

Active military service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly his older brother <a href="Benjamin%20Kendrick%20Pierce">Benjamin</a>'s, as well as that of <a href="John%20McNeil%20Jr.">John McNeil Jr.</a>, husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>. General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>'s advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> proposed capturing the port of <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Vera Cruz</a> and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed commander and colonel of the <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">9th Infantry Regiment</a> in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> and second-in-command.
On March 3, 1847, Pierce was promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>, and took command of a <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies for Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, in time for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Contreras">Battle of Contreras</a>. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and debilitating his knee. The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, "General Pierce is a damned coward." Pierce returned for the following day's action, but re-injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men; by the time he caught up, the battle was mostly won.

As the <a href="Battle%20of%20Churubusco">Battle of Churubusco</a> approached, Scott ordered Pierce to the rear to convalesce. He responded, "For God's sake, General, this is the last great battle, and I must lead my brigade." Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign, eventually taking part in the <a href="Battle%20for%20Mexico%20City">capture of Mexico City</a> in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. For much of the Mexico City battle, he was in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city; while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, he also tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.

Pierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state, and submitted his resignation from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long shadow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.

<a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war, countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs, written several years after Pierce's death: "Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage. I was not a supporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals."

Returning to Concord, Pierce resumed his law practice; in one notable case he defended the religious liberty of the <a href="Shakers">Shakers</a>, the insular sect threatened with legal action over accusations of abuse. His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.

The large <a href="Mexican%20Cession">Mexican Cession</a> of land divided the United States politically, with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and offering the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a> to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> line of <a href="Parallel%2036%C2%B030%E2%80%B2%20north">36°30′ N</a>. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy split the Democrats. At the <a href="1848%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1848 Democratic National Convention</a>, the majority nominated former Michigan senator <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> for president, while a minority broke off to become the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil <a href="ticket%20%28politics%29">ticket</a>, and was so effective that Taylor, who was <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">elected president</a>, was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.

Senator Henry Clay, a Whig, hoped to put the slavery question to rest with a set of proposals that became known as the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>. These would give victories to North and South, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the bill stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> led a successful effort to split it into separate measures so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package. The bills passed, and were signed by President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> (who had succeeded Taylor after the president's death earlier in 1850). Pierce strongly supported the compromise, giving a well-received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to "The Union! Eternal Union!" The same month, the Democratic candidate for governor, John Atwood, issued a letter opposing the Compromise, and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket. The fiasco compromised the election for the Democrats, who lost several races; still, Pierce's party retained its control over the state, and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election.

As the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">1852 presidential election</a> approached, the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue, though most of the <a href="Barnburners%20and%20Hunkers%23Barnburners">"Barnburners"</a> who had left the party with Van Buren to form the Free Soil Party had returned. It was widely expected that the <a href="1852%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1852 Democratic National Convention</a> would result in deadlock, with no major candidate able to win the necessary two-thirds majority. New Hampshire Democrats, including Pierce, supported his old teacher, Levi Woodbury, by then an <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice of the Supreme Court</a>, as a compromise candidate, but Woodbury's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk. New Hampshire Democrats felt that, as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities, they should supply the presidential candidate. Other possible standard-bearers included Douglas, Cass, <a href="William%20Marcy">William Marcy</a> of New York, <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> of Pennsylvania, <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> of Texas, and <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a> of Missouri.

Despite home state support, Pierce faced obstacles to his nomination, since he had been out of office for a decade, and also lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be "utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected, he knew his future influence depended on his availability to run. Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act">Fugitive Slave Act</a>.

The convention assembled on June 1 in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, and the deadlock occurred as expected. On the first ballot of the 288 delegates, held on June 3, Cass claimed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were scattered, without a single vote for Pierce. The next 34 ballots passed with no winner even close, and still no votes for Pierce. The Buchanan team then had their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate Buchanan's inevitability, and unite the convention behind him. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third place. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman <a href="James%20C.%20Dobbin">James C. Dobbin</a> delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator <a href="William%20R.%20King">William R. King</a>, a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a>, and adopted a <a href="party%20platform">party platform</a> that rejected further "agitation" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.

When word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.
The Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce's commander in Mexico; his running mate was <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="William%20Alexander%20Graham">William A. Graham</a>. The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen <a href="voter%20turnout">voter turnout</a> to its lowest level since <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201836">1836</a>; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was "one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history". Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>" editor <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, "we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it".
Pierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign. It was the custom at the time for candidates to not appear to seek the office, and he did no personal campaigning. Pierce's opponents caricatured him as an anti-Catholic coward and alcoholic ("the hero of many a well-fought bottle"). Scott, meanwhile, drew weak support from the Whigs, who were torn by their pro-Compromise platform and found him to be an abysmal, gaffe-prone public speaker. The Democrats were confident: a popular slogan was that the Democrats "will "pierce" their enemies in 1852 as they "poked" [that is, <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">Polked</a>] them in 1844." This proved to be true, as Scott won only Kentucky, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Vermont, finishing with 42 electoral votes to Pierce's 254. With 3.2 million votes cast, Pierce won the popular vote with 50.9 to 44.1 percent. A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce's in-state rival, Hale, who won 4.9 percent of the popular vote. The Democrats took large majorities in Congress.

Pierce began his presidency in mourning. Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the President-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an <a href="embankment%20%28transportation%29">embankment</a> near <a href="Andover%2C%20Massachusetts">Andover, Massachusetts</a>. Both Franklin and Jane Pierce survived, but in the wreckage found their only remaining son, 11-year-old Benjamin, crushed to death, his body nearly decapitated. Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from his wife. They both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president. Jane Pierce wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband's pursuit and acceptance of high office. She wrote a lengthy letter of apology to "Benny" for her failings as a mother. She avoided social functions for much of her first two years as <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a>, making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the annual public reception held at the White House on New Year's Day, 1855.

When Franklin Pierce departed New Hampshire for the inauguration, Jane Pierce chose to remain. Pierce, then the youngest man to be elected president, chose to <a href="Affirmation%20in%20law">affirm</a> his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his <a href="Inauguration%20Day">inaugural address</a> from memory. In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the "eminently important" acquisition of new territories. "The policy of my Administration", said the new president, "will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion." Avoiding the word "slavery", he emphasized his desire to put the "important subject" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, "You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength."

In his <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">Cabinet</a> appointments, Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most in the party had not originally supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.

All of Pierce's cabinet nominations were unanimously and immediately confirmed by the Senate. Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.

Factionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or "Hards" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or "Softs".
Buchanan had urged Pierce to consult Vice President-elect King in selecting the Cabinet, but Pierce did not do so—Pierce and King had not communicated since they had been selected as candidates in June 1852. By the start of 1853, King was severely ill with tuberculosis, and went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy. This extended vacancy meant that for nearly the entirety of Pierce's presidency the <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate President pro tempore</a>, initially <a href="David%20Atchison">David Atchison</a> of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.

Pierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of <a href="United%20States%20federal%20civil%20service">civil service</a> examinations which was a forerunner to the <a href="Pendleton%20Act">Pendleton Act</a> passed three decades later. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Department</a> was reformed by Secretary <a href="Robert%20McClelland%20%28American%20politician%29">Robert McClelland</a>, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Justice Department</a>. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a>, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.

Pierce charged <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a> with reforming the <a href="United%20States%20Treasury">Treasury</a>, which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, many of whom were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury, large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.

<a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, at Pierce's request, led surveys by the <a href="Corps%20of%20Topographical%20Engineers">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a> of possible transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt that such a project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including the expansion of the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> and building of the <a href="Washington%20Monument">Washington Monument</a>.

The Pierce administration aligned with the expansionist <a href="Young%20America%20movement">Young America</a> movement, with <a href="William%20L.%20Marcy">William L. Marcy</a> leading the charge as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American, republican image. He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear "the simple dress of an American citizen" instead of the elaborate <a href="diplomatic%20uniform">diplomatic uniform</a>s worn in the courts of Europe, and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates. Marcy received international praise for his 73-page letter defending Austrian refugee <a href="Martin%20Koszta">Martin Koszta</a>, who had been captured abroad in mid-1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen.

Davis, an advocate of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate <a href="James%20Gadsden">James Gadsden</a> to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating the provisions of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by <a href="William%20Walker%20%28filibuster%29">William Walker</a>'s <a href="filibuster%20%28military%29">unauthorized expedition</a> into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a> to the region now comprising southern <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15 million to $10 million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse the final version of the treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a> to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.
Relations with the United Kingdom were tense, as American fishermen felt menaced by the British navy's increasing enforcement of Canadian waters. Marcy completed a <a href="trade%20agreement">trade reciprocity agreement</a> with British minister to Washington, <a href="Sir%20John%20Crampton%2C%202nd%20Baronet">John Crampton</a>, which reduced the need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the <a href="Clayton%E2%80%93Bulwer%20Treaty">Clayton–Bulwer Treaty</a> of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.

British consuls in the United States sought to enlist Americans for the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in 1854, in violation of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">message to Congress</a> Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.

Pierce's administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U.S. diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> from Spain for $120 million (USD), and justify the "wresting" of it from Spain if the offer were refused. The publication of the <a href="Ostend%20Manifesto">Ostend Manifesto</a>, which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy, provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession to bolster Southern interests. It helped discredit the expansionist policy of <a href="Manifest%20Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> the Democratic Party had often supported.

Pierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military. Secretary of War Davis and Navy Secretary James C. Dobbin found the Army and Navy in poor condition, with insufficient forces, a reluctance to adopt new technology, and inefficient management. Under the Pierce administration, Commodore <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Matthew C. Perry</a> <a href="Perry%20Expedition">visited Japan</a> (a venture originally planned under Fillmore) in an effort to expand trade to the East. Perry wanted to encroach on Asia by force, but Pierce and Dobbin pushed him to remain diplomatic. Perry signed a modest trade treaty with the Japanese <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">shogunate</a> which was successfully ratified. The 1856 launch of the <a href="USS%20Merrimack%20%281855%29">USS "Merrimac"</a>, one of six newly commissioned <a href="steam%20frigate">steam frigate</a>s, was one of Pierce's "most personally satisfying" days in office.

The greatest challenge to the country's equilibrium during the Pierce administration was the passage of the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a>. <a href="organized%20territory">Organizing</a> the largely unsettled <a href="Nebraska%20Territory">Nebraska Territory</a>, which stretched from <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> to the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, and from Texas north to what is now the Canada–US border, was a crucial part of Douglas's plans for western expansion. He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> to California, through the vast western territory. Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come, in part, from the South. Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers <a href="Popular%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">decide whether to allow slavery</a>. This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of it was north of the 36°30′ N line the Missouri Compromise deemed "free". The territory would be split into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas</a>, and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not. In the view of pro-slavery <a href="U.S.%20Southern%20states">Southern</a> politicians, the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of <a href="California">California</a>, including territory south of the compromise line, as a free state.

Pierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> and Massachusetts's <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.
Pierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and ultimately defined the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the <a href="Know%20Nothing">Know Nothing</a>s, and the founding of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>.

Even as the act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a>. Thousands of pro-slavery <a href="Border%20Ruffians">Border Ruffians</a> came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When <a href="Free-Stater%20%28Kansas%29">Free-Staters</a> set up a shadow government, and drafted the <a href="Topeka%20Constitution">Topeka Constitution</a>, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the <a href="Topeka%2C%20Kansas">Topeka</a> government.

Passage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave <a href="Anthony%20Burns">Anthony Burns</a> in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns's return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.

The midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as well as to the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party.

Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.

When balloting began on June 5 at the convention in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of "unqualified approbation" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>, as the vice-presidential nominee. This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.

Pierce endorsed Buchanan, though the two remained distant; he hoped to resolve the Kansas situation by November to improve the Democrats' chances in the general election. He installed <a href="John%20W.%20Geary">John W. Geary</a> as territorial governor, who drew the ire of pro-slavery legislators. Geary was able to restore order in Kansas, though the electoral damage had already been done—Republicans used "Bleeding Kansas" and "Bleeding Sumner" (the brutal <a href="caning%20of%20Charles%20Sumner">caning of Charles Sumner</a> by South Carolina Representative <a href="Preston%20Brooks">Preston Brooks</a> in the Senate chamber) as election slogans. The Buchanan/Breckinridge ticket was elected, but the Democratic percentage of the popular vote in the North fell from 49.8 percent in 1852 to 41.4 in 1856 as Buchanan won only five of sixteen free states (Pierce had won fourteen), and in three of those, Buchanan won because of a split between the Republican candidate, former California senator <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> and the Know Nothing, former president Fillmore.

Pierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination. In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations. In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted. It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought. Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4, 1857, the only time in U.S. history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four-year term.

After leaving the White House, the Pierces remained in Washington for more than two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and followed by tours of Europe and the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.

Pierce never lost sight of politics during his travels, commenting regularly on the nation's growing sectional conflict. He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would "not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely", but "within our own borders in our own streets". He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their "heresy and treason". The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during <a href="Lincoln-Douglas%20debates">his debates</a> with Republican Senate candidate <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> in 1858, Douglas called the former president "a man of integrity and honor".

As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">defeated</a> for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.

After efforts to prevent the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> ended with the firing on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. "I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war," Pierce wrote to his wife. Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of <a href="habeas%20corpus%20in%20the%20United%20States">"habeas corpus"</a>, arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging <a href="Copperheads%20%28politics%29">Northern Peace Democrats</a>, but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.

In September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others. A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>, accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people, and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president. Later that month, the pro-administration "<a href="Detroit%20Tribune">Detroit Tribune</a>" printed an item calling Pierce "a prowling traitor spy", and intimating that he was a member of the pro-Confederate <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20Golden%20Circle">Knights of the Golden Circle</a>. No such conspiracy existed, but a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the "Tribune" a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, indicating that "President P." was part of a plot against the Union. Hopkins intended for the "Tribune" to make the charges public, at which point Hopkins would admit authorship, thus making the "Tribune" editors seem overly partisan and gullible. Instead, the "Tribune" editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials. Seward then ordered the arrest of possible "traitors" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax, but despite this, Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true. Pierce denied them, and Seward hastily backtracked. Later, Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax, and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly. When Seward refused to make their correspondence public, Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally, California's <a href="Milton%20Latham">Milton Latham</a>, read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the administration's embarrassment.

The institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat <a href="Clement%20Vallandigham">Clement Vallandigham</a> further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a>. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.

Jane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by the death of his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne in May 1864; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 presidential election</a> unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of <a href="Lincoln%27s%20assassination">Lincoln's assassination</a> in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.

Pierce's drinking impaired his health in his last years, but he grew increasingly spiritual. He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid-1865. During this time, he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis, now a prisoner at <a href="Fortress%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a> in Virginia. He also offered financial help to Hawthorne's son Julian, as well as to his own nephews. On the second anniversary of Jane's death, Pierce was baptized into his wife's <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal</a> faith at St. Paul's Church in Concord. He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination, which had alienated Democrats with anti-slavery rhetoric. He took up the life of an "old farmer", as he called himself, buying up property, drinking less, farming the land himself, and hosting visiting relatives. He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at <a href="Little%20Boar%27s%20Head%20Historic%20District">Little Boar's Head</a> on the coast, sometimes visiting Jane's relatives in Massachusetts. Still interested in politics, he expressed support for <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> policy and supported the president's acquittal in his <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeachment trial</a>; he later expressed optimism for Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant.
Pierce's health began to decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver, knowing he would not recover. A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35 am on October 8. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's <a href="Old%20North%20Cemetery%20%28Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire%29">Old North Cemetery</a>.

In his last <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>, which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to $ today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.

In addition to his LL.D. from Norwich University, Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College (1853) and <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> (1860).

Two places in New Hampshire have been listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> specifically because of their association with Pierce. The <a href="Franklin%20Pierce%20Homestead">Franklin Pierce Homestead</a> in Hillsborough is a state park and a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, open to the public. The <a href="Franklin%20Pierce%20House%20%28South%20Main%20Street%2C%20Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire%29">Franklin Pierce House</a> in Concord, where Pierce died, was destroyed by fire in 1981, but is nevertheless listed on the register. The <a href="Pierce%20Manse">Pierce Manse</a>, his Concord home from 1842 to 1848, is open seasonally and maintained by a volunteer group, "The Pierce Brigade".

Several institutions and places have been named after Pierce, many in New Hampshire:


After Pierce died, he mostly passed from the American consciousness, except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">worst presidents in American history</a>. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.

Historian <a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a> says, "His administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in American history. It witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the Age of Jackson"

Biographer <a href="Roy%20Nichols">Roy Nichols</a> argues:

As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.

Despite a reputation as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and as a threat to the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme positions or opposed northern interests.

David Potter concludes that the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were "the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration  ... Both brought down an avalanche of public criticism." More important, says Potter, they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and "popular sovereignty" as political doctrines. Historian Kenneth Nivison, writing in 2010, takes a more favorable view of Pierce's foreign policy, stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who served at a time when America had the military might to make her desires stick. "American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s, which eventually supplanted European colonialism by the middle of the twentieth century, owed much to the paternalism of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce."

Historian Larry Gara, who authored a book on Pierce's presidency, wrote in the former president's entry in "American National Biography Online":

He was president at a time that called for almost superhuman skills, yet he lacked such skills and never grew into the job to which he had been elected. His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the <a href="Guano%20Islands%20Act">Guano Islands Act</a>]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.

Millard Fillmore

Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 – March 8, 1874) was the 13th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> (1850–1853), and the last to be a member of the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> while in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. A former U.S. Representative from New York, Fillmore was elected the nation's 12th <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> in <a href="1848%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">1848</a>, and succeeded to the presidency in July 1850 upon the death of President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>. He was instrumental in getting the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> passed, a bargain that led to a brief truce in the battle over <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>. He failed to win the Whig nomination for president in 1852; he gained the endorsement of the <a href="nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a> four years later, and finished third in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">that election</a>.

Fillmore was born into poverty in the <a href="Finger%20Lakes">Finger Lakes</a> area of <a href="New%20York%20state">New York state</a>—his parents were tenant farmers during his formative years. Though he had little formal schooling, he rose from poverty through diligent study and became a successful attorney. He became prominent in the <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a> area as an attorney and politician, was elected to the <a href="New%20York%20Assembly">New York Assembly</a> in 1828, and to the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in 1832. Initially, he belonged to the <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a>, but became a Whig as the party formed in the mid-1830s; he was a rival for state party leadership with editor <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a> and Weed's protégé, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>. Through his career, Fillmore declared slavery an evil, but one beyond the powers of the federal government, whereas Seward was not only openly hostile to slavery, he argued that the federal government had a role to play in ending it. Fillmore was an unsuccessful candidate for <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> when the Whigs took control of the chamber in 1841, but was made <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a> chairman. Defeated in bids for the Whig nomination for vice president in 1844, and for New York governor the same year, Fillmore was elected <a href="Comptroller%20of%20New%20York">Comptroller of New York</a> in 1847, the first to hold that post by direct election.

As vice president, Fillmore was largely ignored by Taylor, even in the dispensing of patronage in New York, on which Taylor consulted Weed and Seward. In his capacity as President of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> however, he presided over angry debates in the Senate as Congress decided whether to allow slavery in the <a href="Mexican%20Cession">Mexican Cession</a>. Fillmore supported <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>'s Omnibus Bill (the basis of the 1850 Compromise) though Taylor did not. Upon becoming president in July 1850, Fillmore dismissed Taylor's cabinet and carried out his own policy priorities. He began by exerting pressure on Congress to pass the Compromise, highlighting how it gave legislative victories to both North and Souththe five-bill package was approved and then enacted into law that September. The <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, expediting the return of escaped slaves to those who claimed ownership, was a controversial part of the Compromise, and Fillmore felt himself duty-bound to enforce it, though it damaged his popularity and also the Whig Party, which was torn North from South. In foreign policy, Fillmore supported <a href="Perry%20Expedition">U.S. Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan</a>, opposed <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French</a> designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by <a href="Narciso%20L%C3%B3pez">Narciso López's</a> filibuster expeditions to Cuba. He sought election to a full term in 1852, but was passed over by the Whigs in favor of <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>.

As the Whig Party broke up after Fillmore's presidency, many in Fillmore's conservative wing joined the Know Nothings, forming the American Party. In his 1856 candidacy as that party's nominee, Fillmore had little to say about immigration, focusing instead on the preservation of the Union, and won only Maryland. In retirement, Fillmore was active in many civic endeavors—he helped in founding the <a href="University%20of%20Buffalo">University of Buffalo</a> and served as its first chancellor. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was critical of the war policies of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. After peace was restored, he supported the <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> policies of President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>. Though he is relatively obscure today, Fillmore has been praised by some, for his foreign policy, and criticized by others, for his enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act and his association with the Know Nothings. Historians and scholars have <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">consistently ranked</a> Fillmore as one of the worst presidents.

Millard Fillmore was born January 7, 1800 in a <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>, on a farm in what is now <a href="Moravia%2C%20New%20York">Moravia</a>, <a href="Cayuga%20County%2C%20New%20York">Cayuga County</a>, in the <a href="Finger%20Lakes">Finger Lakes</a> region of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. His parents were Phoebe (Millard) and <a href="Nathaniel%20Fillmore">Nathaniel Fillmore</a>—he was the second of eight children and the oldest son. Nathaniel Fillmore was the son of Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. (1739–1814), a native of <a href="Franklin%2C%20Connecticut">Franklin, Connecticut</a> who became one of the earliest settlers of <a href="Bennington%2C%20Vermont">Bennington</a> when it was founded in the territory then called the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Grants">New Hampshire Grants</a>. 

Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard moved from Vermont in 1799, seeking better opportunities than were available on Nathaniel's stony farm, but the title to their Cayuga County land proved defective, and the Fillmore family moved to nearby <a href="Sempronius%2C%20New%20York">Sempronius</a>, where they leased land as tenant farmers, and Nathaniel occasionally taught school. Historian Tyler Anbinder described Fillmore's childhood as, "...one of hard work, frequent privation, and virtually no formal schooling".

Over time, Nathaniel became more successful in Sempronius, though during Millard’s formative years the family endured severe poverty. Nathaniel became sufficiently regarded that he was chosen to serve in local offices including justice of the peace. In hopes his oldest son would learn a trade, he convinced Millard at age 14 not to enlist for the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> and <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a>d him to cloth maker Benjamin Hungerford in <a href="Sparta%2C%20New%20York">Sparta</a>. Fillmore was relegated to menial labor; unhappy at not learning any skills, he left Hungerford's employ. His father then placed him in the same trade at a mill in <a href="Niles%2C%20New%20York">New Hope</a>. Seeking to better himself, Millard bought a share in a circulating library, and read all the books he could. In 1819, he took advantage of idle time at the mill to enroll at a new academy in the town, where he met a classmate, <a href="Abigail%20Fillmore">Abigail Powers</a>, and fell in love with her.

Later in 1819, Nathaniel moved the family to Montville, a hamlet of <a href="Moravia%2C%20New%20York">Moravia</a>. Appreciating his son's talents, Nathaniel followed his wife's advice and persuaded Judge Walter Wood, the Fillmores' landlord and the wealthiest person in the area, to allow Millard to be his law clerk for a trial period. Wood agreed to employ young Fillmore, and to supervise him as he <a href="read%20law">read law</a>. Fillmore earned money teaching school for three months and bought out his mill apprenticeship. He left Wood after 18 months—the judge paid him almost nothing, and the two quarreled after Fillmore, unaided, earned a small sum advising a farmer in a minor lawsuit. Refusing to pledge not to do it again, Fillmore gave up his clerkship. Nathaniel again moved the family, and Millard accompanied them west to <a href="East%20Aurora%2C%20New%20York">East Aurora</a>, in <a href="Erie%20County%2C%20New%20York">Erie County</a>, near <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>., where Nathaniel purchased a farm which became prosperous. 

In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and reached emancipation. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted a few cases in justice of the peace courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year and continued his study of law—first while teaching school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary. At that time he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was <a href="Admission%20to%20practice%20law">admitted</a> to the New York bar, declined offers from Buffalo law firms, and returned to East Aurora to establish a practice as the town's only residing lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed, and later had two children, <a href="Millard%20Powers%20Fillmore">Millard Powers Fillmore</a> (1828–1889) and <a href="Mary%20Abigail%20Fillmore">Mary Abigail Fillmore</a> (1832–1854).

Other members of the Fillmore family were active in politics and government in addition to Nathaniel’s service as a justice of the peace. Millard’s grandfather, Nathaniel Sr., served in local offices in Bennington—as <a href="Hayward%20%28profession%29">hayward</a>, highway surveyor, and tax collector. Millard then also became interested in politics—the rise of the <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a> in the late 1820s provided his initial attraction and entry.

Many Anti-Masons were opposed to the presidential candidacy of General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, a <a href="Mason%20%28Freemasonry%29">Mason</a>, and Fillmore was a delegate to the New York convention that endorsed President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> for re-election, and served as well at two Anti-Masonic conventions in the summer of 1828. At the conventions, Fillmore and one of the early political bosses, newspaper editor <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>, met and impressed each other. By then, Fillmore was the leading citizen in East Aurora, successfully sought election to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a>, and served in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a> for three one-year terms (1829 to 1831). Fillmore's 1828 election was in contrast to the victories of the <a href="Jacksonian%20democracy">Jacksonian Democrats</a> (soon the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>), who swept the general into the White House and their party to a majority in Albany—thus Fillmore was in the minority in the Assembly. He proved effective anyway, promoting legislation to provide court witnesses the option of taking a non-religious oath, and in 1830 abolishing <a href="imprisonment%20for%20debt">imprisonment for debt</a>. By then, much of Fillmore's legal practice was in Buffalo and later that year he moved there with his family; he did not seek re-election in 1831.

Fillmore was also successful as a lawyer. Buffalo was then in a period of rapid expansion, recovering from British conflagration during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and becoming the western terminus of the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a>. Court cases from outside Erie County began falling to Fillmore's lot, and he reached prominence as a lawyer in Buffalo before he moved there. He took lifelong friend <a href="Nathan%20K.%20Hall">Nathan K. Hall</a> as a law clerk in East Aurora—Hall became Fillmore's partner in Buffalo and his <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">postmaster general</a> as president. Buffalo was legally a village when Fillmore arrived, and although the bill to incorporate it as a city passed the legislature after Fillmore had left the Assembly, he helped draft the city charter. In addition to his legal practice, Fillmore helped found the Buffalo High School Association, joined the <a href="lyceum">lyceum</a> and attended the local Unitarian church; he became a leading citizen of Buffalo. He was also active in the <a href="New%20York%20Army%20National%20Guard">New York Militia</a>, and attained the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> as inspector of the 47th Brigade.

In 1832 Fillmore ran for the House of Representatives and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a>, former Attorney General, won only Vermont, as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December, and so Fillmore had to wait more than a year after his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation on which to build a national party, and formed the broad-based <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> from <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republicans</a>, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> and federally funded <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who disliked slavery but considered the federal government powerless over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> of <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn</a>, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.

In Washington, Fillmore urged the expansion of Buffalo harbor, a decision under federal jurisdiction, and privately lobbied Albany for the expansion of the state-owned Erie Canal. Even during the 1832 campaign, Fillmore's affiliation as an Anti-Mason had been uncertain, and he rapidly shed the label once sworn in. Fillmore came to the notice of the influential Massachusetts senator <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, who took the new congressman under his wing. Fillmore became a firm supporter and the close relationship between the two would continue until Webster's death late in Fillmore's presidency. Despite Fillmore's support of the Second Bank as a means of national development, he did not speak in the congressional debates in which some advocated renewing its charter, although Jackson had previously vetoed legislation for a charter renewal. Fillmore supported building infrastructure, voting in favor of constructing a bridge across the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> and navigation improvements on the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson</a>.

Anti-Masonry was still strong in Western New York though it was petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not nominate him for a second term in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.

Van Buren, faced with the economic <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>, caused in part by lack of confidence in private bank note issues after Jackson had instructed the government <a href="Specie%20Circular">to only accept gold or silver</a>, called a special session of Congress. Government money had been held in so-called "<a href="pet%20banks">pet banks</a>" since Jackson had withdrawn it from the Second Bank; Van Buren proposed to place funds in sub-treasuries, government depositories that would not lend money. Believing that government funds should be lent to develop the country, Fillmore felt this would lock the nation's limited supply of gold money away from commerce. Van Buren's sub-treasury and other economic proposals passed, but as hard times continued, the Whigs saw an increased vote in the 1837 elections, and captured the New York Assembly. This set up a fight for the 1838 gubernatorial nomination. Fillmore supported the leading Whig vice presidential candidate from 1836, <a href="Francis%20Granger">Francis Granger</a>; Weed preferred Seward. Fillmore was embittered when Weed got the nomination for Seward, but campaigned loyally; Seward was elected, while Fillmore won another term in the House.

The rivalry between Fillmore and Seward was affected by the growing anti-slavery movement. Although Fillmore disliked slavery, he saw no reason it should be a political issue. Seward, on the other hand, was hostile to slavery and made that clear in his actions as governor, refusing to return slaves claimed by Southerners. When the Buffalo bar in 1839 proposed Fillmore for the position of vice chancellor of the eighth judicial district, Seward refused, and nominated <a href="Frederick%20Whittlesey">Frederick Whittlesey</a>—indicating that if <a href="New%20York%20Senate">the state senate</a> rejected Whittlesey, he still would not appoint Fillmore.

Fillmore was active in the discussions of presidential candidates that preceded the <a href="1839%20Whig%20National%20Convention">Whig National Convention</a> for the 1840 race. He initially supported General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, but really wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> for president, with former Virginia senator <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201840">the Harrison campaign</a>, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.

At the urging of Senator Clay, Harrison quickly called a special session of Congress. With the Whigs to organize the House for the first time, Fillmore sought the Speakership, but it went to a Clay acolyte, <a href="John%20White%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">John White</a> of Kentucky. Nevertheless, Fillmore was made chairman of the <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">House Ways and Means Committee</a>. Harrison was expected to go along with anything Clay and other congressional Whig leaders proposed, but died on April 4, 1841, elevating Vice President Tyler to the presidency. Tyler, a onetime maverick Democrat, soon broke with Clay over congressional proposals for a national bank to stabilize the currency, which he vetoed twice, leading to his expulsion from the Whig Party. Fillmore remained on the fringes of that conflict, generally supporting the congressional Whig position, but his chief achievement as Ways and Means chairman was the <a href="Tariff%20of%201842">Tariff of 1842</a>. The existing tariff did not protect manufacturing, and part of the revenue was distributed to the states, a decision made in better times that was by then depleting the Treasury. Fillmore prepared a bill raising tariff rates that was popular in the country, but the continuation of distribution assured a Tyler veto, and much political advantage for the Whigs. Once Tyler vetoed it, a House committee headed by Massachusetts' <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> condemned his actions. Fillmore prepared a second bill, this time omitting distribution, and when it reached his desk, Tyler signed it, but in the process offended his erstwhile Democratic allies. Thus, Fillmore not only achieved his legislative goal, but managed to politically isolate Tyler.

Fillmore received praise for the tariff, but in July 1842 he announced he would not seek re-election. The Whigs nominated him anyway, but he refused it. Tired of Washington life and the conflict that had revolved around President Tyler, Fillmore sought to return to his life and law practice in Buffalo. Fillmore continued to be active in the <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a> of Congress that followed the 1842 elections and returned to Buffalo in April 1843. According to his biographer, Scarry: "Fillmore concluded his Congressional career at a point when he had become a powerful figure, an able statesman at the height of his popularity". Thurlow Weed deemed Congressman Fillmore "able in debate, wise in council, and inflexible in his political sentiments".

Out of office, Fillmore continued his law practice and made long-neglected repairs to his Buffalo home. He remained a major political figure, leading the committee of notables that welcomed John Quincy Adams to Buffalo, and the former president expressed his regret at Fillmore's absence from the halls of Congress. Some urged Fillmore to run for vice president with Clay, the consensus Whig choice for president in 1844—<a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> wrote privately that "my own first choice has long been Millard Fillmore"—others thought Fillmore should try to win back the governor's mansion for the Whigs. Seeking to return to Washington, Fillmore wanted the vice presidency.

Fillmore hoped to gain the endorsement of the New York delegation to the national convention, but Weed wanted the vice presidency for Seward, with Fillmore as governor. Seward, however, withdrew prior to the <a href="1844%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1844 Whig National Convention</a>. When Weed's replacement vice presidential hopeful, <a href="Willis%20Hall%20%28New%20York%29">Willis Hall</a>, fell ill, Weed sought to defeat Fillmore's candidacy to force him to run for governor. Weed's attempts to boost Fillmore as a gubernatorial candidate caused the former congressman to write, "I am not willing to be treacherously killed by this pretended kindness ... do not suppose for a minute that I think they desire my nomination for governor." New York sent a delegation to the convention in Baltimore pledged to support Clay, but with no instructions as to how to vote for vice president. Weed told out-of-state delegates that the New York party preferred to have Fillmore as its gubernatorial candidate, and after Clay was nominated for president, the second place on the ticket fell to former New Jersey senator <a href="Theodore%20Frelinghuysen">Theodore Frelinghuysen</a>.

Putting a good face on his defeat, Fillmore met and publicly appeared with Frelinghuysen, quietly spurning Weed's offer to get him nominated as governor at the state convention. Fillmore's position in opposing slavery, but only at the state level, made him acceptable as a statewide Whig candidate, and Weed saw to it the pressure on Fillmore increased. Fillmore had previously stated that a convention had the right to draft anyone for political service, and Weed got the convention to choose Fillmore, who had broad support despite his reluctance.

The Democrats nominated Senator <a href="Silas%20Wright">Silas Wright</a> as their gubernatorial candidate, and former Tennessee governor <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> for president. Although Fillmore worked to gain support among <a href="German-Americans">German-Americans</a>, a major constituency, he was hurt among immigrants by the fact that New York City Whigs had supported a nativist candidate in the mayoral election earlier in 1844—Fillmore and his party were tarred with that brush. He was not friendly to immigrants, and blamed his defeat on "foreign Catholics". Clay was beaten as well. Fillmore's biographer Paul Finkelman suggested that the hostility to immigrants and weak position on slavery defeated him for governor.

In 1846, Fillmore was involved in the founding of the <a href="University%20of%20Buffalo">University of Buffalo</a>, and became its first chancellor; he served until his death in 1874. He had opposed the <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annexation of Texas</a>, and spoke against the subsequent <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, seeing it as a contrivance to extend slavery's realm. Fillmore was angered when President Polk vetoed a river and harbors bill that would have benefitted Buffalo, and wrote, "May God save the country for it is evident the people will not." New York governors at the time served a two-year term, and Fillmore could have had the Whig nomination in 1846, had he wanted it. He actually came within one vote of it while maneuvering to get the nomination for his supporter, <a href="John%20Young%20%28governor%29">John Young</a>, who was elected. A new constitution for New York state provided that the office of <a href="Comptroller%20of%20New%20York">comptroller</a> was made elective, as were the <a href="New%20York%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a> and some other positions that were formerly chosen by the state legislature. Fillmore's work in finance while Ways and Means chairman made him an obvious candidate for comptroller, and he was successful in getting the Whig nomination for the 1847 election. With a united party at his back, Fillmore won by 38,000 votes, the largest margin a Whig candidate for statewide office would ever have in New York.

Before moving to Albany to take office on January 1, 1848, he left his law firm and rented out his house. Fillmore received positive reviews for his service as comptroller. In that office, he was a member of the state canal board, supported its expansion, and saw that it was managed competently. He secured an enlargement of Buffalo's canal facilities. The comptroller regulated the banks, and Fillmore stabilized the currency by requiring that state-chartered banks keep New York and federal bonds to the value of the banknotes they issued—<a href="National%20Bank%20Act">a similar plan</a> was adopted by Congress in 1864.

President Polk had pledged not to seek a second term, and with gains in Congress during the 1846 election cycle, the Whigs were hopeful of taking the White House in 1848. The party's perennial candidates, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, each wanted the nomination, and amassed support from congressional colleagues. Many rank and file Whigs backed the Mexican War hero, General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, for president. Although Taylor was extremely popular, many northerners had qualms about electing a Louisiana slaveholder at a time of sectional tension over whether slavery should be allowed in the territories ceded by Mexico. Taylor's uncertain political views gave others pause—career Army, he had never cast a ballot for president, though he stated that he was a Whig supporter, and some feared they might elect another Tyler, or another Harrison.

With the nomination undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York to send an uncommitted delegation to the <a href="1848%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1848 Whig National Convention</a> in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, though he did not tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward and did not want to see him gain high office.

Despite Weed's efforts, Taylor was nominated on the fourth ballot, to the anger of Clay's supporters and of <a href="Conscience%20Whigs">Conscience Whigs</a> from the Northeast. When order was restored, <a href="John%20A.%20Collier">John A. Collier</a>, a New Yorker and a Weed opponent, addressed the convention. Delegates hung on his every word as he described himself as a Clay partisan; he had voted for Clay on each ballot. He eloquently described the grief of the Clay supporters, frustrated again in their battle to make Clay president. Collier warned of a fatal breach in the party, and stated that only one thing could prevent it: the nomination of Fillmore for vice president, whom he incorrectly depicted as a strong Clay supporter. Fillmore in fact agreed with many of Clay's positions, but did not back him for president and was not in Philadelphia. Delegates did not know this was false, or at least greatly exaggerated, and there was a large reaction in Fillmore's favor. At the time, the presidential candidate did not automatically pick his running mate, and despite the efforts of Taylor's managers to get the nomination for their choice, <a href="Abbott%20Lawrence">Abbott Lawrence</a> of Massachusetts, Fillmore became the Whig nominee for vice president on the second ballot.

Weed had wanted the vice presidential nomination for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them in more ways than one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him for his role in the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's <a href="Thomas%20Ewing">Thomas Ewing</a>. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.

It was customary in mid-19th century America for a candidate for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> for president, with General <a href="William%20O.%20Butler">William O. Butler</a> his running mate, but it became a three-way fight, as the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.

Northerners assumed that Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was an opponent of the spread of slavery. Southerners accused him of being an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published letter that slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.

In the end, the Taylor/Fillmore ticket won narrowly, with New York's electoral votes again key to the election. The Whig ticket won the popular vote by 1,361,393 (47.3 percent) to 1,223,460 (42.5 percent), and triumphed 163 to 127 in the Electoral College. Minor party candidates took no electoral votes, but the strength of the burgeoning anti-slavery movement was shown by the vote for Van Buren—though he won no states, he earned 291,501 votes (10.1 percent), and finished second in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.

Millard Fillmore was sworn in as vice president on March 5, 1849, in the <a href="Old%20Senate%20Chamber">Senate Chamber</a>. March 4 (then <a href="Inauguration%20Day">Inauguration Day</a>) fell on a Sunday, so the swearing-in was postponed until the following day. Fillmore took the oath from <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a> and in turn swore in the senators beginning their terms, including Seward, who in February had <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201849">been elected by the New York legislature</a>.

Fillmore had spent the four months between the election and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and winding up affairs in the comptroller's office. Taylor had written to him, promising influence in the new administration; the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">president-elect</a> mistakenly thought that the vice president was a cabinet member, which was not true in the 19th century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general agreement on how to divide federal jobs in New York. Seward, once he went to Washington, made friendly contact with Taylor's cabinet nominees, advisers, and the general's brother, and an alliance between the incoming administration and the Weed machine was soon under way behind Fillmore's back. In exchange for support, Seward and Weed were allowed to designate who was to fill federal jobs in New York, with Fillmore given far less than had been agreed. When Fillmore, after the inauguration, discovered this, he went to Taylor, which only made the warfare against Fillmore's influence more conspicuous. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had nominated him at the convention, were passed over for candidates backed by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This greatly increased the influence of Weed in New York politics, and diminished Fillmore's. According to Rayback, "by mid-1849, Fillmore's situation had become desperate." Despite his lack of influence, he was pestered by office seekers and those with a house to lease or sell him, as there was then no official residence for the vice president. He enjoyed one aspect of his office, due to his lifelong love of learning: he became deeply involved in the administration of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> as a member "<a href="ex%20officio">ex officio</a>" of its Board of Regents.

Through 1849, the slavery issue was unresolved in the territories. Taylor advocated the admission of California and of New Mexico, as likely to outlaw slavery. Southerners were surprised to learn the president, despite being a Southern slaveholder, did not support the introduction of slavery into the new territories, as he believed the institution could not flourish in the arid Southwest. There was anger across party lines in the South, where making the territories free of slavery was considered excluding Southerners from part of the national heritage. When Congress met in December 1849, this discord was manifested in the election for Speaker, which took weeks and dozens of ballots to resolve as the House divided along sectional lines.

Fillmore countered the Weed machine by building a network of like-minded Whigs in New York state; with backing from wealthy New Yorkers, their positions were publicized by the establishment of a rival newspaper to Weed's "Albany Evening Journal". All pretense at friendship between Fillmore and Weed vanished in November 1849 when the two happened to meet in New York City, and they exchanged accusations.

Fillmore presided over some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the territories. The ongoing sectional conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the boundary dispute whereby the state of Texas claimed much of what is now the state of New Mexico. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced what was called the "<a href="Omnibus%20bill">Omnibus Bill</a>". The bill would give victories to both North and South: it would admit California as a free state, organize territorial governments in New Mexico and <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah</a>, and ban the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale and export out of it. It would also toughen the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20%281793%29">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, as resistance to enforcement in parts of the North was a longtime Southern grievance. Clay's bill provided for the settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute; the status of slavery in the territories would be decided by those living there (known as <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a>). Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, and it languished in Congress, but Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, in May 1850 informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor. He did his best to keep the peace among the senators, reminding them of the vice president's power to rule them out of order, but was blamed for failing to maintain it when a physical confrontation between Mississippi's <a href="Henry%20S.%20Foote">Henry S. Foote</a> and Missouri's <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a> broke out on April 17—before other senators intervened to separate them, Foote pointed a gun at his colleague as Benton advanced on him.

July 4, 1850 was a very hot day in Washington, and President Taylor, who attended <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">Fourth of July</a> ceremonies, refreshed himself, likely with cold milk and cherries. What he consumed probably gave him <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>, and he died on July 9. Taylor, nicknamed "Old Rough and Ready", had gained a reputation for toughness through his military campaigning in the heat, and his sudden death came as a shock to the nation.

Fillmore had been called from his chair presiding over the Senate on July 8, and had sat with members of the cabinet in a vigil outside Taylor's bedroom at the White House. He received the formal notification of the president's death, signed by the cabinet, on the evening of July 9 in his residence at the <a href="Willard%20Hotel">Willard Hotel</a>. After acknowledging the letter, and spending a sleepless night, Fillmore went to the House of Representatives, where, at a <a href="Joint%20session%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">joint session of Congress</a>, he took the oath as president from <a href="William%20Cranch">William Cranch</a>, chief judge of <a href="United%20States%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">the federal court for the District of Columbia</a>, and the man who had sworn in President Tyler. The cabinet officers, as was customary when a new president took over, submitted their resignations, expecting Fillmore to refuse, allowing them to continue in office. Fillmore had been marginalized by the cabinet members, and the new president accepted the resignations, though he asked them to stay on for a month, which most refused to do. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet. He was already in discussions with Whig leaders, and on July 20 began to send new nominations to the Senate, with the Fillmore cabinet to be led by Webster as Secretary of State. Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting Clay's bill, and with his Senate term to expire in 1851, had no electoral future in his home state. Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Postmaster General</a>, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments. The new department heads were mostly supporters of the Compromise, as was Fillmore.

The brief pause from politics out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis. Texas had attempted to assert its authority in New Mexico territory, and the state's governor, <a href="Peter%20H.%20Bell">Peter H. Bell</a>, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor. Fillmore received another such after becoming president. He reinforced federal troops in the area, and warned Bell to keep the peace. By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the "Mormons" were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus. Illinois Senator <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> then stepped to the fore, with Clay's agreement, proposing to break the Omnibus into individual bills that could be passed piecemeal. Fillmore endorsed this strategy, with the Omnibus to become (as it proved) five bills.

Fillmore sent a special message to Congress on August 6, 1850, disclosing the letter from Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the presence of the <a href="Great%20Triumvirate">Great Triumvirate</a> of <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, Webster, and Clay, who had long dominated the Senate; Douglas and others were able to lead that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate with the support of the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Bill</a>, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman <a href="Abraham%20Schermerhorn">Abraham Schermerhorn</a> of <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a>, whose constituents included <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between <a href="New%20Mexico%20Territory">New Mexico Territory</a> and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.

The Fugitive Slave Act was also the root of contention after its enactment: Southerners complained bitterly about any leniency in its application, but its enforcement was highly offensive to many Northerners. Abolitionists recited the inequities of the law: it punished severely anyone aiding an escaped slave, and it granted no due process to the escapee, who could not testify before a magistrate. The law also permitted higher payment to the hearing magistrate for deciding the escapee was a slave rather than free. Nevertheless, Fillmore believed himself bound by his oath as president and by the bargain made in the Compromise to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. He did so even though some prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, with acquittals or <a href="Shadrach%20Minkins">the slave taken from federal custody and freed by a Boston mob</a>. Such cases were widely publicized North and South, and inflamed passions in both places, undermining the good feeling that had followed the Compromise.

In August 1850, the social reformer <a href="Dorothea%20Dix">Dorothea Dix</a> wrote to Fillmore, urging support of her proposal in Congress for land grants to finance asylums for the impoverished mentally ill. Though her proposal did not pass, they became friends, meeting in person and corresponding, continuing well after Fillmore's presidency. In September of that year, Fillmore appointed <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> leader <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a> as the first governor of <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah Territory</a>. In gratitude, Young named the first territorial capital "<a href="Fillmore%2C%20Utah">Fillmore</a>" and the surrounding county "<a href="Millard%20County%2C%20Utah">Millard</a>".

A longtime supporter of national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills to subsidize the <a href="Illinois%20Central">Illinois Central</a> railroad from Chicago to <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, and for <a href="Soo%20Locks">a canal</a> at <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. The 1851 completion of the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a> in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along the way from the train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.

Fillmore appointed one justice to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, and made four appointments to <a href="United%20States%20District%20Courts">United States District Courts</a>, including that of his law partner and cabinet officer, Nathan Hall, to the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20New%20York">federal district court in Buffalo</a>. When Supreme Court Justice <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a> died in September 1851 with the Senate not in session, Fillmore made a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> of <a href="Benjamin%20Robbins%20Curtis">Benjamin Robbins Curtis</a> to the high court. In December, with Congress convened, Fillmore made formal nomination of Curtis, who was confirmed. In 1857, Justice Curtis dissented to the Court’s decision in the slavery case of "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>", and resigned as a matter of principle.

Justice <a href="John%20McKinley">John McKinley</a>'s death in 1852 led to repeated, fruitless attempts by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> attorney <a href="Edward%20A.%20Bradford">Edward A. Bradford</a>. Fillmore's second choice, <a href="George%20Edmund%20Badger">George Edmund Badger</a>, asked that his name be withdrawn. Senator-elect <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a> declined to serve. The nomination of <a href="William%20C.%20Micou">William C. Micou</a>, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> nominated <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, who was confirmed by the Senate.

Fillmore oversaw two highly competent Secretaries of State, <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, and after the New Englander's 1852 death, <a href="Edward%20Everett">Edward Everett</a>, looking over their shoulders and making all major decisions. The president was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which at this time still <a href="Sakoku">prohibited nearly all foreign contact</a>. American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan "opened up" for trade. This would allow not only commerce, but permit American ships to call there for food and water, and in emergencies without being punished. They were concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals. Fillmore and Webster dispatched <a href="Commodore%20%28USN%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Matthew%20Perry%20%28naval%20officer%29">Matthew C. Perry</a> on <a href="Perry%20Expedition">an expedition</a> to open Japan to relations with the outside world. Perry and his ships reached Japan in July 1853, four months after the end of Fillmore's term.

Fillmore was a staunch opponent of European influence in Hawaii. France under <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> sought to annex Hawaii, but backed down after Fillmore issued a strongly worded message warning that "the United States would not stand for any such action." Taylor had pressed Portugal for payment of American claims dating as far back as the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and had refused offers of arbitration; Fillmore gained a favorable settlement.

Fillmore had difficulties regarding <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Cuba">Cuba</a>; many Southerners hoped to see the island part of the U.S. as slave territory: Cuba was a colony of Spain where slavery was practiced. Venezuelan adventurer <a href="Narciso%20L%C3%B3pez">Narciso López</a> recruited Americans for three <a href="filibuster%20%28military%29">filibustering</a> expeditions to Cuba, in the hope of overthrowing Spanish rule there. After the second attempt in 1850, López and some of his followers were indicted for breach of the <a href="Neutrality%20Act%20of%201794">Neutrality Act</a>, but were quickly acquitted by friendly Southern juries. The final López expedition ended with his execution by the Spanish, who put several Americans before the firing squad, including the nephew of Attorney General Crittenden. This resulted in riots against the Spanish in New Orleans, causing their consul to flee; historian Elbert E. Smith, who wrote of the Taylor and Fillmore presidencies, suggested that Fillmore could have had war against Spain had he wanted it. Instead, Fillmore, Webster and the Spanish worked out a series of face-saving measures that settled the crisis without armed conflict. Many Southerners, including Whigs, supported the filibusters, and Fillmore's response helped divide his party as the 1852 election approached.

A much-publicized event of Fillmore's presidency was the arrival in late 1851 of <a href="Lajos%20Kossuth">Lajos Kossuth</a>, the exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution against Austria. Kossuth wanted the U.S. to recognize Hungary's independence. Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were now coming to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. Kossuth was feted by Congress, and Fillmore allowed a White House meeting after receiving word that Kossuth would not try to politicize it. In spite of his promise, Kossuth made a speech promoting his cause. The American enthusiasm for Kossuth petered out, and he departed for Europe; Fillmore refused to change American policy, remaining neutral.

As the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">election of 1852</a> approached, Fillmore remained undecided whether to run for a full term as president. Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though past seventy, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. Fillmore, sympathetic to the ambitions of his longtime friend, issued a letter in late 1851 stating that he did not seek a full term, but he was reluctant to rule it out, fearing the party would be captured by the Sewardites. Thus, approaching the <a href="1852%20Whig%20National%20Convention">national convention</a> in Baltimore, to be held in June 1852, the major candidates were Fillmore, Webster and General Scott. Weed and Seward backed Scott; in late May, the Democrats nominated former New Hampshire senator <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, who had been out of national politics for nearly a decade before 1852, but whose profile had risen as a result of his military service in the Mexican War. The nomination of Pierce, a northerner sympathetic to the southern view on slavery, united the Democrats and meant the Whig candidate would face an uphill battle to gain the presidency.

Fillmore was by then unpopular with northern Whigs for signing and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act, but had considerable support from the South, where he was seen as the only candidate capable of uniting the party. Once the convention passed a <a href="party%20platform">party platform</a> endorsing the Compromise as a final settlement of the slavery question, Fillmore was willing to withdraw, but found that many of his supporters could not accept Webster and his action would nominate Scott. The convention deadlocked, and this persisted through Saturday, June 19, when a total of 46 ballots had been taken; delegates adjourned until Monday. Party leaders proposed a deal to both Fillmore and Webster: if the secretary could increase his vote total over the next several ballots, enough Fillmore supporters would go along to put him over the top; if he could not, Webster would withdraw in favor of Fillmore. The president quickly agreed, but Webster did not do so until Monday morning. On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot. Webster was far more unhappy at the outcome than was Fillmore, who refused the secretary's resignation. Bereft of the votes of much of the South, and also of Northerners who depended on peaceful intersectional trade, Scott was easily beaten by Pierce in November. Smith suggested that the Whigs might have done much better with Fillmore.

The final months of Fillmore's term were uneventful. Webster died in October 1852, but during the final illness, Fillmore effectively acted as his own Secretary of State without incident, and Everett stepped competently into Webster's shoes. Fillmore intended to lecture Congress on the slavery question in his final <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message</a> in December, but was talked out of it by his cabinet, and he contented himself with pointing out the prosperity of the nation and expressing gratitude for the opportunity to serve it. There was little discussion of slavery during the <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a> of Congress, and Fillmore left office on March 4, 1853, succeeded by Pierce.

Fillmore was the first president to return to private life without independent wealth or possession of a landed estate. With no pension to anticipate, he needed to earn a living, and felt it should be in a way that would uphold the dignity of his former office. His friend, Judge Hall, assured him it would be proper for him to practice law in the higher courts of New York, and Fillmore so intended. The Fillmores had planned a tour of the South after leaving the White House, but Abigail caught a cold at President Pierce's inauguration, developed pneumonia, and died in Washington on March 30, 1853. A saddened Fillmore returned to Buffalo for the burial. The fact that he was in mourning limited his social activities, and he made ends meet on the income from his investments. He was bereaved again on July 26, 1854 when his only daughter Mary died of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>.

The former president ended his seclusion in early 1854, as debate over Senator Douglas's <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Bill</a> embroiled the nation. This would open the northern portion of the Louisiana Purchase to settlement, including slavery, and would end the northern limit on slavery under the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> of 1820. Fillmore retained many supporters, and planned an ostensibly nonpolitical national tour, while privately rallying disaffected Whig politicians to preserve the Union, and back him in a run for president. Fillmore made public appearances opening railroads and visiting the grave of Senator Clay, but met with politicians out of the public eye, during the late winter and spring of 1854.

Such a comeback could not be under the auspices of the Whig Party, with its remnants divided by the Kansas–Nebraska legislation (which passed with the support of Pierce). Many northern foes of slavery, such as Seward, gravitated towards a new party, the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, but Fillmore saw no home for himself there. There was in the early 1850s considerable hostility towards immigrants, especially Catholics, who had recently arrived in the United States in large numbers; several <a href="nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> organizations, including the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Star%20Spangled%20Banner">Order of the Star Spangled Banner</a>, sprang up in reaction. By 1854, the Order had morphed into the American Party, which became known as the <a href="Know%20Nothings">Know Nothings</a>—in its early days, members were sworn to keep its internal deliberations private, and if asked, were to say they knew nothing about them. Many from Fillmore's "National Whig" faction had joined the Know Nothings by 1854, and influenced the organization to take up causes besides nativism. Fillmore was encouraged by the success of the Know Nothings in the 1854 midterm elections, in which they won in several Northeastern states and showed strength in the South. On January 1, 1855, he sent a letter for publication, warning against immigrant influence in American elections, and soon thereafter joined the Order of the Star Spangled Banner.

Later that year, Fillmore went abroad, stating publicly that as he lacked office, he might as well travel. The trip was at the advice of political friends, who felt that by touring, he would avoid involvement in the contentious issues of the day, and he spent over a year, from March 1855 to June 1856, in Europe and the Middle East. <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> is said to have pronounced the ex-president the handsomest man she had ever seen, and his coincidental appearance with Van Buren in the gallery of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> triggered a comment from MP <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>. Fillmore was offered an <a href="Honorary%20doctorate">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Civil%20Law">Doctor of Civil Law</a> (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford; he declined, explaining that he had neither the "literary nor scientific attainment" to justify the degree. He is also quoted, that he "lacked the benefit of a classical education" and could not, therefore, understand the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> text of the diploma, adding that he believed "no man should accept a degree he cannot read." Alternatively, Fillmore may have refused the degree to escape the heckling and taunting which Oxford students typically imposed upon the recipients of such honors.

Dorothea Dix had preceded him to Europe, and was lobbying to improve conditions for the mentally ill. They continued to correspond, and met several times. In Rome, Fillmore had <a href="Audience%20%28meeting%29%23Papal%20audiences">an audience</a> with <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a>. He carefully weighed the political pros and cons of meeting with Pius; he nearly withdrew from the meeting when told he would have to kneel and kiss the pope's hand. To avoid this, Pius remained seated throughout the meeting.

Fillmore's allies were in full control of the American Party, and they arranged for him to get its presidential nomination while he was in Europe. The <a href="1856%20American%20National%20Convention">Know Nothing convention</a> chose <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a> of Kentucky to be Fillmore's running mate; he was the nephew by marriage and onetime ward of President Jackson. Fillmore made a celebrated return in June 1856, speaking at a series of welcomes, which began with his arrival at a huge reception in New York City, and continued across the state to Buffalo. These addresses were portrayed as expressions of thanks for his reception, rather than as campaign speeches, which might be considered illicit office-seeking if made by a presidential hopeful. Fillmore warned that electing the Republican candidate, former California senator <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>, who had no support in the South, would divide the Union and lead to civil war. Both Fillmore and the Democratic candidate, former Pennsylvania senator <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, agreed that slavery was principally a matter for state and not federal government. Fillmore rarely spoke about the immigration question, and focused on the sectional divide, urging preservation of the Union.

Once Fillmore was back home in Buffalo, he had no excuse to make speeches, and his campaign stagnated through the summer and fall of 1856. Political fixers who had been Whigs, such as Weed, tended to join the Republican Party, and the Know Nothings lacked experience at selling anything but nativism. Accordingly, Fillmore's pro-Union stance mostly went unheard. Although the South was friendly towards Fillmore, many there feared a Frémont victory would lead to secession, and some sympathetic to Fillmore moved into the Buchanan camp lest the anti-Frémont vote be split, which might elect the Republican. Scarry suggested that the events of 1856, including <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">the conflict</a> in <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a> and the <a href="caning%20of%20Charles%20Sumner">caning of Charles Sumner</a> on the floor of the Senate, polarized the nation, making Fillmore's moderate stance obsolete.

On Election Day, Buchanan won with 1,836,072 votes (45.3%) and 174 electoral votes to Frémont's 1,342,345 votes (33.1%) and 114 electoral votes. Fillmore and Donelson finished third, winning 873,053 votes (21.6%) and carrying the state of Maryland and its 8 electoral votes. The American Party ticket narrowly lost in several southern states, and a change of fewer than 8,000 votes in Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee would have thrown the election to the House of Representatives, where the sectional divide would have made the outcome uncertain.

Historian <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> wrote that Fillmore was not a Know Nothing or a nativist. He was out of the country when the nomination came and had not been consulted about running. Furthermore, "By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American tenets." He sought national unity and felt the American Party was the "only hope of forming a truly national party, which shall ignore this constant and distracting agitation of slavery."

Fillmore considered his political career to be at an end with his defeat in 1856. He again felt inhibited from returning to the practice of law. But his financial worries were removed when on February 10, 1858, he married <a href="Caroline%20Fillmore">Caroline McIntosh</a>, a well-to-do widow. Their combined wealth allowed them to purchase a large house on <a href="Niagara%20Square">Niagara Square</a> in Buffalo, where they lived for the remainder of his life. There, the Fillmores devoted themselves to entertaining and philanthropy; according to historian Smith, "they generously supported almost every conceivable cause". Among these was the <a href="Buffalo%20and%20Erie%20County%20Historical%20Society">Buffalo Historical Society</a> and the <a href="Buffalo%20General%20Hospital">Buffalo General Hospital</a>, which he helped found.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">election of 1860</a>, Fillmore voted for Senator Douglas, the nominee of the northern Democrats. After the vote, in which the Republican candidate, former Illinois representative <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was elected, many sought out Fillmore's views but he refused to take any part in the secession crisis that followed, feeling that he lacked influence. He decried Buchanan's inaction as states left the Union, writing that while the federal government could not coerce a state, those advocating secession should simply be regarded as traitors. When Lincoln came to Buffalo en route to his inauguration, Fillmore led the committee selected to receive the president-elect, hosted him at his mansion, and took him to church. Once war came, Fillmore supported Lincoln in his efforts to preserve the Union. He commanded the Union Continentals, a corps of <a href="militia">home guards</a> of males over the age of 45 from the upstate New York area. The Continentals trained to defend the Buffalo area in the event of a Confederate attack. They performed military drill and ceremonial functions at parades, funerals, and other events. The Union Continentals guarded Lincoln's funeral train in Buffalo. They continued operations after the war, and Fillmore remained active with them almost until his death.

Despite Fillmore's zeal in the war effort, he gave a speech in early 1864 calling for magnanimity towards the South at war's end, and counting the heavy cost, financial and in blood, of the war. The Lincoln administration saw this as an attack on it that could not be tolerated in an election year, and Fillmore was criticized in many newspapers, called a <a href="Copperhead%20%28politics%29">Copperhead</a> and even a traitor. This led to lasting ill-feeling against Fillmore in many circles. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 presidential election</a> Fillmore supported Democratic candidate <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> for the presidency, believing that the Democratic Party's plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the Union.

After <a href="Lincoln%27s%20assassination">Lincoln's assassination</a> in April 1865, black ink was thrown on Fillmore's house because it was not draped in mourning like others; he was apparently out of town at the time and put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger towards him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. He devoted most of his time to civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city to have a permanent art gallery, with the <a href="Buffalo%20Fine%20Arts%20Academy">Buffalo Fine Arts Academy</a>.
Fillmore stayed in good health almost to the end, but suffered a stroke in February 1874, and died after a second one on March 8. Two days later, he was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo after a funeral procession including hundreds of notables; the U.S. Senate sent three of its members to honor its former president, including Lincoln's first vice president, Maine's <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a>.

According to biographer Scarry: "No president of the United States ... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore". He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents who served in the years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, later president <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> "characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial <a href="Thumb%20twiddling">thumb-twaddler</a> who would do nothing to offend anyone", and as responsible in part for the war. Anna Prior, writing in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" in 2010, stated that Fillmore's very name connotes mediocrity. Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, "on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse ... in the end, Fillmore was always on the wrong side of the great moral and political issues". Rayback, however, applauded "the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union".
Although Fillmore has become something of a cult figure as America's most forgettable chief executive, Smith found him to be "a conscientious president" who chose to honor his oath of office and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, rather than govern based on his personal preferences. Paul G. Calabresi and <a href="Christopher%20S.%20Yoo">Christopher S. Yoo</a>, in their study of presidential power, deemed Fillmore "a faithful executor of the laws of the United States—for good and for ill". But, according to Smith, the enforcement of the act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation. Fillmore's place in history has also suffered because "even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856". Smith argued that Fillmore's association with the Know Nothings looks far worse in retrospect than it did at the time, and that the former president was not motivated by <a href="Nativism_%28politics%29%23United_States">nativism</a> in his candidacy.

Benson Lee Grayson suggested that the Fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked. Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> and laid the groundwork for the <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Treaty</a> during Pierce's presidency. Meanwhile, the Fillmore administration resolved a controversy with Portugal left over from the Taylor administration, smoothed over a disagreement with Peru over <a href="List%20of%20Guano%20Island%20claims">guano island</a>s, and peacefully resolved disputes with Britain, France, and Spain over Cuba. All of these crises were resolved without the United States going to war or losing face. Grayson also applauded Fillmore's firm stand against Texas' ambitions in New Mexico during the 1850 crisis. Fred I. Greenstein and Dale Anderson praised Fillmore for his resoluteness in his early months in office, noting that Fillmore "is typically described as stolid, bland, and conventional, but such terms underestimate the forcefulness evinced by his handling of the Texas–New Mexico border crisis, his decision to replace Taylor's entire cabinet, and his effectiveness in advancing the Compromise of 1850".

Millard Fillmore, with his wife Abigail, established the first White House library. There are a number of remembrances of Millard Fillmore; his East Aurora house still stands, and sites honor him at his birthplace and boyhood home (where a replica log cabin was dedicated in 1963 by the Millard Fillmore Memorial Association.) A statue of Fillmore stands outside Buffalo City Hall. At the university he helped found, now <a href="SUNY%20Buffalo">SUNY Buffalo</a>, Millard Fillmore Academic Center and Millard Fillmore College bear his name. On February 18, 2010, the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> released the thirteenth coin in the <a href="Presidential%20%241%20Coin%20Program">Presidential $1 Coin Program</a>, bearing Fillmore's likeness.

According to the assessment of Fillmore by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia:

John Tyler

John Tyler (March 29, 1790 – January 18, 1862) was the tenth <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from 1841 to 1845 after briefly being the tenth <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> (1841); he was <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201840">elected to the latter office</a> on the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840</a> <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> ticket with President <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. Tyler ascended to the presidency after Harrison's death in April 1841, only a month after the start of the new administration. He was a stalwart supporter of <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a>, and as president he adopted nationalist policies only when they did not infringe on the powers of the states. His unexpected rise to the presidency, with the resulting threat to the presidential ambitions of <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> and other politicians, left him estranged from both major political parties.

Tyler, born to <a href="Tyler%20family">a prominent Virginia family</a>, became a national figure at a time of political upheaval. In the 1820s the nation's only political party, the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republicans</a>, split into factions. He was initially a <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrat</a>, but opposed <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> during the <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">Nullification Crisis</a>, seeing Jackson's actions as infringing upon states' rights, and criticized Jackson's expansion of executive power during the <a href="Bank%20War">Bank War</a>. This led Tyler to ally with the Whig Party. Tyler served as a Virginia <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">state legislator</a>, <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">governor</a>, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. representative</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. senator</a>. He was <a href="ticket%20balance">put on the 1840 presidential ticket</a> to attract states' rights Southerners to a Whig coalition to defeat <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>'s re-election bid.

With the death of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice president to <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20line%20of%20succession">succeed to the presidency</a> without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the <a href="Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">oath of office</a>, moved into the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment</a>. While Tyler did sign into law some of the Whig-controlled Congress's bills, as a <a href="strict%20constructionist">strict constructionist</a> he <a href="veto">veto</a>ed the party's bills to create a national bank and raise the tariff rates. Believing that the president should set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">Cabinet</a> resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him "His Accidency", expelled him from the party. Tyler was the first president to see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the <a href="Webster%E2%80%93Ashburton%20Treaty">Webster–Ashburton Treaty</a> with <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wanghia">Treaty of Wanghia</a> with <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing China</a>.

The <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> separated from Mexico in 1836; Tyler, a firm believer in <a href="manifest%20destiny">manifest destiny</a>, saw its annexation as providing an economic advantage to the United States, and worked diligently to make it happen. He initially sought election to a full term as president, but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats, he withdrew in support of Democrat James K. Polk, who favored annexation. Polk won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">election</a>, and Tyler signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. Under Polk, the process was completed. After the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began in 1861, Tyler joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>; he won election to the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate House of Representatives</a> shortly before his death. Although some have praised Tyler's political resolve, his presidency is generally held in <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">low regard by historians</a>. He is considered an obscure president, with little presence in American cultural memory.

John Tyler was born on March 29, 1790; like his future <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a>, William Henry Harrison, Tyler hailed from <a href="Charles%20City%20County%2C%20Virginia">Charles City County, Virginia</a> and was descended from aristocratic and <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20political%20families">politically entrenched families</a> of English ancestry. The <a href="Tyler%20family">Tyler family</a> traced its lineage to colonial <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a> in the 17th century. <a href="John%20Tyler%20Sr.">John Tyler Sr.</a>, commonly known as Judge Tyler, was a friend and college roommate of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and served in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> alongside <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison%20V">Benjamin Harrison V</a>, father of William. The elder Tyler served four years as Speaker of the House of Delegates before becoming a <a href="state%20court%20%28United%20States%29">state court</a> judge. He subsequently served as <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">governor</a> and as a judge on the U.S. District Court at <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. His wife, Mary Marot (Armistead), was the daughter of a prominent plantation owner, Robert Booth Armistead. She died of a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> when her son John was seven years old.

With two brothers and five sisters, Tyler was reared on <a href="Greenway%20Plantation">Greenway Plantation</a>, a estate with a six-room manor house his father had built. The Tylers' forty <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20Virginia">slaves</a> grew various crops, including wheat, corn and tobacco. Judge Tyler paid high wages for tutors who challenged his children academically. Tyler was of frail health, thin and prone to diarrhea throughout life. At the age of twelve, he entered the preparatory branch of the elite <a href="College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a>, continuing the Tyler family's tradition of attending the college. Tyler graduated from the school's collegiate branch in 1807, at age seventeen. Among the books that formed his economic views was <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a>", and he acquired a lifelong love of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. His political opinions were shaped by Bishop <a href="James%20Madison%20%28bishop%29">James Madison</a>, the college's president and namesake of <a href="James%20Madison">the future president</a>; the bishop served as a second father and mentor to Tyler.

After graduation Tyler <a href="Reading%20law">read the law</a> with his father, a state judge at the time, and later with <a href="Edmund%20Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">United States Attorney General</a>. Tyler was erroneously <a href="Admission%20to%20practice%20law">admitted</a> to the Virginia bar at the premature age of 19—the admitting judge neglected to ask his age. By this time his father was serving as <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a> (1808–1811), and the young Tyler started a practice in Richmond, the state capital. In 1813 he purchased <a href="Woodburn%20%28Charles%20City%2C%20Virginia%29">Woodburn plantation</a>, and resided there until 1821.

In 1811, at age 21, Tyler was elected to represent Charles City County in the House of Delegates. He served five successive one-year terms and sat on the Courts and Justice committee. The young politician's defining positions were on display by the end of his first term in 1816—strong, staunch support of <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> and opposition to a national bank. He joined fellow legislator <a href="Benjamin%20W.%20Leigh">Benjamin W. Leigh</a> in supporting the censure of U.S. senators <a href="William%20Branch%20Giles">William Branch Giles</a> and <a href="Richard%20Brent%20%28Virginia%29">Richard Brent</a> of Virginia who had, against the Virginia legislature's instructions, voted for the recharter of the <a href="First%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Bank of the United States</a>.

Tyler, like most Americans of his day, was anti-British, and at the onset of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> he urged support for military action in a speech to the House of Delegates. After the British capture of <a href="Hampton%2C%20Virginia">Hampton, Virginia</a> in the summer of 1813, Tyler eagerly organized a militia company, the Charles City Rifles, to defend Richmond, which he commanded with the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a>. No attack came, and he dissolved the company two months later. For his military service, Tyler received a land grant near what later became <a href="Sioux%20City%2C%20Iowa">Sioux City, Iowa</a>.

Tyler's father died in 1813, and Tyler inherited thirteen slaves along with his father's plantation. In 1816, he resigned his legislative seat to serve on the Governor's <a href="Council%20of%20State">Council of State</a>, a group of eight advisers elected by the General Assembly.

The death of U.S. Representative <a href="John%20Clopton">John Clopton</a> in September 1816 created a vacancy in <a href="Virginia%27s%2023rd%20congressional%20district">Virginia's 23rd congressional district</a>. Tyler sought the seat, as did his friend and political ally <a href="Andrew%20Stevenson">Andrew Stevenson</a>. Since the two men were politically alike, the race was for the most part a popularity contest. Tyler's political connections and campaigning skills narrowly won him the election. He was sworn into the <a href="14th%20United%20States%20Congress">Fourteenth Congress</a> on December 17, 1816, to serve as a Democratic-Republican, the major political party in the <a href="Era%20of%20Good%20Feelings">Era of Good Feelings</a>.

While the Democratic-Republicans had supported states' rights, in the wake of the War of 1812 many members urged a stronger central government. A majority in Congress wanted to see the federal government help to fund <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> such as ports and roadways. Tyler held fast to his <a href="strict%20constructionism">strict constructionist</a> beliefs, rejecting such proposals on both constitutional and personal grounds. He believed each state should construct necessary projects within its borders using locally generated funds. Virginia was not "in so poor a condition as to require a "charitable" donation from Congress", he contended. He was chosen to participate in an audit of the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> in 1818 as part of a five-man committee, and was appalled by corruption he perceived within the bank. He argued for the revocation of the bank charter, although Congress rejected any such proposal. His first clash with General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> followed <a href="Jackson%20incursion">Jackson's 1818 invasion of Florida</a> during the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>. While praising Jackson's character, Tyler condemned him as overzealous for <a href="Arbuthnot%20and%20Ambrister%20incident">the execution of two British subjects</a>. Tyler was elected for a full term without opposition in early 1819.

The major issue of the <a href="16th%20United%20States%20Congress">Sixteenth Congress</a> (1819–21) was whether <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> should be admitted to the Union, and whether slavery would be permitted in the new state. Acknowledging the ills of slavery, he hoped that by letting it expand, there would be fewer slaves in the east as slave and master journeyed west, making it feasible to consider abolishing the institution in Virginia. Thus, slavery would be abolished through the action of individual states as the practice became rare, as had been done in some Northern states. Tyler believed that Congress did not have the power to regulate slavery and that admitting states based on whether they were slave or free was a recipe for sectional conflict; therefore, the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> was enacted without Tyler's support. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free one, and it also forbade slavery in states formed from the northern part of <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">the territories</a>. Throughout his time in Congress, he voted against bills which would restrict slavery in the territories.

Tyler declined to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his dissatisfaction with the position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education would be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.

Restless and bored after two years at home practicing law, Tyler sought election to the House of Delegates in 1823. Neither member from Charles City County was seeking re-election, and Tyler was elected easily that April, finishing first among the three candidates seeking the two seats. At the term's start in December, he found the chamber in debate over the impending <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">presidential election of 1824</a>. The <a href="congressional%20nominating%20caucus">congressional nominating caucus</a>, an early system for choosing presidential candidates, was still used despite its growing unpopularity. Tyler tried to convince the lower house to endorse the caucus system and choose <a href="William%20H.%20Crawford">William H. Crawford</a> as the Democratic-Republican candidate. Crawford captured the legislature's support, but Tyler's proposal was defeated. His most enduring effort in this second legislative tenure was saving the College of William and Mary, which risked closure from waning enrollment. Rather than move it from rural Williamsburg to the populous capital of Richmond, as some suggested, Tyler proposed that a series of administrative and financial reforms be enacted. These were passed into law and were successful; by 1840 the school achieved its highest-ever enrollment.

Tyler's political fortunes were growing; he was considered as a possible candidate in the legislative deliberation for the 1824 U.S. Senate election. He was nominated in December 1825 for governor of Virginia, a position which was then appointed by the legislature. Tyler was elected 131–81 over <a href="John%20Floyd%20%28Virginia%20politician%29">John Floyd</a>. The office of governor was powerless under the original <a href="Virginia%20Constitution">Virginia Constitution</a> (1776–1830), lacking even veto authority. Tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could do little to influence the legislature. His most visible act as governor was delivering the funeral address for former president Jefferson, a Virginian, who had died on July 4, 1826. Tyler was deeply devoted to Jefferson, and his eloquent eulogy was well received.

Tyler's governorship was otherwise uneventful. He promoted states' rights and adamantly opposed any concentration of federal power. In order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals, he suggested Virginia actively expand its own road system. A proposal was made to expand the state's poorly funded public school system, but no significant action was taken. Tyler was re-elected unanimously to a second one-year term in December 1826.

In 1829, Tyler was elected as a delegate to the <a href="Virginia%20Constitutional%20Convention%20of%201829-1830">Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830</a> from the Senate District that included Chief Justice <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>. He was appointed to the Committee on the Legislature. His service in various capacities at a state level included as president of the Virginia <a href="Colonization%20Society">Colonization Society</a>, and as rector and chancellor of the <a href="College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a>.

In January 1827, the General Assembly considered whether to elect U.S. Senator <a href="John%20Randolph%20of%20Roanoke">John Randolph</a> for a full six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held by most of the Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on the Senate floor, which put his allies in an awkward position. Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, but the political pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more agreeable than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.

By the time of Tyler's senatorial election, the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828 campaign for president</a> was in progress. Adams, the incumbent president, was challenged by Gen. Andrew Jackson. The Democratic-Republicans had splintered into Adams' <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republicans</a> and Jackson's <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>. Tyler disliked both candidates for their willingness to increase the power of the federal government, but he was increasingly drawn to Jackson, hoping that he would not seek to spend as much federal money on internal improvements as Adams. of Jackson he wrote, "Turning to him I may at least indulge in hope; looking on Adams I must despair."

When the <a href="20th%20United%20States%20Congress">Twentieth Congress</a> began in December 1827, Tyler served alongside his Virginia colleague and friend <a href="Littleton%20Waller%20Tazewell">Littleton Waller Tazewell</a>, who shared his strict constructionist views and uneasy support of Jackson. Throughout his tenure, Sen. Tyler vigorously opposed national infrastructure bills, feeling these were matters for individual states to decide. He and his Southern colleagues unsuccessfully opposed the protectionist <a href="Tariff%20of%201828">Tariff of 1828</a>, known to its detractors as the "Tariff of Abominations". Tyler suggested that the Tariff's only positive outcome would be a national political backlash, restoring a respect for states' rights. Tyler remained a strong supporter of states' rights, stating "they may strike the Federal Government out of existence by a word; demolish the Constitution and scatter its fragments to the winds".

Tyler was soon at odds with President Jackson, frustrated by Jackson's newly emerging <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>, describing it as an "electioneering weapon". He voted against many of the President's nominations when they appeared to be unconstitutional or motivated by patronage. Opposing the nominations of a president of his own party was considered "an act of insurgency" against his party. Tyler was particularly offended by Jackson's use of the <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> power to name three treaty commissioners to meet with emissaries from the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, and introduced a bill chastising the president for this.

In some matters Tyler was on good terms with Jackson. He defended Jackson for <a href="Maysville%20Road%20veto">vetoing the Maysville Road funding project</a>, which Jackson considered unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as <a href="United%20States%20Minister%20to%20Britain">United States Minister to Britain</a>. The leading issue in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832 presidential election</a> was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson vetoed the bill for both constitutional and practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.

Tyler's uneasy relationship with his party came to a head during the <a href="22nd%20United%20States%20Congress">22nd Congress</a>, as the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33 began. South Carolina, threatening <a href="secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a>, passed the <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Nullification">Ordinance of Nullification</a> in November 1832, declaring the "Tariff of Abominations" null and void within its borders. This raised the constitutional question of whether states could nullify federal laws. President Jackson, who denied such a right, prepared to sign a <a href="Force%20Bill">Force Bill</a> allowing the federal government to use military action to enforce the tariff. Tyler, who sympathized with South Carolina's reasons for nullification, rejected Jackson's use of military force against a state and gave a speech in February 1833 outlining his views. He supported Clay's <a href="Compromise%20Tariff%20of%201833">Compromise Tariff</a>, enacted that year, to gradually reduce the tariff over ten years, alleviating tensions between the states and the federal government.

In voting against the Force Bill, Tyler knew he would permanently alienate the pro-Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature, even those who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point. This jeopardized <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201832">his re-election in February 1833</a>, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat <a href="James%20McDowell">James McDowell</a>; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected by a margin of 12 votes.

Jackson further offended Tyler by moving to dissolve the Bank by executive fiat. In September 1833, Jackson issued an executive order directing Treasury Secretary <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a> to transfer federal funds from the Bank to state-chartered banks without delay. Tyler saw this as "a flagrant assumption of power", a breach of contract, and a threat to the economy. After months of agonizing, he decided to join with Jackson's opponents. Sitting on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Finance">Senate Finance Committee</a>, he voted for two censure resolutions against the president in March 1834. By this time, Tyler had become affiliated with Clay's newly formed <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>, which held control of the Senate. On March 3, 1835, with only hours remaining in the <a href="23rd%20United%20States%20Congress">congressional session</a>, the Whigs voted Tyler <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">President "pro tempore" of the Senate</a> as a symbolic gesture of approval. He is the only U.S. president to have held this office.

Shortly thereafter, the Democrats took control of the Virginia House of Delegates. Tyler was offered a judgeship in exchange for resigning his seat, but he declined. Tyler understood what was to come: he would soon be forced by the legislature to cast a vote that went against his constitutional beliefs. Senator <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a> of Missouri had introduced a bill expunging the censure of Jackson. By resolution of the Democratic-controlled legislature, Tyler could be instructed to vote for the bill. If he disregarded the instructions, he would be violating his own principles: "the first act of my political life was a censure on Messrs. Giles and Brent for opposition to instructions", he noted. Over the next few months he sought the counsel of his friends, who gave him conflicting advice. By mid-February he felt that his Senate career was likely at an end. He issued a letter of resignation to the Vice President, Van Buren, on February 29, 1836, saying in part:

While Tyler wished to attend to his private life and family, he was soon occupied with the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201836">presidential election of 1836.</a> He had been suggested as a vice presidential candidate since early 1835, and the same day the Virginia Democrats issued the expunging instruction, the Virginia Whigs nominated him as their candidate. The new Whig Party was not organized enough to hold a national convention and name a single ticket against Van Buren, Jackson's chosen successor. Instead, Whigs in various regions put forth their own preferred tickets, reflecting the party's tenuous coalition: the Massachusetts Whigs nominated <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a> and <a href="Francis%20Granger">Francis Granger</a>, the <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masons</a> of the Northern and border states backed William Henry Harrison and Granger, and the states' rights advocates of the middle and lower South nominated <a href="Hugh%20Lawson%20White">Hugh Lawson White</a> and John Tyler. In Maryland, the Whig ticket was Harrison and Tyler and in South Carolina it was <a href="Willie%20P.%20Mangum">Willie P. Mangum</a> and Tyler. The Whigs wanted to deny Van Buren a majority in the Electoral College, throwing the election into the House of Representatives, where deals could be made. Tyler hoped electors would be unable to elect a vice president, and that he would be one of the top two vote-getters, from whom the Senate, under the <a href="Twelfth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a>, must choose.

Following the custom of the times—that candidates not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a> of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for the only time in American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.

Tyler had been drawn into Virginia politics even as a U.S. Senator. From October 1829 to January 1830, he served as a member of the <a href="Virginia%20Conventions">state constitutional convention</a>, a role which he had been reluctant to accept. The original <a href="Virginia%20Constitution">Virginia Constitution</a> gave outsize influence to the state's more conservative eastern counties, as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county (regardless of population) and only granted suffrage to property owners. The convention gave the more populous and liberal counties of western Virginia an opportunity to expand their influence. Tyler, a slaveowner from eastern Virginia, supported the existing system. He largely remained on the sidelines during the debate, however, not wishing to alienate any of the state's political factions. He was focused on his Senate career, which required a broad base of support, and gave speeches during the convention promoting compromise and unity.

After the 1836 election, Tyler thought his political career was at an end, and planned to return to private law practice. In the fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in Williamsburg. Unable to remain away from politics, Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates and took his seat in 1838. He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.

Tyler's successor in the Senate was <a href="William%20Cabell%20Rives">William Cabell Rives</a>, a conservative Democrat. In February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, which was to expire the following month. Rives had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found Rives a more politically expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split among three candidates, including Rives and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.

When the <a href="1839%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1839 Whig National Convention</a> convened in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a> to choose the party's ticket, the United States was in the third year of a serious recession following the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. President Van Buren's ineffective efforts to deal with the situation cost him public support. With the Democratic Party torn into factions, the head of the Whig ticket would likely be the next president. Harrison, Clay, and General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> all sought the nomination. Tyler attended the convention and was with the Virginia delegation, although he had no official status. Because of bitterness over the unresolved Senate election, the Virginia delegation refused to make Tyler its <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidate for vice president. Tyler himself did nothing to aid his chances. If his favored candidate for the presidential nomination, Clay, were successful, he would likely not be chosen for the second place on the ticket, which would probably go to a Northerner to assure geographic balance.

The convention deadlocked among the three main candidates, with Virginia's votes going to Clay. Many Northern Whigs opposed Clay, and some, including Pennsylvania's <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, showed the Virginians a letter written by Scott in which he apparently displayed abolitionist sentiments. The influential Virginia delegation then announced that Harrison was its second choice, causing most Scott supporters to abandon him in favor of Harrison, who gained the presidential nomination.

The vice presidential nomination was considered <a href="wikt%3Aimmaterial">immaterial</a>; no president had failed to complete his elected term. Not much attention was given to the choice, and the specifics of how Tyler came to gain it are unclear. Chitwood pointed out that Tyler was a logical candidate: as a Southern slaveowner, he balanced the ticket and also assuaged the fears of Southerners who felt Harrison might have abolitionist leanings. Tyler had been a vice-presidential candidate in 1836, and having him on the ticket might win Virginia, the most populous state in the South. One of the convention managers, New York publisher <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>, alleged that "Tyler was finally taken because we could get nobody else to accept"—though he did not say this until after the subsequent break between President Tyler and the Whig Party. Other Tyler foes claimed that he had wept himself into the White House, after crying at Clay's defeat; this was unlikely, as the Kentuckian had backed Tyler's opponent Rives in the Senate election. Tyler's name was submitted in the balloting, and though Virginia abstained, he received the necessary majority. Tyler, as president, was accused of having gained the nomination by concealing his views, and responded that he had not been asked about them. His biographer, Robert Seager II, held that Tyler was selected because of a dearth of alternative candidates. Seager concluded, "He was put on the ticket to draw the South to Harrison. No more, no less."

There was no Whig <a href="party%20platform">platform</a>—the party leaders decided that trying to put one together would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on their opposition to Van Buren, blaming him and his Democrats for the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided the issue of the Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.

To win the election, Whig leaders decided they had to mobilize people across the country, including women, who could not then vote. This was the first time that an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale, and women in Tyler's Virginia were active on his behalf. The party hoped to avoid issues and win through public enthusiasm, with torchlight processions and alcohol-fueled political rallies. The interest in the campaign was unprecedented, with many public events. When the Democratic press depicted Harrison as an old soldier, who would turn aside from his campaign if given a barrel of <a href="hard%20cider">hard cider</a> to drink in his <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>, the Whigs eagerly seized on the image, and the <a href="log%20cabin%20campaign">log cabin campaign</a> was born. The fact that Harrison lived on a palatial estate along the Ohio River and that Tyler was well-to-do were ignored, while log cabin images appeared everywhere, from banners to whiskey bottles. Cider was the favored beverage of many farmers and tradesmen, and Whigs claimed that Harrison preferred that drink of the common man. Democrats complained that the Harrison/Tyler campaign's liberal provision of hard cider at rallies was encouraging drunkenness.

The presidential candidate's military service was emphasized, thus the well known campaign jingle, "<a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20Too">Tippecanoe and Tyler Too</a>", referring to Harrison's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</a>. <a href="Glee%20club">Glee club</a>s sprouted all over the country, singing patriotic and inspirational songs: one Democratic editor stated that he found the songfests in support of the Whig Party to be unforgettable. Among the lyrics sung were "We shall vote for Tyler therefore/Without a why or wherefore". Louis Hatch, in his history of the vice presidency, noted, "the Whigs roared, sang, and hard-cidered the 'hero of Tippecanoe' into the White House".

Clay, though embittered by another of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's withdrawal from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 percent of the popular vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.

As <a href="Vice%20President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president-elect</a>, Tyler remained quietly at his home in Williamsburg. He privately expressed hopes that Harrison would prove decisive and not allow intrigue in the Cabinet, especially in the first days of the administration. Tyler did not participate in selecting the Cabinet, and did not recommend anyone for federal office in the new Whig administration. Harrison, beset by office seekers and the demands of Senator Clay, twice sent letters to Tyler asking his advice as to whether a Van Buren appointee should be dismissed. In both cases, Tyler recommended against, and Harrison wrote, "Mr. Tyler says they ought not to be removed, and I will not remove them." The two men met briefly in Richmond in February, and reviewed a parade together, though they did not discuss politics.

Tyler was sworn in on March 4, 1841, in the Senate chamber, and delivered a three-minute speech about states' rights before swearing in the new senators and attending <a href="Inauguration%20of%20William%20Henry%20Harrison">President Harrison's inauguration</a>. Following Harrison's two-hour speech on that freezing March 4, the Vice President returned to the Senate to receive the President's Cabinet nominations, presiding over the confirmations the following day—a total of two hours as President of the Senate. Expecting few responsibilities, he then left Washington, quietly returning to his home in Williamsburg. Seager later wrote, "Had William Henry Harrison lived, John Tyler would undoubtedly have been as obscure as any vice-president in American history."

Harrison, meanwhile, struggled to keep up with the demands of Henry Clay and others who sought offices and influence in his administration. Harrison's old age and fading health were no secret during the campaign, and the question of the presidential succession was on every politician's mind. The first few weeks of the presidency took a toll on Harrison's health, and after being caught in a rainstorm in late March he came down with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>. Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word to Tyler of Harrison's illness on April 1; two days later, Richmond attorney James Lyons wrote with the news that the president had taken a turn for the worse, remarking that "I shall not be surprised to hear by tomorrow's mail that Gen'l Harrison is no more." Tyler determined not to travel to Washington, not wanting to appear unseemly in anticipating the president's death. At dawn on April 5, Webster's son <a href="Fletcher%20Webster">Fletcher</a>, Chief Clerk of the State Department, arrived at Tyler's plantation with a letter from Webster, informing the new president of Harrison's death the morning before.

Harrison's death in office was an unprecedented event that caused considerable uncertainty regarding presidential succession. <a href="Article%20Two%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article II, Section 1, Clause 6</a> of the United States Constitution, which governed intra-term presidential succession at the time (now superseded by the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment</a>), states that:

Interpreting this Constitutional prescription led to the question of whether the actual office of president devolved upon Vice President Tyler, or merely its powers and duties. The Cabinet met within an hour of Harrison's death and, according to a later account, determined that Tyler would be "Vice-President acting President". However, Tyler firmly and decisively asserted that the Constitution gave him full and unqualified powers of office and had himself sworn in immediately as President, setting a critical precedent for an orderly transfer of power following a President's death. The <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States%20oath%20of%20office">presidential oath</a> was administered by Judge <a href="William%20Cranch">William Cranch</a> in Tyler's hotel room. He considered the oath redundant to his oath as vice president, but wished to quell any doubt over his accession. When he took office, Tyler, at 51, became the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20age">youngest</a> president to that point.

"Fearing that he would alienate Harrison's supporters, Tyler decided to keep the dead President's entire cabinet even though several members were openly hostile to him and resented his assumption of the office." At his first cabinet meeting, Webster informed him of Harrison's practice of making policy by a majority vote. (This was a dubious assertion, since Harrison had held few cabinet meetings and had baldly asserted his authority over the cabinet in at least one.) The Cabinet fully expected the new president to continue this practice. Tyler was astounded and immediately corrected them:
Tyler delivered an inaugural address before the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> on April 9, in which he reasserted his belief in fundamental tenets of <a href="Jeffersonian%20democracy">Jeffersonian democracy</a> and limited federal power. Tyler's claim to be president was not immediately accepted by <a href="Opposition%20%28parliamentary%29">opposition</a> members of Congress such as <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, who felt that Tyler should be a <a href="Caretaker%20government%23Caretakers">caretaker</a> under the title of <a href="Acting%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">"Acting President"</a>, or remain vice president in name. Among those who questioned Tyler's authority was Clay, who had planned to be "the real power behind a fumbling throne" while Harrison was alive, and intended the same for Tyler. Clay saw Tyler as the "vice-president" and his presidency as a mere "<a href="regent">regency</a>".
Ratification of the decision by Congress came through the customary notification that it makes to the president, that it is in session and available to receive messages. In both houses, unsuccessful amendments were offered to strike the word "president" in favor of language including the term "vice president" to refer to Tyler. Mississippi Senator <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a>, in opposition, stated that the idea that Tyler was still vice president and could preside over the Senate was absurd.

Tyler's opponents never fully accepted him as president. He was referred to by many mocking nicknames, including "His Accidency". However, Tyler never wavered from his conviction that he was the rightful president; when his political opponents sent correspondence to the White House addressed to the "vice president" or "acting president", Tyler had it returned unopened.

Harrison had been expected to adhere to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders, particularly Clay. When Tyler succeeded him, he initially concurred with the new Whig Congress, signing into law the <a href="Preemption%20Act%20of%201841">preemption bill</a> granting "squatters' sovereignty" to settlers on public land, a Distribution Act (discussed below), a new bankruptcy law, and the repeal of the <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a>. But when it came to the great banking question, Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs, and twice vetoed Clay's legislation for a national banking act. Although the second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in the first veto, its final version did not. This practice, designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844, became known as "heading Captain Tyler", a term coined by Whig Representative <a href="John%20Minor%20Botts">John Minor Botts</a> of Virginia. Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as the "Exchequer", but Clay's friends who controlled the Congress would have none of it.

On September 11, 1841 after the second bank veto, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office one by one and resigned—an orchestration by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President "pro tempore" <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Southard">Samuel L. Southard</a>, in the White House. The only exception was Webster, who remained to finalize what became the 1842 <a href="Webster%E2%80%93Ashburton%20Treaty">Webster–Ashburton Treaty</a>, and to demonstrate his independence from Clay. When told by Webster that he was willing to stay, Tyler is reported to have said, "Give me your hand on that, and now I will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man." On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party. Tyler was lambasted by Whig newspapers and received hundreds of letters threatening his assassination. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.

By mid-1841, the federal government faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished to stay within the 20 percent rate created by the <a href="Compromise%20Tariff%20of%201833">1833 Compromise Tariff</a>. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that the federal government was still in dire fiscal straits.

The root of the trouble was an economic crisis—initiated by the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A <a href="speculative%20bubble">speculative bubble</a> had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states that there would be a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.

The defiant Whig Congress would not raise tariffs in a way that would affect the distribution of funds to states. In June 1842 they passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program. Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff, Tyler vetoed both bills, burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs. Congress tried again, combining the two into one bill; Tyler vetoed it again, to the dismay of many in Congress, who nevertheless failed to override the veto. As some action was necessary, Whigs in Congress, led by the <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means">House Ways and Means</a> chairman <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, passed in each house (by one vote) a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program. Tyler signed the <a href="Tariff%20of%201842">Tariff of 1842</a> on August 30, <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>ing a separate bill to restore distribution.

Shortly after the tariff vetoes, Whigs in the House of Representatives initiated that body's first <a href="Impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States">impeachment</a> proceedings against a president. The congressional ill will towards Tyler derived from the basis for his vetoes; until the presidency of the Whigs' arch-enemy Andrew Jackson, presidents rarely vetoed bills, and then only on grounds of constitutionality. Tyler's actions were in opposition to the presumed authority of Congress to make policy. Congressman <a href="John%20Botts">John Botts</a>, who opposed Tyler, introduced an impeachment resolution on July 10, 1842. It levied several charges against Tyler and called for a nine-member committee to investigate his behavior, with the expectation of a formal impeachment recommendation. Clay found this measure prematurely aggressive, and favored a more moderate progression toward Tyler's "inevitable" impeachment. The Botts resolution was tabled until the following January when it was rejected by a vote of 127 to 83.

A House <a href="select%20committee">select committee</a> headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's use of the veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored a constitutional amendment to change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent <a href="28th%20United%20States%20Congress">28th Congress</a>—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to <a href="United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service">revenue cutters</a>—the first override of a presidential veto.

The battles between Tyler and the Whigs in Congress resulted in a number of his cabinet nominees being rejected. He received little support from Democrats and, without much support from either major party in Congress, a number of his nominations were rejected without regard for the qualifications of the nominee. It was then unprecedented to reject a president's nominees for his Cabinet (though in 1809, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> withheld the nomination of <a href="Albert%20Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a> as Secretary of State because of opposition in the Senate). Four of Tyler's Cabinet nominees were rejected, the most of any president. These were <a href="Caleb%20Cushing">Caleb Cushing</a> (Treasury), <a href="David%20Henshaw%20%28American%20politician%29">David Henshaw</a> (Navy) <a href="James%20Madison%20Porter">James Porter</a> (War), and <a href="James%20S.%20Green%20%28attorney%29">James S. Green</a> (Treasury). Henshaw and Porter served as recess appointees before their rejections. Tyler repeatedly renominated Cushing, who was rejected three times in one day, March 3, 1843, the last day of the 27th Congress. No cabinet nomination failed after Tyler's term until <a href="Henry%20Stanbery">Henry Stanbery</a>'s nomination as Attorney General was rejected by the Senate in 1868.

Tyler's difficulties in domestic policy contrasted with notable accomplishments in foreign policy. He had long been an advocate of <a href="expansionism">expansionism</a> toward the Pacific and <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>, and was fond of evoking themes of national destiny and the spread of liberty in support of these policies. His positions were largely in line with Jackson's earlier efforts to promote American commerce across the Pacific. Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets, he sent lawyer <a href="Caleb%20Cushing">Caleb Cushing</a> to China, where he negotiated the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wanghia">Treaty of Wanghia</a> (1844). The same year, he sent <a href="Henry%20Wheaton">Henry Wheaton</a> as a minister to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, where he negotiated and signed a trade agreement with the "<a href="Zollverein">Zollverein</a>", a coalition of German states that managed tariffs. This treaty was rejected by the Whigs, mainly as a show of hostility toward the Tyler administration.

In an 1842 special message to Congress, the president also applied the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> to Hawaii (dubbed the "Tyler Doctrine"), told Britain not to interfere there, and began a process that led to the eventual annexation of Hawaii by the United States.

In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster negotiated with Britain the <a href="Webster%E2%80%93Ashburton%20Treaty">Webster–Ashburton Treaty</a>, which determined the border between Maine and Canada. That issue had caused tension between the United States and Britain for decades and had brought the two countries to the brink of war on several occasions. Though the treaty improved Anglo-American diplomatic relations, Tyler was nevertheless unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon. On Tyler's last full day in office, March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state.

Tyler advocated an increase in military strength and this drew praise from naval leaders, who saw a marked increase in warships. Tyler brought the long, bloody <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a> to an end in 1842, and expressed interest in the forced cultural assimilation of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>. He also advocated the establishment of a chain of American forts from <a href="Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa">Council Bluffs, Iowa</a> to the Pacific.

In May 1842 when the <a href="Dorr%20Rebellion">Dorr Rebellion</a> in Rhode Island came to a head, Tyler pondered the request of the governor and legislature to send in federal troops to help suppress it. The insurgents under <a href="Thomas%20Wilson%20Dorr">Thomas Dorr</a> had armed themselves and proposed to install a new state constitution. Before such acts, Rhode Island had been following the same constitutional structure that was established in 1663. Tyler called for calm on both sides, and recommended that the governor enlarge the franchise to let most men vote. Tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in Rhode Island he would employ force to aid the regular, or Charter, government. He made it clear that federal assistance would be given only to put down an insurrection once underway, and would not be available until violence had taken place. After listening to reports from his confidential agents, Tyler decided that the 'lawless assemblages' had dispersed and expressed his confidence in a "temper of conciliation as well as of energy and decision" without need of federal forces. The rebels fled the state when the state militia marched against them, but the incident led to broader suffrage in the state.

Two vacancies occurred on the Supreme Court during Tyler's presidency, as Justices <a href="Smith%20Thompson">Smith Thompson</a> and <a href="Henry%20Baldwin%20%28judge%29">Henry Baldwin</a> died in 1843 and 1844, respectively. Tyler, ever at odds with Congress—including the Whig-controlled Senate—nominated several men to the Supreme Court to fill these seats. However, the Senate successively voted against confirming <a href="John%20C.%20Spencer">John C. Spencer</a>, <a href="Reuben%20Walworth">Reuben Walworth</a>, <a href="Edward%20King%20%28jurist%29">Edward King</a> and <a href="John%20M.%20Read">John M. Read</a> (Walworth was rejected three times, King rejected twice). One reason cited for the Senate's actions was the hope that Clay would fill the vacancies after winning the 1844 presidential election. Tyler's four unsuccessful nominees are the most by a president.

Finally, in February 1845, with less than a month remaining in his term, Tyler's nomination of <a href="Samuel%20Nelson">Samuel Nelson</a> to Thompson's seat was confirmed by the Senate—Nelson, a Democrat, had a reputation as a careful and noncontroversial jurist. Still, his confirmation came as a surprise. Baldwin's seat remained vacant until <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>'s nominee, <a href="Robert%20Cooper%20Grier">Robert Grier</a>, was confirmed in 1846.

Tyler was able to appoint only six other federal judges, all to <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a>s.

Tyler made the annexation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> part of his agenda soon after becoming president. Texas had declared independence from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> in the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> of 1836, although Mexico still refused to acknowledge its sovereignty. The people of Texas actively pursued joining the Union, but Jackson and Van Buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another Southern state. Though Tyler intended annexation to be the focal point of his administration, Secretary Webster was opposed, and convinced Tyler to concentrate on Pacific initiatives until later in his term. Tyler's desire for western expansionism is acknowledged by historians and scholars, but views differ regarding the motivations behind it. Biographer Edward C. Crapol notes that during the presidency of <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, Tyler (then in the House of Representatives) had suggested slavery was a "dark cloud" hovering over the Union, and that it would be "well to disperse this cloud" so that with fewer blacks in the older slave states, a process of gradual emancipation would begin in Virginia and other upper Southern states. Historian William W. Freehling, however, wrote that Tyler's official motivation in annexing Texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> to promote an emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution in the United States.

In early 1843, having completed the Webster–Ashburton treaty and other diplomatic efforts, Tyler felt ready to pursue Texas. Now lacking a party base, he saw annexation of the republic as his only pathway to independent re-election in 1844. For the first time in his career he was willing to play "political hardball" to see it through. As a <a href="trial%20balloon">trial balloon</a> he dispatched his ally <a href="Thomas%20Walker%20Gilmer">Thomas Walker Gilmer</a>, then a U.S. Representative from Virginia, to publish a letter defending annexation, which was well received. Despite his successful relationship with Webster, Tyler knew he would need a Secretary of State who supported the Texas initiative. With the work on the British treaty now completed, he forced Webster's resignation and installed <a href="Hugh%20S.%20Legar%C3%A9">Hugh S. Legaré</a> of South Carolina as an interim successor.

With the help of newly appointed Treasury Secretary <a href="John%20C.%20Spencer">John C. Spencer</a>, Tyler cleared out an array of officeholders, replacing them with pro-annexation partisans, in a reversal of his former stand against patronage. He elicited the help of political organizer <a href="Michael%20Walsh%20%28New%20York%29">Michael Walsh</a> to build a <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> in New York. In exchange for an appointment as <a href="United%20States%20Minister%20to%20Hawaii">consul to Hawaii</a>, journalist Alexander G. Abell wrote a flattering biography, "Life of John Tyler", which was printed in large quantities and given to postmasters to distribute. Seeking to rehabilitate his public image, Tyler embarked on a nationwide tour in the spring of 1843. The positive reception of the public at these events contrasted with his ostracism back in Washington. The tour centered on the dedication of the <a href="Bunker%20Hill%20Monument">Bunker Hill Monument</a> in Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly after the dedication, Tyler learned of Legaré's sudden death, which dampened the festivities and caused him to cancel the rest of the tour.

Tyler appointed <a href="Abel%20P.%20Upshur">Abel P. Upshur</a>, a popular <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> and close adviser, as his new Secretary of State, and nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur's former office. Tyler and Upshur began quiet negotiations with the Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico in exchange for a commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to garner support among Northern voters, who were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state. By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that he had found a large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty. The republic remained skeptical, and finalization of the treaty took until the end of February.

A ceremonial cruise down the Potomac River was held aboard the newly built on February 28, 1844, the day after completion of the annexation treaty. Aboard the ship were 400 guests, including Tyler and his cabinet, as was the world's largest naval gun, the "Peacemaker". The gun was ceremoniously fired several times in the afternoon to the great delight of the onlookers, who then filed downstairs to offer a toast. Several hours later, Captain <a href="Robert%20F.%20Stockton">Robert F. Stockton</a> was convinced by the crowd to fire one more shot. As the guests moved up to the deck, Tyler paused briefly to watch his son-in-law, William Waller, sing a ditty.

At once an explosion was heard from above: the gun had malfunctioned. Tyler was unhurt, having remained safely below deck, but a number of others were killed instantly, including his crucial cabinet members, Gilmer and Upshur. Also killed or mortally wounded were <a href="Virgil%20Maxcy">Virgil Maxcy</a> of Maryland, Rep. <a href="David%20Gardiner%20%28politician%29">David Gardiner</a> of New York, Commodore <a href="Beverley%20Kennon">Beverley Kennon</a>, Chief of Construction of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and Armistead, Tyler's black slave and body servant. The death of David Gardiner had a devastating effect on his daughter, <a href="Julia%20Gardiner%20Tyler">Julia</a>, who fainted and was carried to safety by the president himself. Julia later recovered from her grief and married Tyler.

For Tyler, any hope of completing the Texas plan before November (and with it, any hope of re-election) was instantly dashed. Historian Edward P. Crapol later wrote that "Prior to the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln", the "Princeton" disaster "unquestionably was the most severe and debilitating tragedy ever to confront a President of the United States".

In what the <a href="Miller%20Center%20of%20Public%20Affairs">Miller Center of Public Affairs</a> considers "a serious tactical error that ruined the scheme [of establishing political respectability for him]", Tyler appointed former Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a> in early March 1844 as his Secretary of State. Tyler's good friend, Virginia Representative <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wise">Henry A. Wise</a>, wrote that following the "Princeton" disaster, Wise on his own volition extended Calhoun the position as a self-appointed emissary of the president and Calhoun accepted. When Wise went to tell Tyler what he had done, the president was angry but felt that the action had to stand. Calhoun was a leading advocate of slavery, and his attempts to get an annexation treaty passed were resisted by abolitionists as a result. When the text of the treaty was leaked to the public, it met political opposition from the Whigs, who opposed anything that might enhance Tyler's status, as well as from foes of slavery and those who feared a confrontation with Mexico, which had announced that it would view annexation as a hostile act by the United States. Both Clay and Van Buren, the respective frontrunners for the Whig and Democratic nominations, decided in a private meeting at Van Buren's home to come out against annexation. Knowing this, Tyler was pessimistic when he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification in April 1844.

Following Tyler's break with the Whigs in 1841, he attempted a return to his old Democratic party, but its members, especially the followers of Van Buren, were not ready to accept him. He knew that, with little chance of election, the only way to salvage his presidential legacy was to move public opinion in favor of the Texas issue. He formed a third party, the Democratic-Republicans, using the officeholders and political networks he had built over the previous year. Multiple supportive newspapers across the country issued editorials promoting his candidacy throughout the early months of 1844. Reports of meetings held throughout the country suggest that support for the president was not limited to officeholders, as is widely assumed. Just as the Democratic Party was holding its presidential nomination in Baltimore, Maryland, the Tyler supporters, in that very city, were holding signs reading "Tyler and Texas!", and with their own high visibility and energy they gave Tyler their nomination. His new Democratic-Republican Party renominated Tyler for the presidency on May 27, 1844.

Regular Democrats were forced to call for annexation of Texas in their platform, but there was a bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.

Tyler was unfazed when the Whig-controlled Senate rejected his treaty by a vote of 16–35 in June 1844; he felt that annexation was now within reach by joint resolution rather than by treaty, and made that request to the congress. Former President Andrew Jackson, a staunch supporter of annexation, persuaded Polk to welcome Tyler back into the Democratic party and ordered Democratic editors to cease their attacks on him. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Polk's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">narrow victory</a> over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a <a href="mandate%20%28politics%29">mandate</a> for completing the resolution. Tyler announced in his annual message to Congress that "a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declared in favor of immediate annexation". In late February 1845, the House approved a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas by a substantial margin—the Senate approved by a bare 27–25 majority, and three days before the end of his term, Tyler signed the bill into law. After some debate, Texas accepted the terms and entered the union on December 29, 1845, as the 28th state.

Tyler fathered more children than any other American president. His first wife was <a href="Letitia%20Christian%20Tyler">Letitia Christian</a> (November 12, 1790 – September 10, 1842), with whom he had eight children: Mary (1815–1847), <a href="Robert%20Tyler%20%28Confederate%20Register%20of%20the%20Treasury%29">Robert</a> (1816–1877), John (1819–1896), Letitia (1821–1907), Elizabeth (1823–1850), Anne (1825–1825), Alice (1827–1854) and Tazewell (1830–1874).

Although Tyler's family was dear to him, during his political rise he was often away from home for extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he wrote that he would soon be called upon to educate his growing family. It was difficult to practice law while away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.

Tyler was a <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaveholder</a>, at one point keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he regarded slavery as an evil, and did not attempt to justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a>, and therefore the <a href="United%20States%20Federal%20Government">federal government</a> lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that he cared for their well-being and abstained from physical violence against them. In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher <a href="Joshua%20Leavitt">Joshua Leavitt</a>, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but there is no evidence of such genealogy.

, Tyler has two living grandsons through his son Lyon Gardiner Tyler, making him the earliest former president with living grandchildren. Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. was born in 1924, and Harrison Ruffin Tyler was born in 1928. Lyon Tyler Jr. resides in <a href="Franklin%2C%20Tennessee">Franklin, Tennessee</a>, and Harrison Tyler maintains the family home, <a href="Sherwood%20Forest%20Plantation">Sherwood Forest Plantation</a>, in <a href="Charles%20City%20County%2C%20Virginia">Charles City County, Virginia</a>.

Tyler retired to a Virginia <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a>, originally named Walnut Grove (or "the Grove"), located on the James River in Charles City County. He renamed it <a href="Sherwood%20Forest%20Plantation">Sherwood Forest</a>, in a reference to the folk legend <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>, to signify that he had been "outlawed" by the Whig Party. He did not take farming lightly and worked hard to maintain large yields. His neighbors, largely Whigs, appointed him to the minor office of overseer of roads in 1847 in an effort to mock him. To their displeasure he treated the job seriously, frequently summoning his neighbors to provide their slaves for road work, and continuing to insist on carrying out his duties even after his neighbors asked him to stop.

The former president spent his time in a manner common to <a href="First%20Families%20of%20Virginia">Virginia's First Families</a>, with parties, visiting or being visited by other aristocrats, and spending summers at the family's seaside home, "Villa Margaret". He withdrew from politics, rarely receiving visits from his former allies, and was not sought out as an adviser. Occasionally requested to deliver a public speech, Tyler spoke during the unveiling of a monument to Henry Clay. He acknowledged their political battles, but spoke highly of his former colleague, whom he had always admired for bringing about the Compromise Tariff of 1833.
After <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry</a> ignited fears of an abolitionist attempt to free the slaves, or an actual slave rebellion, several Virginia communities organized militia units, or reenergized existing ones. Tyler's community organized a cavalry troop and a home guard company; Tyler was chosen to command the home guard troops with the rank of captain.

On the eve of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Tyler re-entered public life as presiding officer of the Virginia Peace Conference held in Washington, D.C., in February 1861 as an effort to devise means to prevent a war. The convention sought a compromise to avoid civil war even as the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Constitution">Confederate Constitution</a> was being drawn up at the <a href="Montgomery%20Convention">Montgomery Convention</a>. Despite his leadership role in the Peace Conference, Tyler opposed its final resolutions. He felt that they were written by the free state delegates, did not protect the rights of slave owners in the territories, and would do little to bring back the lower South and restore the Union. He voted against the conference's seven resolutions, which the conference sent to Congress for approval late in February 1861 as a proposed Constitutional amendment.

On the same day the Peace Conference started, local voters elected Tyler to the <a href="Virginia%20Secession%20Convention%20of%201861">Virginia Secession Convention</a>. He presided over the opening session on February 13, 1861, while the Peace Conference was still under way. Tyler abandoned hope of compromise and saw secession as the only option, predicting that a clean split of all Southern states would not result in war. In mid-March he spoke against the Peace Conference resolutions, and on April 4 he voted for secession even when the convention rejected it. On April 17, after the attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call for troops, Tyler voted with the new majority for secession. He headed a committee that negotiated the terms for Virginia's entry into the Confederate States of America and helped set the pay rate for military officers. On June 14, Tyler signed the Ordinance of Secession, and one week later the convention unanimously elected him to the <a href="Provisional%20Confederate%20Congress">Provisional Confederate Congress</a>. Tyler was seated in the Confederate Congress on August 1, 1861, and he served until just before his death in 1862. In November 1861, he was elected to the <a href="Confederate%20House%20of%20Representatives">Confederate House of Representatives</a> but he died of a stroke in his room at the Ballard Hotel in Richmond before the first session could open in February 1862.

Throughout Tyler's life, he suffered from poor health. As he aged, he suffered more frequently from colds during the winter. On January 12, 1862, after complaining of chills and dizziness, he vomited and collapsed. Despite treatment, his health failed to improve, and he made plans to return to Sherwood Forest by the 18th. As he lay in bed the night before, he began suffocating, and Julia summoned his doctor. Just after midnight, Tyler took a sip of <a href="brandy">brandy</a>, and told his doctor, "I am going. Perhaps it is best." He died shortly thereafter, most likely due to a stroke.

Tyler's death was the only one in presidential history not to be officially recognized in Washington, because of his allegiance to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. He had requested a simple burial, but Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> devised a grand, politically pointed funeral, painting Tyler as a hero to the new nation. Accordingly, at his funeral, the coffin of the tenth president of the United States was draped with a <a href="Flags%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate flag</a>; he remains the only U.S. president ever laid to rest under a flag not of the United States.

Tyler was buried in <a href="Hollywood%20Cemetery%20%28Richmond%2C%20Virginia%29">Hollywood Cemetery</a> in Richmond, Virginia, near the gravesite of former President James Monroe. Tyler has since been the namesake of several U.S. locations, including the city of <a href="Tyler%2C%20Texas">Tyler, Texas</a>, named for him because of his role in the annexation of Texas.

Tyler's presidency has provoked highly divided responses among political commentators. It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography "John Tyler, the Accidental President" (2006) by noting: "Other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed." In "The Republican Vision of John Tyler" (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency "is generally ranked as one of the least successful". Seager wrote that Tyler "was neither a great president nor a great intellectual", adding that despite a few achievements, "his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment". A survey of historians conducted by <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> in 2017 ranked Tyler as 39th of 43 men to hold the office.

Tyler's assumption of complete presidential powers "set a hugely important precedent", according to a biographical sketch by the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>'s <a href="Miller%20Center%20of%20Public%20Affairs">Miller Center of Public Affairs</a>. Tyler's successful insistence that he was president, and not a caretaker or acting president, was a model for the succession of seven other presidents over the 19th and 20th centuries. The propriety of Tyler's action in assuming both the title of the presidency and its full powers was legally affirmed in 1967, when it was codified in the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>.

Some scholars in recent years have praised Tyler's foreign policy. Monroe credits him with "achievements like the Webster–Ashburton treaty which heralded the prospect of improved relations with Great Britain, and the annexation of Texas, which added millions of acres to the national domain". Crapol argued that Tyler "was a stronger and more effective president than generally remembered", while Seager wrote, "I find him to be a courageous, principled man, a fair and honest fighter for his beliefs. He was a president without a party." Author <a href="Ivan%20Eland">Ivan Eland</a>, in an update of his 2008 book "Recarving Rushmore", rated all 44 US presidents by the criteria of peace, prosperity, and liberty; with the finished ratings, John Tyler was ranked the best president of all time. Louis Kleber, in his article in "<a href="History%20Today">History Today</a>", pointed out that Tyler brought integrity to the White House at a time when many in politics lacked it, and refused to compromise his principles to avoid the anger of his opponents. Crapol argues that Tyler's allegiance to the Confederacy overshadows much of the good he did as president: "John Tyler's historical reputation has yet to fully recover from that tragic decision to betray his loyalty and commitment to what he had once defined as 'the first great American interest'—the preservation of the Union."

Norma Lois Peterson, in her book on Tyler's presidency, suggested that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever was in the White House. Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize <a href="American%20System%20%28economic%20plan%29">the vision he had for America</a>, and who would brook no opposition. In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of the powers of the Executive Branch, the Whigs wanted the president to be dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate. Tyler resented this, leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency. Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy, she deemed Tyler's presidency "flawed ... but ... not a failure".

While academics have both praised and criticized Tyler, the general American public has little awareness of him at all. Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As Seager remarked: "His countrymen generally remember him, if they have heard of him at all, as the <a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20Too">rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan</a>."
