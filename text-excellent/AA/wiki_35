Death on the Rock

"Death on the Rock" is a controversial television documentary, an episode of <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>'s current affairs series "<a href="This%20Week%20%28ITV%20TV%20series%29">This Week</a>", broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20channel%29">ITV</a> on 28 April 1988. The programme examined the deaths of three <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) members in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (codenamed "<a href="Operation%20Flavius">Operation Flavius</a>"). "Death on the Rock" presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender. It was condemned by the British government, while <a href="tabloid%20journalism">tabloid newspapers</a> denounced it as sensationalist. "Death on the Rock" subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry, in which it was largely vindicated.

The project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb. The series' editor, <a href="Roger%20Bolton%20%28producer%29">Roger Bolton</a>, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Sir%20Geoffrey%20Howe">Sir Geoffrey Howe</a> to have the <a href="Independent%20Broadcasting%20Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a> postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.

The morning after the broadcast, several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and "trial by television". In the following days, they mounted a campaign against <a href="Carmen%20Proetta">Carmen Proetta</a>, one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for <a href="defamation">libel</a>. Other newspapers accused "Death on the Rock" of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for "Death on the Rock" gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness—who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of "Death on the Rock"—the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a "trenchant" work of journalism, made in "good faith and without ulterior motives". Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the <a href="Broadcasting%20Act%201990">Broadcasting Act 1990</a>—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at "Death on the Rock".

"This Week" was a current affairs television series that began in 1956. In 1978, it was renamed "TV Eye" and took on a slightly lighter format; the title "This Week" was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the <a href="ITV%20regions">ITV regions</a> and became a mainstay of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.

On 6 March 1988, three members of an IRA <a href="Active%20Service%20Unit">Active Service Unit</a>—<a href="Daniel%20McCann">Daniel McCann</a>, <a href="Mairead%20Farrell">Mairead Farrell</a>, and <a href="Sean%20Savage">Sean Savage</a>—were witnessed parking a car in a car park in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>; the car park was used as an assembly area for British soldiers preparing for the weekly "changing of the guard" ceremony outside <a href="The%20Convent%20%28Gibraltar%29">the Convent</a> (the residence of the governor of Gibraltar). The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border, they were shot dead by British soldiers, members of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a>. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar, and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the <a href="Gibraltar%20Police">Gibraltar Police</a>. That evening, British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb, and added that the IRA members had been involved in a "shootout" with authorities. All of Britain's daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning, several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as and claimed that it was "packed with shrapnel". The same morning, <a href="Ian%20Stewart%2C%20Baron%20Stewartby">Ian Stewart</a>, <a href="Minister%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Armed%20Forces">Minister of State for the Armed Forces</a>, told <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> that "military personnel were involved" in the shootings, and that "a car bomb was found, which has been defused".

The following day, <a href="Sir%20Geoffrey%20Howe">Sir Geoffrey Howe</a>, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">foreign secretary</a>, made a statement to the House of Commons regarding the shootings, in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed, and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device. Howe stated that the IRA members "made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat". "In light of this response", Howe continued, "they were shot" by "military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police". Subsequent inquiries led to the discovery of a large quantity of explosives in <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a> ( from Gibraltar), along with detonators and timers.

"This Week" editor, <a href="Roger%20Bolton%20%28producer%29">Roger Bolton</a>, initially believed there was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Bolton believed that most people would think the IRA members "deserved what they got". Bolton's interest was piqued by Howe's statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of "This Week"s journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings. Bolton believed that the <a href="Milltown%20Cemetery%20attack">Milltown Cemetery attack</a> and the <a href="corporals%20killings">corporals killings</a>, two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided "even more compelling reasons" to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.

After ten days' investigation, Oxley was surprised to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed "This Week"s investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt to learn more about the surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.

The journalists quickly decided they needed expert advice on ballistics and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel <a href="George%20Styles">George Styles</a>, <a href="George%20Cross">GC</a>, a retired British Army officer who had served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during <a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a>. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault on the day of the shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.

As Styles was examining the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn was approached by an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20Avenue">Winston Churchill Avenue</a> with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed one of the men crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.

By the end of March, Cahn had traced two further witnesses to the shootings—Diana Treacy, who claimed to have seen the soldiers shooting Savage in the back without warning and continuing to shoot him while he was on the ground, and Kenneth Asquez, who had provided a hand-written, unsigned statement, but was extremely reluctant to be filmed or named as a witness. He had come to the attention of the journalists through another witness, who provided Cahn with a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings. The journalists approached the witness through a second intermediary—Christopher Finch, a local lawyer who had been assisting them as a consultant—and received a typed but unsigned affidavit. In both documents, Asquez stated that he had been a passenger in a car that was passing the scene of Savage's shooting on 6 March; he described seeing Savage lying on the ground with a soldier standing over him, and witnessing the soldier shoot Savage "two or three times at point-blank range" while the latter was on the ground. The journalists failed to persuade Asquez to sign his affidavit, but decided to incorporate it into the programme nonetheless.

Julian Manyon arrived in Madrid on 11 March, and shortly afterwards engaged Henry Debelius, a journalist and American expatriate, as an interpreter and consultant for the programme. Within days, the two men wrote to the Spanish police headquarters to request information from the authorities and assistance in reconstructing the surveillance operation that preceded the shootings as the IRA team travelled through Spain. Ten days later, they met with a spokesman for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29">Spanish interior ministry</a>, who confirmed that the Spanish authorities had tracked the three IRA members throughout their time in Spain. The Spanish surveillance operation included multiple cars following the suspects' vehicle, periodically "leap-frogging" each other to avoid attracting attention; use of a helicopter to track the team's movements; constant radio communication between the officers involved and police headquarters; and officers monitoring the suspects' movements at fixed observation posts. The spokesman also told the men that the Spanish kept the British authorities constantly apprised of the IRA team's movements, and that the British were aware of Savage's arrival at the Gibraltar border, and allowed the white Renault he was driving to enter the territory.

As well as the investigation in Gibraltar and Spain, "This Week" conducted some of the filming for "Death on the Rock" in Northern Ireland. Its journalists filmed the funeral of McCann, Savage, and Farrell; while there, Manyon took the opportunity to interview <a href="Gerry%20Adams">Gerry Adams</a>, leader of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, who refused to confirm that the three were planning a bomb attack on Gibraltar. The team decided against using Adams' interview, and only 45 seconds of the footage was used in the final cut. The journalists were keen to show the potential impact of a bomb like the one the IRA had planned to explode in Gibraltar; they initially hoped to film a controlled explosion of a bomb of similar size, but no private contractor would conduct such an experiment without government approval. In lieu of filming an explosion, "This Week" interviewed Noreen Hill—whose husband was left in a coma as a result of a smaller <a href="Remembrance%20Day%20bombing">bombing in Enniskillen</a> in November 1987—to "depict the human tragedy of IRA bombings". They also filmed an interview with a second survivor of the Enniskillen bombing, which was not included in the final cut.

Based on the information his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter, and—with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation—filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.

Throughout the investigation, the authorities in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or to comment on the journalists' findings. Thus, "This Week" were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached <a href="George%20Carman">George Carman</a>—a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues—who agreed to be interviewed for the programme.

On 26 April, two days before "Death on the Rock" was due to air, the British government intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned <a href="George%20Thomson%2C%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Monifieth">Lord Thomson</a>, chair of the <a href="Independent%20Broadcasting%20Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a> (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast on the grounds that Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed "Death on the Rock" before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, "paradoxically", the decision "was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction". With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of "Death on the Rock".

Final editing of the programme was still under way while the IBA was considering Howe's requests, causing Bolton to worry that it would not be completed in time. The editing was eventually finished just ten minutes before the documentary was due to air. "Death on the Rock" was ultimately broadcast in the United Kingdom on schedule, at 21:00 on 28 April 1988, six weeks after the shootings.
The programme opened with excerpts from two of the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from <a href="Jonathan%20Dimbleby">Jonathan Dimbleby</a>, who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was "of critical importance for those who wish to find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month". The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA's bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma as a result of the Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar. Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members' backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation, of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon. The programme reconstructed Savage's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe's statement to the House of Commons: "Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car". Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs.

Manyon continued to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. "Then, suddenly", Manyon told viewers, "shots rang out, and in less than a minute all three terrorists were dead—shot by the SAS". The commentary again cut to Howe's statement, after which Manyon detailed "This Week" investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground. Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up. Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground. Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement—that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground—was read out by an actor.

Styles told Manyon he believed it unlikely that the IRA would have succeeded in detonating a bomb in the assembly area from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot (a distance of approximately ). Returning to Proetta, the documentary heard her reaction to Howe's statement that McCann and Farrell made threatening movements; Proetta believed that the incident was triggered by the siren from the police car on Winston Churchill Avenue. She believed that any movements McCann and Farrell made were in response to the siren, and was adamant that the pair had their hands up when they were shot. Manyon summed up the programme's findings:

Carman, the QC recruited by Bolton, was the last contributor to the documentary. Presented with "This Week" evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish the facts of the incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British <a href="High%20Court%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">High Court</a> judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman "do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?" Carman responded "the programme indicates there are serious, important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated". The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby:

That report was made, as you may have detected, without the cooperation of the British government, which says it will make no comment until the inquest.

As our film contained much new evidence hitherto unavailable to the coroner, we are sending the transcripts to his court in Gibraltar, where it's been made clear to us that all such evidence is welcomed.

From "This Week", goodnight.
The controversy surrounding "Death on the Rock" was "unsurpassed" in Lord Thomson's experience. The morning after the broadcast, the British <a href="Broadsheet%23United%20Kingdom%20broadsheets">broadsheet</a>s appeared open-minded or moderately favourable to "This Week"; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" told readers that "Death on the Rock" "seemed a significant, thoroughly responsible and serious examination of a most disturbing case" and that it "simply raised serious questions and suggested they needed deep examination". The <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29%23Types">tabloids</a>, however, berated the programme and its makers. "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" accused the makers of a "cheap scoop" and labelled the programme "IRA propaganda". The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" was equally robust; its main headline read "fury over SAS 'trial by TV'", while in an inside article, it called the programme "woefully one-sided", and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories. That evening, Bolton agreed to appear on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>'s "<a href="Right%20to%20Reply">Right to Reply</a>", a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes; the programme was pre-recorded, and, unusually, the producers agreed to cut the end of the recording after one of the participants—a former member of Margaret Thatcher's personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer—launched an attack on Bolton, in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists.

Beginning in the days after the broadcast of "Death on the Rock", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">London Evening Standard</a>" printed a story about Proetta's husband; the piece—citing the Gibraltar Police press officer—claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, "The Sun" labelled her "the tart of Gib". Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in <a href="Gibraltar%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%201967">Gibraltar's 1967 referendum</a>. In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued "The Sun" and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.

"<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" attempted to undermine the programme's credibility with its own investigative journalism. Citing "official sources", the paper told its readers that "This Week"s account of the shootings was "crucially flawed", and "bore no resemblance to what happened". It went on to claim that several of the programme's witnesses felt that "Death on the Rock" had misrepresented their statements. It stated that the documentary's technical advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, was aggrieved that two of his "key opinions" had been omitted from the version broadcast—specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects' bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the "This Week" team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil, while the former was included in the broadcast. Josie Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta's account as "ridiculous", while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta's statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car—testimony "The Sunday Times" believed "destroyed" Proetta's evidence. Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers. Through these, it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta's evidence as "ridiculous", while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements. "The Sunday Times" omitted Styles' belief that the shootings were a pre-emptive attack. Styles' view was one of "two active service units waging war [...] taking [the IRA members] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt—that seems to be the only way". Several newspapers were critical of the IBA's decision to allow the documentary to be broadcast.

The witnesses uncovered during the production of "Death on the Rock" appeared at the inquest, which began on 6 September. One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen Feraday, an explosives expert who worked for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD); he confirmed Styles' contribution to the documentary—that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings. Multiple eyewitnesses gave evidence over the course of the inquest. Four gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events; in particular, none saw the soldiers shoot McCann, Savage, or Farrell while they were on the ground. The witnesses from "Death on the Rock" also appeared. Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point-blank range. Josie Celecia's evidence—that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground—was stringently challenged by government lawyers, who pointed out that her account had changed somewhat since she had appeared on camera and that she was unable to identify the SAS soldiers from photographs taken by her husband.

Maxie Proetta appeared on 22 September. He told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car he and his wife had seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to "Death on the Rock" before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after "Death on the Rock" had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after "pestering" from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused "Death on the Rock" of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.

Following the inquest, the families of McCann, Savage, and Farrell applied to the <a href="European%20Commission%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Commission of Human Rights</a> for an opinion on whether the authorities' actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the "right to life") of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR); "This Week" journalists provided statements to the commission regarding the Spanish surveillance operation (the existence of which had been denied by the British authorities at the inquest). The commission's report found no violation of Article 2, but the commission referred the case to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECtHR) for a final decision. The court rejected the families' submission that the British government had conspired to kill the three, but did find a violation of Article 2 in the defective planning and control of the operation. Nevertheless, the applicants' claim for damages was dismissed on the grounds that the trio had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, though it did order the government to pay the applicants' costs.

Following Asquez's retraction of his statement and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; to that end, Thames engaged <a href="David%20Hennessy%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Windlesham">Lord Windlesham</a> and <a href="Richard%20Rampton">Richard Rampton</a>, QC. Windlesham was a Conservative politician, privy councillor, and former minister in the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> and then the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Office">Northern Ireland Office</a>; he also had experience of television journalism, having previously managed two television companies. Rampton was a leading barrister specialising in media law and libel. The inquiry's terms of reference were "to inquire into the making and screening of 'Death on the Rock'", including its creation, production, content, and any effect it had had on the inquest.

The report found that the tendency of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and that it did not explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.

The <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) made representations to the inquiry that "Death on the Rock" could potentially have had an adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast. The first was that the programme might have been seen by members of the inquest jury, and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest. Considering this submission, the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that "Death on the Rock" was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988. The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of "Death on the Rock" from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns, though it was widely discussed in British newspapers (which are widely sold in the territory) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar. The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of "Death on the Rock" would become known in Gibraltar, but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as, in the authors' opinion, the programme raised one possibility, but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events. The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest, as witnesses might have been tempted to give false or embellished accounts for the television. The report dismissed this concern; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw, and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for "Death on the Rock".

Overall, Windlesham and Rampton found "Death on the Rock" to be a "trenchant" work of journalism, made in "good faith and without ulterior motives". In conclusion, the authors believed that "Death on the Rock" proved that "freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication".

The terms of reference of the report did not invite any recommendations, nor did the authors offer any.

"Death on the Rock" was highly praised within the television industry and went on to win the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Documentary">BAFTA Award for Best Documentary</a> and an award from the <a href="Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild">Broadcasting Press Guild</a>. In 2000, "Death on the Rock" was placed 92nd by industry professionals in a list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> compiled by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>.

Two other programmes were made about the Gibraltar shootings for British television, both by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. BBC Northern Ireland produced an episode of "<a href="Spotlight%20%28BBC%20Northern%20Ireland%20TV%20programme%29">Spotlight</a>" which arrived at similar findings to those of "This Week"; Howe attempted to have the programme delayed, using the same rationale with which he requested "Death on the Rock" be postponed. The programme was eventually broadcast, but restricted to Northern Ireland. The BBC's flagship current affairs series "<a href="Panorama%20%28TV%20series%29">Panorama</a>" made a programme about the SAS and its role in the Troubles to coincide with the end of the Gibraltar inquest; it was postponed by BBC executives in the wake of the controversy surrounding "Death on the Rock".

Academic Christian Potschka described "Death on the Rock" as part of a decade of "unprecedented conflict between government and broadcasters over ... investigative documentaries". Margaret Thatcher "utterly rejected" the findings of the Windlesham–Rampton report. After the reforms brought in by the <a href="Broadcasting%20Act%201990">Broadcasting Act 1990</a>, the process of bidding for ITV franchises was overhauled in an attempt to introduce greater competition. In the subsequent auction, Thames Television lost its contract; several journalists and former Thames employees speculated that the Act was the government's revenge for "Death on the Rock". "This Week" ceased after Thames lost its franchise. Lord Thomson, chairman of the IBA, believed the dispute between the government and the authority had a "very substantial influence on Mrs Thatcher's attitude towards broadcasting policy", which led her to the belief that Thames' franchise should not be renewed. The 1990 Act abolished the IBA, which Thomson believed was directly related to the authority's decision to permit the showing of "Death on the Rock".

It was broadcast again in April 1991 as part of the <a href="Channel%204%20Banned%20season">Channel 4 Banned season</a>.

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (), also known by the <a href="initialism">initialism</a> DDLJ, is an Indian <a href="romance%20film">romance film</a>, directed by <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a> (in his directorial debut), produced by his father <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a>, and written by <a href="Javed%20Siddiqui">Javed Siddiqui</a> with Aditya Chopra. Released on 20 October <a href="Bollywood%20films%20of%201995">1995</a>, the film stars <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a>. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">non-resident Indians</a>, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son. The film was shot in India, London and <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, from September 1994 to August 1995.

Earning 1.06 billion (valued at about US$32,766,000 in 1995) in India and 160 million (valued at about US$4,946,000 in 1995) overseas, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" became the highest grossing <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film of the year, and one of the most successful Indian films in history. It won 10 <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, the most for a single film at that time, and won the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Popular%20Film%20Providing%20Wholesome%20Entertainment">National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment</a>. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.

Many critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book "<a href="1001%20Movies%20You%20Must%20See%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</a>", and was placed twelfth on the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of <a href="Indian%20cinema">Indian cinema</a>. As of 2018, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the <a href="Maratha%20Mandir">Maratha Mandir</a> theatre in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.

Raj Malhotra (<a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>) and Simran Singh (<a href="Kajol">Kajol</a>) are non-resident Indians living in <a href="London">London</a>. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh (<a href="Amrish%20Puri">Amrish Puri</a>), while Raj's father Dharamvir Malhotra (<a href="Anupam%20Kher">Anupam Kher</a>) is very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo (<a href="Farida%20Jalal">Farida Jalal</a>) warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit (<a href="Satish%20Shah">Satish Shah</a>), who lives in <a href="Punjab%2C%20India">Punjab</a>, <a href="India">India</a>. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago—to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet (<a href="Parmeet%20Sethi">Parmeet Sethi</a>). Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.

One evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.

On the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a> and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her.

In India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki (<a href="Pooja%20Ruparel">Pooja Ruparel</a>) take an instant dislike to Simran's fiancé Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, his father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeet's families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.

As Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually, Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.

<a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a> assisted his father, director and producer <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a>, during the making of "<a href="Chandni">Chandni</a>" (1989), "<a href="Lamhe">Lamhe</a>" (1991) and "<a href="Darr">Darr</a>" (1993). During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, "<a href="Mohabbatein">Mohabbatein</a>" (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to, and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran's stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer <a href="Pamela%20Chopra">Pamela Chopra</a>, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.

In May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer <a href="Javed%20Siddiqui">Javed Siddiqui</a> and the song lyricist <a href="Anand%20Bakshi">Anand Bakshi</a> to develop words that were "young-sounding". There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela's friend <a href="Honey%20Irani">Honey Irani</a> believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge", neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed.

Aditya originally wanted the film to be about a relationship between an Indian and an American. He wanted <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> for the role of Raj but was dissuaded by Yash, who did not want to use a foreign star. They decided their characters would be non-resident Indians (NRIs). Aditya approached Shah Rukh Khan to play the role of Raj. Shah Rukh was initially not interested because of the romantic nature of the role, having had success playing villainous roles. Aditya then asked <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> to play the lead role because he was having problems persuading Shah Rukh to do it. Saif declined for unknown reasons, as did <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, causing Aditya to continue pursuing Shah Rukh. Aditya and Shah Rukh had four meetings over several weeks; he finally persuaded Shah Rukh by telling him he could never be a superstar unless he became "every woman's dream man, and every mother's dream son". Since then, Shah Rukh has expressed his gratitude to Aditya for helping to make him a star with this film. Shah Rukh said that fellow actor <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> also encouraged him to do the role, saying that he thought the film would be very successful. Shah Rukh has also noted the similarities in the film's script to his own relationship with <a href="Gauri%20Khan">Gauri Khan</a> before their marriage.

Kajol was the first choice to play Simran, to which she quickly agreed; she was a good friend of Aditya. She and Shah Rukh had previously worked together in the successful films "<a href="Baazigar">Baazigar</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Karan%20Arjun">Karan Arjun</a>" (1995). Kajol said her character was very difficult for her to relate to, whereas Shah Rukh said Raj's personality was very similar to his own. Aditya chose the name Raj for the character, and the mandolin that he played, based on his admiration for the actor <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a>. After a successful <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>, Parmeet Sethi was chosen over <a href="Armaan%20Kohli">Armaan Kohli</a> for the role of Kuljeet Singh. In addition to his assistant director <a href="Sameer%20Sharma%20%28director%29">Sameer Sharma</a>, Aditya asked for two additional assistants, his brother <a href="Uday%20Chopra">Uday Chopra</a> and his cousin <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a>. Johar also played a small role in the film as Raj's friend. Sharmishta Roy was the film's art director and <a href="Manish%20Malhotra">Manish Malhotra</a> was its costume designer. While Malhotra had many new ideas, Aditya wanted to keep the clothing style simple; he did not want it to distract from the story. Despite this, Malhotra was responsible for the idea of Simran wearing a green dress in the song "Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna", an unusual colour for a Punjabi bride.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" was filmed in several 5-, 10- and 20-day schedules between September1994 and August1995. The first sequence filmed was for the song "Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko" with Kajol and Shah Rukh in Switzerland. The European journey scenes and songs were mainly filmed in <a href="Saanen">Saanen</a>, <a href="Montbovon">Montbovon</a> and <a href="Gstaad">Gstaad</a>, Switzerland. Other scenes were shot in England, at locations including <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross railway station</a> and <a href="Angel%20tube%20station">Angel Underground station</a>. Film's cinematographer <a href="Manmohan%20Singh%20%28director%29">Manmohan Singh</a>, a regular collaborator with Chopra, shot the song "Tujhe Dekha To", including the iconic mustard fields scenes with Shah Rukh and Kajol in the mustard fields in <a href="Gurgaon">Gurgaon</a> on the outskirts of the <a href="National%20Capital%20Region%20%28India%29">National Capital Region Delhi</a>.
The cast faced difficulties while filming the final scene, which shows Simran running to catch the train on which Raj is travelling. The smoldering heat made it difficult to shoot and each time there was a retake, the train took 20 minutes to return.

<a href="Saroj%20Khan">Saroj Khan</a> was the choreographer throughout most of the production, but after several disputes between her and Aditya, she was replaced by <a href="Farah%20Khan">Farah Khan</a> near the end of the shoot. After the film's eventual success, Saroj apologised to Aditya for underestimating him, but she never worked with him again. Farah choreographed the song "Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane", during which Aditya did not tell Kajol that Shah Rukh was going to drop her, as he wanted to capture her genuine reaction. The film's title was suggested by actress <a href="Kirron%20Kher">Kirron Kher</a>; it came from the song "Le Jayenge Le Jayenge", in the film "<a href="Chor%20Machaye%20Shor">Chor Machaye Shor</a>" (1974). The Raj character sings parts of this song during the story, and it recurs at the end. "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" is believed to be the only Bollywood film with a "Title suggested by" credit. The film has since become universally known by the acronym "DDLJ".

Towards the end of the <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a>, Shah Rukh had to split his time between this film and "<a href="Trimurti%20%28film%29">Trimurti</a>" (1995), spending half of his day on each film. In early August1995, when filming on "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" was not yet finished, a release date in October around the time of the <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a> festival was decided upon. Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September. After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making" was broadcast on television by <a href="Doordarshan">Doordarshan</a>.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence. To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's "good guy", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners. Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.

The story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism. Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires. The film implies that "Indianness" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.

In "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge", the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: "You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's "izzat" (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night." This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system, and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity. In "The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films", Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.

Scott Jordan Harris, writing for <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, "It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will". Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage. According to Patricia Uberoi, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" reiterates the theme of "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun..%21">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a>" (1994) in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.

The "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" soundtrack features seven songs composed by <a href="Jatin%20Lalit">Jatin Lalit</a>, a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit. Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics and <a href="Lata%20Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>, <a href="Asha%20Bhosle">Asha Bhosle</a>, <a href="Kumar%20Sanu">Kumar Sanu</a>, <a href="Abhijeet%20Bhattacharya">Abhijeet Bhattacharya</a> and <a href="Udit%20Narayan">Udit Narayan</a> performed the vocals. Jatin Lalit was considered for the job when singer Asha Bhosle contacted Yash Chopra after meeting the duo. It was their first collaboration with Yash Raj Films. They secured the job after singing "Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna" for Yash. In return, they ensured she sang one song, "Zara Sa Jhoom Loon Main". Pamela Chopra helped them select tunes and instruments to give some of the songs a Punjabi flavour. Bhasker Gupta, writing for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, said the soundtrack was the best of Jatin Lalit's career, and that it "marked the beginning of the fifth wave in Indian cinema ...". 

The soundtrack became the best-selling <a href="Music%20of%20Bollywood">Bollywood soundtrack</a> of the year, with 12 million official units sold by <a href="HMV">HMV</a>, although it is estimated the same number or more copies were pirated. More than 1 million of those sales occurred prior to the film's release, with Chopra earning an advance of for the music rights. <a href="Gulshan%20Kumar">Gulshan Kumar</a> sold an unofficial version of the soundtrack under his <a href="T-Series%20%28company%29">T-Series</a> label. Combined sales of both the official HMV version and the unofficial T-Series version amounted to 20million copies. The total number of estimated sales including pirated copies range from 25million to over 100million.

In 2005, the album was judged the top Hindi soundtrack of all time by voters on the <a href="BBC%20Asian%20Network">BBC Asian Network</a> website. Anand Bakshi won his third Filmfare Best Lyricist award after 14 years, having two nominations for this film. The wedding song "Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna" from the film became an all-time hit; it is played at weddings across the South Asian diaspora. The following is the track listing.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" opened on 20 October 1995 to sold-out shows worldwide. Every show in every theatre in Mumbai—save one—was completely full for the first week. The film was popular among both resident Indians and NRIs. At San Francisco's 720-seat Naz theatre, 1,000 people arrived for the first showing, and the theatre staff were forced to run another show late that night. In the UK, the film ran for over a year, and as of 2017, the <a href="Maratha%20Mandir">Maratha Mandir</a> cinema hall in Mumbai has been showing it for more than 22 years.

The film earned 1.06 billion (valued at about US$32,766,000 in 1995) in India and 160 million (valued at about US$4,946,000 in 1995) overseas; it became the biggest Bollywood grosser of the year, and the second highest-grossing film of the 1990s behind "Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!". It was the second Indian film to gross over 1 billion worldwide, and one of the biggest Bollywood earners of all time. Adjusted for inflation, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" is among the highest-grossing Hindi films ever; its domestic <a href="net%20income">net income</a> (533 million at the time) is approximately () when adjusted for inflation. As of 2009, the film had generated over in revenues for the Maratha Mandir since its release. In later years, that theatre ran one matinee show per day at reduced ticket prices, which averaged about 50% occupancy.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" received many favourable reviews. An initial review by weekly magazine "<a href="Screen%20%28magazine%29">Screen</a>" said of Aditya Chopra, "A young master arrives". Tom Vick, reviewing the film for <a href="Allmovie">Allmovie</a>, said, "An immensely likeable movie, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" performs the rarely achieved feat of stretching a predictable plot over three hours and making every minute enjoyable." When the film toured the US in 2004 as part of the Cinema India showcase, "The Changing Face of Indian Cinema", Charles Taylor reviewed the film for "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" and said, "It's a flawed, contradictory movie—aggressive and tender, stiff and graceful, clichéd and fresh, sophisticated and naive, traditional and modern. It's also, I think, a classic."

Writing for <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a>, <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> said, "Perhaps the innocence of Raj and Simran's romance in which they can spend the night together without sex because Raj, the bratish NRI understands the importance of an Indian woman's honor. Perhaps it's the way in which the film artfully reaffirms the patriarchal status quo and works for all constituencies—the NRI and the local viewer. Or perhaps it's the magic of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol who created a template for modern love, which was hip and cool but resolutely Indian." She also called the film a milestone that shaped Hindi cinema through the 1990s, and one of her personal favourites. In 2004, Meor Shariman of "<a href="The%20Malay%20Mail">The Malay Mail</a>" called the film a "must watch" for Bollywood fans, and also for those seeking an introduction to Bollywood.

<a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> gave a reflective review for <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> in 2005, calling the film one of the best Hindi films made in the previous 20 years. He said "Shah Rukh Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the Lover for the 1990s with great panache", and called Kajol a "real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity" to her role. Sen called the film well balanced and said only the fight scene and some mother-daughter dialogue can wear after multiple viewings. Omer M. Mozaffar, writing for <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s website in 2012, likened the film to a <a href="Disney%20Princess">Disney Princess</a> story, saying, "the young princess feeling trapped by the traditional patriarchy, seeking freedom through discovering the world, but finally finding it through silent, but inappropriate love. The Little Mermaid. Beauty (of the Beast). Jasmine (friends with Aladdin). Pocahontas. Aurora (Sleeping Beauty). And here, Simran." Scott Jordan Harris, also writing for Roger Ebert in 2014, called it "one of the world's favorite films", and said it plays as a masterful soap opera, with one of the best screen couples ever seen. <a href="Sogosurvey">Sogosurvey</a> conducted an online survey in 2016 in which approximately 47% of the people who participated voted "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" as Bollywood's most evergreen love story.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" was ranked among "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>"'s list of the "10 Bollywood movies you must see before you die". It was one of three Hindi films in the film reference book "<a href="1001%20Movies%20You%20Must%20See%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</a>", the others being "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Deewaar">Deewaar</a>" (1975). It was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. It is one of the films on Box Office India's list of "Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema". The film won a <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Award</a> and 10 <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, setting the record at the time for the most Filmfare trophies.

In 2001, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" overtook "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>" (1975), which had run for over five years at the Minerva theatre, as the longest-running film in Indian cinema history. It has been showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre (which was famous for having shown "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960) for three years) since its original release in 1995. There are often people in the audience who have seen the film 50 or more times, but still clap, cheer, mouth the dialogues and sing along with the songs, raising comparisons with "<a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>" (1975), the longest running film in America.

When a theatre strike in early 2011 threatened the film's uninterrupted run, the producer Yash Chopra contacted theatre owners to try and ensure the film would continue. He hoped the film would continue to run for at least 1,000 weeks, which it achieved in December2014. To commemorate the event, cast members including Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal, Mandira Bedi and Pooja Ruparel appeared on the television show "<a href="Comedy%20Nights%20with%20Kapil">Comedy Nights with Kapil</a>". Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and director Aditya Chopra also attended a live chat with fans and a black tie event at the theatre on 12 December. The same day, they launched a coffee table book written by Aditya Chopra about the making of the film. Also in December, Yash Raj Films announced the availability of a collection of commemorative, licensed merchandise from various suppliers to mark the event. The Maratha Mandir's management ended the film's run after 1,009 weeks on 19 February2015 because of low attendance (the last show was viewed by 210 people). However, after an outpouring of support from fans, and talks with the production company, they decided to reinstate the film.

"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" spawned many imitators of its story and style, especially throughout the 1990s. According to the "Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema", it and a handful of other films and young directors started a trend for "designer" films. The authors said that these were "a carefully packaged and branded product in which every little visual and physical detail ... is of utmost importance". In "Bollywood's Top 20: Superstars of Indian Cinema", <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> said "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" "reinvented Bollywood romances so decisively that we can neatly divide them into two eras—before "DDLJ" and after "DDLJ"".

Yash Raj Films was previously known for using locations outside India for <a href="item%20number">item number</a>s in its films. "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" started the trend for films designed to appeal to the Indian diaspora, which have foreign locations as integral parts of the story. The characters are themselves diaspora and tend to be able to move with ease between India and the West. Some later films that followed this trend include "<a href="Pardes%20%28film%29">Pardes</a>" (1997), "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (2001), "<a href="Kal%20Ho%20Naa%20Ho">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a>" (2003), "<a href="Salaam%20Namaste">Salaam Namaste</a>" (2005), "<a href="Neal%20%27n%27%20Nikki">Neal 'n' Nikki</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006). "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" became the first Hindi film blockbuster to feature NRIs as main characters. It helped to establish the diaspora market as a vital source of revenue for the industry; that market was seen as a safer financial investment than the <a href="desi">desi</a> market.

Several later films have paid homage to "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge". The Karan Johar-produced "<a href="Humpty%20Sharma%20Ki%20Dulhania">Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania</a>" (2014) was directly inspired by it. The films "<a href="Jab%20We%20Met">Jab We Met</a>" (2007), "<a href="Bodyguard%20%282011%20Hindi%20film%29">Bodyguard</a>" (2011), "<a href="Chalo%20Dilli">Chalo Dilli</a>" (2011), "<a href="Yeh%20Jawaani%20Hai%20Deewani">Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</a>" (2013) and "<a href="Chennai%20Express">Chennai Express</a>" (2013) include scenes similar to the climactic train sequence, wherein a woman is running to catch a moving train and is helped aboard by a man with his outstretched arm. The British film "<a href="Slumdog%20Millionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a>" (2008) contained a similar train scene, and its final dance sequence was partially shot at the same railway station as the "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" finale.

Audiences appreciated the screen chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who later worked together in several successful films including "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>" (1998), "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (2001), "<a href="My%20Name%20Is%20Khan">My Name Is Khan</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Dilwale%20%282015%20film%29">Dilwale</a>" (2015), and are often referred to as Indian cinema's most loved on-screen couple. Shah Rukh Khan credits this film with making him a star, and says it "changed the entire scene for romantic movies of the 90s". During an interview in 2002, he said "Whatever I'll stand for as an actor, in the whole of my career, whenever it ends, it will start with and end at "Dilwale"". The actress Farida Jalal said the film gave her career a boost, saying she got many offers and "could quote any price". It also helped the young careers of Pooja Ruparel, who received advertising offers, and of Sharmistha Roy.

The British Film Institute (BFI) commissioned a book about "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge". It was the first Hindi film chosen for a series of studies on international films, called "BFI Modern Classics". The author was Anupama Chopra and the book was released in 2002. It was reissued in paperback by Harper-Collins as "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: The Making of a Blockbuster" in 2004. After an unexpectedly long delay, the film was released on DVD by Yash Raj Films in 2002. The release included "The Making" and "300 Weeks Celebration" documentaries, "Success Story" (highlights from the film's premiere), clips from the <a href="41st%20Filmfare%20Awards">41st Filmfare Awards</a> ceremony and other interviews.

In 2006, members of the film crew were honoured at a dinner event to celebrate the film's 500th week since release. It was hosted by the Consulate General of Switzerland in Mumbai and by Switzerland Tourism. In 2010, Yash Raj Films signed an agreement with Indian and Swiss tour companies to provide a tour package called "YRF Enchanted Journey", to allow visitors to Switzerland to view filming locations used for famous Yash Raj films including "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge". In 2014, Yash Raj Films released "Aditya Chopra Relives ... Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (As Told to Nasreen Munni Kabir)", an attractive but expensive book about the making of the film. In response to Indian prime minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a> quoting the line "May the force be with you" from the American film franchise "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" during a visit to the US, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> decided to quote a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India in January2015. He chose a line from this film, ""Senorita, bade bade deshon mein ..."" (Miss, in large countries ...), and added "you know what I mean".

Sasha (DJ)

Alexander Paul Coe (born 4 September 1969), known <a href="mononymously">mononymously</a> as Sasha, is a Welsh DJ and record producer. He is best known for his live events and <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> as a solo artist, as well as his collaborations with British DJ <a href="John%20Digweed">John Digweed</a> as <a href="Sasha%20%26amp%3B%20John%20Digweed">Sasha & John Digweed</a>. He was voted World No.⁠ ⁠1 DJ in 2000 in a poll conducted by <a href="DJ%20Magazine">DJ Magazine</a>. He is a four-time <a href="International%20Dance%20Music%20Awards">International Dance Music Awards</a> winner, four-time <a href="List%20of%20DJ%20Awards%20winners%20and%20nominees">DJ Awards</a> winner and <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Award</a> nominee.

Sasha began his career playing <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> dance music in the late 1980s. He partnered with <a href="John%20Digweed">John Digweed</a> in 1993, touring internationally and producing a series of <a href="mix%20album">mix album</a>s (compilations of other artists' work played in a continuous fashion).

Sasha has <a href="remix">remix</a>ed tracks for artists such as <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="The%20Chemical%20Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href="Hot%20Chip">Hot Chip</a>. Sasha's remixing and production often combine electronic music genres, making it difficult for critics to pinpoint his musical style. As well as remixes and compilation albums, Sasha has produced three albums of original works: "<a href="The%20Qat%20Collection">The Qat Collection</a>" in 1994, "<a href="Airdrawndagger">Airdrawndagger</a>" in 2002, and "<a href="Scene%20Delete">Scene Delete</a>" in 2016.

After achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as <a href="BT%20%28musician%29">BT</a> and James Zabiela. His use of live <a href="audio%20engineering">audio engineering</a> equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on <a href="gramophone%20record">records</a> and <a href="phonograph">turntables</a>. In 2007, he formed a record label with <a href="Renaissance%20Records">Renaissance Records</a> called <a href="emFire">emFire</a>, which is the exclusive outlet for his new music. Sasha is managed by Three Six Zero Group.

Sasha was born in <a href="Bangor%2C%20Wales">Bangor, Wales</a> on 4 September 1969, but spent most of his youth with his mother in the Welsh town of Sandycroft, <a href="Flintshire">Flintshire</a>, <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>. Sasha's mother taught French at Hawarden High School. Sasha's early musical taste was primarily <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> pop music like <a href="The%20The">The The</a> and <a href="The%20Police">The Police</a>. After an "idyllic childhood", he passed the entrance exam for Hatfield College at age 17. However, he did not like Epsom and left before completing his <a href="Advanced%20Level%20%28UK%29">A-Level</a> examinations. Instead of continuing his schooling, Sasha moved to Bangor to live with his father and stepmother. Sasha's stepmother forced him to take piano lessons which, although he disliked them at the time, Sasha ultimately found to be beneficial to his music career.

Sasha became aware of electronic dance music in 1988 at <a href="The%20Ha%C3%A7ienda">The Haçienda</a>, a <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> dance venue. Drawn to the rough sound of <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby <a href="Disley">Disley</a>. Sasha purchased many jazz records and began to teach himself how to <a href="DJ%20mix">mix</a>. A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented announced that he was looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour. Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a>. Sasha recalled of his debut, "I'd never even touched a <a href="Technics%20%28brand%29">Technics</a>: I thought the <a href="pitch%20control">pitch control</a> was the volume, I didn't even know where to plug my headphones in! I'm sure I was absolutely horrendous."

Sasha soon found himself in debt due to low-paying performances and the many records he bought. To finance his record collection, he performed at illegal warehouse <a href="rave">rave</a>s in the <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> and <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> areas. With the assistance of another local DJ, <a href="Jon%20DaSilva">Jon DaSilva</a>, Sasha secured work at The Haçienda, where he learned <a href="key%20mixing">key mixing</a> (matching melodic keys) from DaSilva and refined his ability to <a href="beatmatch">beatmatch</a> (to synchronize the beats of two simultaneously playing records). Though he enjoyed playing at The Haçienda, in 1990 Sasha left for a club called <a href="Shelley%27s%20Laserdrome">Shelley's Laserdrome</a> in <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a>. There, he established part of his signature sound by mixing euphoric acid house music with Italian piano house and emotional <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>s. Because of his increased popularity and visibility at Shelley's and the fact the promoter worked for the magazine, "<a href="Mixmag">Mixmag</a>" featured Sasha on its first cover, under the headline "SASHA MANIA - THE FIRST DJ PINUP?". While continuing to DJ, Sasha began to produce several of his own dance tracks. This, he later noted, was contrary to the career paths of many successful DJs, for whom it was more common to start out as producers. Upon signing a <a href="recording%20contract">recording contract</a>, he also set up an entire <a href="recording%20studio">recording studio</a> at the same time, which led to a "painful learning curve" at the outset. Sasha's first production/remix credits were two singles for Evolution: 1990's "Came Outa Nowhere (Take Me Higher Mix)" and 1991's "Metropolis", for which he produced and remixed both sides of the classic house track; the record is most notable for the "Can't Stand The Feeling Mix", where Sasha replicated his signature mixing style of putting an a cappella vocal over the top of the main track, namely the vocal from The Jason Load Experience's single "Mainline '90", which was released in 1989. He released his first single, "Appolonia", under the name "BM:Ex" (the name is short for The Barry Manilow Experience, a joke in reference to Sasha's love of the piano), with producer <a href="Tom%20Frederikse">Tom Frederikse</a> on <a href="Union%20City%20Recordings">Union City Recordings</a>. After DJing at Shelley's for several years, Sasha left his position because of increasing gang violence in and around the club. As a result of his growing reputation, Sasha was offered work in several <a href="London">London</a> and Australian clubs. He accepted, instead, a spot in the DJ rotation at <a href="Renaissance%20%28club%29">Renaissance</a> a club night started by Geoff Oakes at Venue 44 in Mansfield, England.

Later in 1993, Sasha produced "Together", his first single under the name "Sasha". "Together", which he produced with Danny Campbell for <a href="Pete%20Tong">Pete Tong</a>'s <a href="FFRR">FFRR</a>, peaked on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> at #57. With this success, Sasha began a series of records for <a href="Deconstruction%20Records">Deconstruction Records</a> with the singles "Higher Ground" and "Magic" (for which Digweed produced a remix) and "<a href="The%20Qat%20Collection">The Qat Collection</a>" with Frederikse and vocalist <a href="Sam%20Mollison">Sam Mollison</a>.

In early 1993, Sasha partnered with fellow <a href="Renaissance%20Recordings">Renaissance</a> DJ <a href="John%20Digweed">John Digweed</a>. Sasha and Digweed honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances, and had the duo compile the triple-CD <a href="mix%20album">mix album</a> "<a href="Renaissance%20-%20The%20Mix%20Collection">Renaissance - The Mix Collection</a>", releasing it on the club's own <a href="Renaissance%20Records">Renaissance Records</a> label. The album featured tracks from such artists as <a href="Leftfield">Leftfield</a>, <a href="Fluke%20%28band%29">Fluke</a>, and <a href="2%20Bad%20Mice">2 Bad Mice</a>, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed. "The Mix Collection" was released soon after Sasha's departure from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his success at Renaissance, Sasha was again featured on "Mixmag" with the <a href="tagline">tagline</a> "SON OF GOD?", though he resented the accolade. After touring together for two years, the duo became "true superstars" with the release of their double CD "<a href="Northern%20Exposure%20%28album%29">Northern Exposure</a>" on mega-label <a href="Ministry%20of%20Sound">Ministry of Sound</a>. Around this time, Sasha began a recurring mentorship and partnership with fellow producer <a href="BT%20%28musician%29">BT</a> with the album "<a href="Ima%20%28BT%20album%29">Ima</a>". As well as providing guidance for BT, Sasha produced a "euphoric" and "introspective" 42-minute rendition of the album which formed the centrepiece of the UK release and appeared as a "bonus" second disc on the US release. He continued to advance his own production work by pairing with vocalist <a href="Maria%20Nayler">Maria Nayler</a> to produce the single "Be as One", which reached #17 on the UK singles chart.

In 1997, Ministry of Sound released "<a href="Northern%20Exposure%202">Northern Exposure 2</a>", Sasha and Digweed's next double-CD entry in their Northern Exposure series. To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s. After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s famous <a href="Twilo">Twilo</a> nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night. In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the <a href="Global%20Underground">Global Underground</a> series: Digweed's "", and Sasha's "", which drew from his experience touring on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a>. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started <a href="Bedrock%20Records">Bedrock Records</a>. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency Excession: The Agency LTD. Excession remains a <a href="booking%20agency">booking agency</a> for many DJs, including <a href="Hybrid%20%28British%20band%29">Hybrid</a>, <a href="Nick%20Warren">Nick Warren</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Lawler">Steve Lawler</a>.

Sasha reached a more mainstream audience with his remixes of <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>'s "<a href="Ray%20of%20Light%20%28song%29">Ray of Light</a>" and <a href="GusGus">GusGus</a>'s "Purple" for those artists' single releases. His success in pop music led him to <a href="Film%20score">score</a> the music for the <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s "<a href="Wipeout%203">Wipeout 3</a>" and "<a href="Gran%20Turismo%20%28video%20game%29">Gran Turismo</a>". In 1999, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third edition in the Northern Exposure series, "". In addition to mixing and DJing, Sasha joined <a href="Charlie%20May%20%28producer%29">Charlie May</a> of <a href="Spooky%20%28house%20music%20duo%29">Spooky</a> to produce the "<a href="Xpander%20EP">Xpander EP</a>", the title track of which many clubbers still view as "one of the greatest trance tracks of all time". He used the title track as a centerpiece for "", his second Global Underground release. Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track "Ride", which was released as a single on <a href="Yoshitoshi%20Records">Yoshitoshi Records</a> and on BT's "<a href="Movement%20in%20Still%20Life">Movement in Still Life</a>". Soon after, he worked with <a href="Underworld%20%28band%29">Underworld</a>'s <a href="Darren%20Emerson">Darren Emerson</a> on the single "<a href="Scorchio%20%28instrumental%29">Scorchio</a>", Sasha's first charting single in four years. In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album "<a href="Communicate%20%28mix%20album%29">Communicate</a>" in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. "Communicate" had mixed reviews: "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" stated that despite a "few stellar moments, ["Communicate"] is ultimately a let-down". <a href="LAUNCHcast">LAUNCHcast</a>, too, described "Communicate" as "boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats".

During the late 1990s, the increased popularity and visibility of "superstar DJs" led to the creation of <a href="superclub">superclub</a>s such as Liverpool's <a href="Cream%20%28nightclub%29">Cream</a> and Sheffield's <a href="Gatecrasher">Gatecrasher</a>. By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"'s pop critic, Alexis Petridis, attributed the "terminal decline" of dance music to its over-commercialisation by big-name DJs, such as Sasha, and to their demands for increased fees for performances. Though dance music had been declared "dead" by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour—despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club Twilo in May 2001.

After the closing of Twilo, Sasha and Digweed embarked on their ambitious Delta Heavy Tour of the United States in 2002. Featuring veteran tour producer <a href="Kevin%20Lyman">Kevin Lyman</a> and opening act <a href="Jimmy%20Van%20M">Jimmy Van M</a>, the tour covered 31 cities and played to 85,000 people. The appearances, complete with <a href="laser%20show">laser show</a>s and video production, were more akin to rock concerts than to typical DJ events. This development was new to the DJing scene, and compelled other DJs to host similar concerts. A DVD of performance highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage was released as "<a href="Sasha%20%26amp%3B%20John%20Digweed%20present%20Delta%20Heavy">Sasha & John Digweed present Delta Heavy</a>" by <a href="System%20Recordings">System Recordings</a>. Ben Turner, creator of the DanceStar awards, retrospectively described the Delta Heavy tour as "a landmark moment for electronic music". Though the duo of Sasha and Digweed never explicitly split up, demanding schedules and frequent independent touring prevented any substantial collaboration for a long period after Delta Heavy.

During the latter half of 2002, Sasha collaborated with <a href="big%20beat">big beat</a> artist <a href="Junkie%20XL">Junkie XL</a> on the single "Breezer". Junkie XL, along with Charlie May, also assisted Sasha on his second album of original material, "<a href="Airdrawndagger">Airdrawndagger</a>". "Airdrawndagger" took several years to produce due to Sasha's desire for the album to be "as near to perfection as possible." That March, Sasha suffered a <a href="perforated%20eardrum">perforated eardrum</a> in a traffic accident, further delaying the album's production. Though the accident temporarily impaired his hearing, he drew inspiration for the album from his ordeal. "Airdrawndagger" was finally released, in August 2002, to much fanfare. However, the album was "received with a lot of head scratching", according to Sasha, which he attributed to its unexpected mix of genres. The album did not feature the heavier "club sound" of Sasha's previous mix albums, bearing a closer resemblance to <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a>. "Airdrawndagger" generally received favorable reviews, though critics noted that it was not as consistent and well produced as his DJ mixes. Sasha himself described it as "a selfish, slightly self-indulgent record", though he maintains that he is "happy with it to this day". Some critics, however, called it "sleepy"; "<a href="E%21Online">E!Online</a>" described it as being "more in league with <a href="Yanni">Yanni</a> than <a href="Moby">Moby</a>". To encourage listeners' interest, Sasha held an amateur remix contest for the album's single, "<a href="Wavy%20Gravy%20%28instrumental%29">Wavy Gravy</a>". Due to the contest's success, Sasha released all the tracks from "Airdrawndagger" on his website, so that fans could download and create their own versions.

After the release of "Airdrawndagger", Sasha took the young DJ James Zabiela "under his wing". He introduced Zabiela to the <a href="CDJ1000">CDJ1000</a> turntable, and signed Zabiela to the Excession talent agency. The two toured the United States together, which extended Sasha's influence to already-popular American DJs such as Kimball Collins.
In 2004, Sasha signed with <a href="Global%20Underground">Global Underground</a> to produce another mix album. However, he found the process of creating a standard mix album unrewarding, and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a "real" album—that is, one featuring original material. Sasha's next studio album, "<a href="Involver">Involver</a>", was "a fusion of mix album and ", consisting entirely of Sasha's reworkings of tracks by other artists. "I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [and recombine them]", he later explained, "and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level." He accomplished this by <a href="Music%20sequencer">sequencing</a> the album using <a href="Ableton%20Live">Ableton Live</a> and <a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic Pro</a>. Ableton Live is a <a href="music%20loop">music loop</a>-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.

In 2005, Sasha produced his next mix album, "<a href="Fundacion%20NYC">Fundacion NYC</a>", based on his nights DJing in New York at the Crobar club. "Fundacion NYC" received positive reviews for its originality, though "JIVE Magazine" found it "too complicated for the ear". Sasha is pleased with the album, and plans to make a series of Fundacion albums. The next year, Sasha released 10,000 copies of a June 2006 DJ set for sale using <a href="Instant%20Live">Instant Live</a>, making him the first DJ to use Instant Live's licensing and publishing services. In August 2007, Sasha announced the formation of his record label, Emfire, which will be the exclusive outlet for his new material in both vinyl and digital formats. Its first release was "COMA", a collaborative track by a group of the same name, which features Sasha, Barry Jamieson, Charlie May, and Duncan Forbes. While continuing to regularly DJ, Sasha began work on another "Involver" mix and the next "Fundacion" mix. Sasha's "<a href="Invol2ver">Invol2ver</a>" was released in September 2008, and "Invol<3r" was released in March 2013.

Though frequent performing kept them apart for several years, Sasha and Digweed announced that they would reunite for a few Australian performances. In November 2006, the duo performed at several venues, including <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> as well as numerous tour dates throughout 2007. In 2008, Sasha and Digweed kicked off an American tour with a performance at the <a href="Winter%20Music%20Conference">Winter Music Conference</a>. The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays. Sasha described their music as "driving and dark" with "a little throwback of Twilo sounds".

Sasha runs a music studio and lives in New York City, and maintains a house in London. He brings his wife with him on his frequent tours. Sasha finds the constant touring to be physically tiring, though he also feels that he thrives on it. While fans may regard Sasha to be a DJ "hero", he is uneasy with fame; Sasha considers himself "shy at heart" and is typically uncomfortable discussing his personal life. He has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is so busy with DJing and production that he rarely has any free time. However, he enjoys watching <a href="Football%20%28soccer%29">football</a>, cooking, and sampling the cuisine of the countries he visits.
The movie "New Emissions of Light & Sound" won the Best Original Score at the X-Dance Film Festival. The score was made up of new and previously unreleased tracks.

Sasha and Digweed have re-united again in recent years. The iconic duo Sasha & John Digweed performed a Back to Back set at the Ministry of Sound in London on 24 March 2016. Shortly there after, the Duo announced a list of tour dates for <a href="https%3A//www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7318924/sasha-john-digweed-reunion-tour-dance">September</a> 2016 to re-launch themselves in a series of Gigs and performing Back to Back.

Influenced by the early sound of The Haçienda, Sasha began his career playing records of the rough, danceable genre of acid house. By the early 1990s, he had moved towards a more dark European <a href="house%20music">house music</a> style, though by the time of his Shelley's residency he had begun to experiment more with American house. His tastes further developed as he moved to Renaissance, and he began to incorporate the pop-based sounds of <a href="Moby">Moby</a>, <a href="Spooky%20%28house%20music%20duo%29">Spooky</a>, and <a href="Leftfield">Leftfield</a>. Sasha's second Digweed collaboration, 1997's "Northern Exposure", was described as "epic house", and subsequent releases featured the spacey and atmospheric trance house sound of artists such as <a href="Sven%20V%C3%A4th">Sven Väth</a>, <a href="Matt%20Darey">Matt Darey</a>, <a href="Tilt%20%28producers%29">Tilt</a>, and <a href="Armin%20Van%20Buuren">Armin Van Buuren</a>. A rhythmic and bassy <a href="progressive%20house">progressive house</a> influence distinguished his "Xpander EP" and the mix albums of the late 1990s. At the time, Sasha's music rotation included records by artists such as <a href="Space%20Manoeuvres">Space Manoeuvres</a>, <a href="BT%20%28musician%29">BT</a>, and Breeder, and <a href="Sander%20Kleinenberg">Sander Kleinenberg</a>'s single "My Lexicon".

With the 2000 album "Communicate", the duo's work moved towards a deeper and darker house music sound. The album featured tracks by <a href="Richard%20Morel">Morel</a>, <a href="James%20Holden%20%28producer%29">Mainline</a>, and <a href="Jimmy%20Van%20M">Jimmy Van M</a>. The focus shifted from the melodic themes of previous releases in favour of a stronger emphasis on the bassline. The Delta Heavy Tour and "<a href="Airdrawndagger">Airdrawndagger</a>" marked a dramatic shift in style, and reflected the influences of relaxed <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> and <a href="breakbeat">breakbeat</a> music on Sasha's work. These influences inspired the album's strong melodies, occasional breakbeat loops, and limited use of percussion. "Involver" was primarily a fusion of the musical style of house and ambient breakbeat music characterised by <a href="UNKLE">UNKLE</a> and <a href="Lostep">Lostep</a>. With 2005's "Fundacion", Sasha's style was mostly progressive house and <a href="electro%20house">electro house</a> music, with work by <a href="James%20Holden%20%28producer%29">James Holden</a>, <a href="Tiefschwarz">Tiefschwarz</a>, and <a href="Swayzak">Swayzak</a>. With his success in progressive house, Sasha has commented that he feels people try to "pigeon-hole" him into playing that genre. Rather than calling it progressive house, Sasha considers his most recent material to be between house, trance, and breaks, though he has stated that he prefers not to associate himself with a specific genre of music.

Sasha attributes his success to his technical skill and ability to "connect with his dancers". During performances, he balances new and experimental material, while ensuring that "the party is still rockin'". His spontaneity carries over to studio work; he typically has only a vague idea of the track listing when beginning work on a new mix album. Because of this, his albums never turn out quite as he expects.
Sasha is known for applying new music technologies to both his studio and live work. Both Sasha and Digweed used <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> on <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers when mixing their compilation albums, and used turntables and records during live performances. For their remixes, however, they used an <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>—an obsolete <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> from the early 1990s—with <a href="Notator">Notator</a>, a <a href="music%20sequencer">music sequencer</a> used for arranging audio tracks. For more recent albums such as "Fundacion NYC", Sasha used Ableton Live for sequencing, partially because of Pro Tools' higher price. In live performances up to the late 1990s, Sasha performed exclusively using records. Before he started using the <a href="CDJ1000">CDJ1000</a>, a "turntable" used for CDs, he had his digital music specially cut to <a href="acetate%20disc">acetate records</a> before each tour. Once he integrated CDs into his live act, Sasha operated CDJ1000s with <a href="Allen%20%26amp%3B%20Heath">Allen & Heath</a> mixers and <a href="FireworX">FireworX</a>.
Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, using it in tandem with turntables. Having explored its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live. He then co-developed the Maven <a href="MIDI%20controller">controller</a>, which he uses as a physical interface to the Live software. (DJing with a <a href="mouse%20%28computing%29">mouse</a> alone, he has said, is "not going to look right or feel right".) "Fundacion NYC" was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller. During DJ sets, clubbers often believe Sasha is playing new, unheard remixes; in fact, he is often playing modifications of tracks created in Ableton. Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plugins</a>, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins. For the first public performance of "Involver" material, he used a <a href="PowerBook">PowerBook</a> running Ableton, but has since shifted to a setup that includes an <a href="iMac%20G5">iMac G5</a> and Ableton Live. Despite Sasha's insistence that Ableton Live allows for greater creativity and spontaneity, "vinyl purists" have accused him of taking much of the challenge and mystique out of DJing by using software in performances.

The <a href="Internet">Internet</a> has affected how Sasha obtains and uses tracks for performance. While he once hunted through record shops for new records on a regular basis, Sasha now regularly receives new tracks from producers and labels via the Internet. These tracks, which number in the hundreds each week, are edited by Sasha and others for use in his live DJ sets. He still buys hundreds of records on vinyl, which are then recorded and converted into music files prior to being edited in Ableton by his team of engineers.

In February 2013, Sasha spoke to <a href="Resident%20Advisor">Resident Advisor</a> about his decision to change from using Live and the Maven controller to a combination of <a href="Native%20Instruments">Native Instruments</a>' <a href="Traktor">Traktor</a> and CDs in his DJ sets. He felt that whilst Ableton Live had developed significantly as production software, it had become less successful as a DJing tool.

In 2005, the <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy</a> committee debated whether his mix compilation album, "<a href="Involver">Involver</a>", was eligible for nomination as <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Electronic/Dance%20Album">Best Electronic/Dance Album</a>. <a href="The%20Recording%20Academy">The Recording Academy</a> decided that the album was eligible, but "Involver" did not receive a nomination. Sasha did receive a Grammy nomination for his remix of <a href="Felix%20da%20Housecat">Felix da Housecat</a>'s "Watching Cars Go By", which was featured on "Involver".

Killdeer

The killdeer ("Charadrius vociferus") is a large <a href="plover">plover</a> found in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. It was described and given its current scientific name in 1758 by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". There are three subspecies. The killdeer's common name comes from its often-heard call. Its are mostly brown with <a href="rufous">rufous</a> fringes, the head has patches of white and black, and there are two black breast bands. The belly and the rest of the breast are white. The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a> (or originally described) subspecies breeds from southeastern Alaska and southern Canada to Mexico. It is seen year-round in the southern half of its breeding range; the subspecies "C. v. ternominatus" is probably resident in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> and "C. v. peruvianus" inhabits Peru and areas of the surrounding countries throughout the year. North American breeders winter from their resident range south to Central America, the West Indies, and the northernmost portions of South America.

The non-breeding habitat of the killdeer includes coastal wetlands, beach habitats, and coastal fields. Its breeding grounds are generally open fields with short vegetation (but locations such as rooftops are sometimes used); although it is a shorebird, it does not necessarily nest close to water. The nest itself is a <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a> lined with vegetation and white material, such as pebbles or <a href="seashell">seashell</a> fragments. This bird lays a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of four to six buff to beige eggs with dark markings. The breeding season (starting with egg-laying) occurs from mid-March to August, with later timing of egg-laying in the northern portion of the range. Both parents incubate the young for 22 to 28 days on average. The young stay in the nest until the day after being hatched, when they are led by their parents to a feeding territory (generally with dense vegetation where hiding spots are abundant), where the chicks feed themselves. The young then <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 31 days after hatching, and breeding first occurs after one year of age.

The killdeer primarily feeds on insects, although other invertebrates and seeds are eaten. It <a href="foraging">forage</a>s almost exclusively in fields, especially those with short vegetation and with cattle and standing water. It primarily forages during the day; but, in the non-breeding season, when the moon is full or close to full, it forages at night. This is likely because of increased insect abundance and reduced predation during the night. <a href="Predator">Predator</a>s of the killdeer include various birds and mammals. There are multiple <a href="antipredator%20behavior">responses to predation</a>, ranging from calling to the "ungulate display", which can be fatal for the performing individual. This bird is classified as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), because of its large range and population. However, its population is declining, but this trend is not severe enough for the killdeer to be considered a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>. It is protected by the American <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a> and the Canadian <a href="Migratory%20Birds%20Convention%20Act">Migratory Birds Convention Act</a>.

The killdeer was described in 1758 by Swedish <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" as "Charadrius vociferus", its current <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a>. Linnaeus' description was based on a 1731 account of it by English naturalist <a href="Mark%20Catesby">Mark Catesby</a> in his "The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands", where he called it the "chattering plover". The genus name "Charadrius" is <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. This word derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "kharadrios", a bird found in ravines and river valleys ("kharadra", "ravine"). The specific name " vociferus " is <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, coming from "vox", "cry", and " ferre", "to bear".

There are three subspecies:

The killdeer's common name comes from its frequently heard call.

The killdeer is a large plover, with adults ranging in length from , having a wingspan between about , and usually being between in weight. It has a short, thick, and dark bill, flesh-coloured legs, and a red eye ring.
Its are mostly brown with <a href="rufous">rufous</a> fringes, its cap, back, and wings being the former colour. It has a white forehead and a white stripe behind the eye, and its <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lore</a>s and the upper borders to the white forehead are black. The killdeer also has a white collar with a black upper border. The rest of the face is brown. The breast and belly are white, with the exception of two black breast bands. It is the only plover in North America with two breast bands. The rump is red, and the tail is mostly brown. The latter also has a black <a href="wikt%3Asubterminal">subterminal</a> band, a white <a href="wikt%3Aterminal">terminal</a> band, and barred white feathers on the outer portion of the tail. In flight, a white wing stripe at the base of the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s is visible.

The female's mask and breast bands tend to be browner than those of the male. The adult of the subspecies "Charadrius vociferus ternominatus" is smaller and paler and greyer than the nominate, and the subspecies "C. v. peruvianus" is smaller than the nominate and has more extensive rufous feather fringes. The juvenile is similar to the adult. The upperparts of the chicks are coloured dusky and buff. Their underparts, forehead, neck, and chin are white, and they have a single band across their breast.

The killdeer is a vocal species, calling even at night. Its calls include nasal notes, like "deee", "tyeeee", and "kil-deee" (the basis of its common name). During display flights, it repeats a call of "kil-deer" or "kee-deeyu". When this plover is disturbed, it emits notes in a rapid sequence, such as "kee-di-di-di". Its is a long, fast trill.

The nominate subspecies of the killdeer breeds in the US (including southeastern Alaska), southern Canada, and Mexico, with less widespread grounds further south, to Panama. Some northern populations are <a href="Bird%20migration">migratory</a>. This bird is resident in the southern half of its breeding range, found throughout the year in most of the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. It also winters south to Central America, the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, Colombia, Ecuador, and islands off Venezuela, leaving its breeding grounds after mid-July, with migration peaking from August to September. Migration to the breeding grounds starts in February and ends in mid-May.
The subspecies "Charadrius vociferus ternominatus" is thought to be resident in the Bahamas, <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>, and <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. "C. v. peruvianus" is seen year-round in west Ecuador, Peru, and extreme northwestern Chile.

The killdeer uses beach habitats and coastal wetlands and fields during the non-breeding season. It <a href="foraging">forage</a>s almost exclusively in these fields, especially those with short vegetation and with cattle (which likely shorten the vegetation) and standing water. When breeding, the killdeer has a of about , although this is generally larger when nesting more than away from water. Although generally a low-land species, it is found up to the snowline in meadows and open lakeshores during its autumn migration.

The killdeer forms pairs on its breeding grounds right after arriving. Both sexes (although the male more often than the female) advertise in flight with loud "killdeer" calls. The male also advertises by calling from a high spot, scraping out a dummy nest, and with killdeer flights, where it flies with slow wingbeats across its territory. Ground chases occur when a killdeer has been approached multiple times by another killdeer; similarly, flight chases occur when an individual has been approached from the air. Both are forms of territorial defence.

The killdeer nests in open fields or other flat areas with short vegetation (usually below tall), such as agricultural fields and meadows. Nests are also sometimes located on rooftops. This plover frequently breeds close to where it bred the previous year. The male seems to usually renest in the same area regardless of whether or not it retains the same mate. This does not appear to be true of the female, which has been observed to not use the same territory if it does not have the same mate. The nest itself is merely a shallow depression or scrape in the ground, fringed by some stones and blades of grass. It is generally built with white nesting material instead of darker colours; the function of this is suspected to either help keep the nest cool or conceal it. In a study of <a href="piping%20plover">piping plover</a>s, the former function was supported, as nests were cooler than the surrounding ground. The latter function also had some support, as the plovers generally chose pebbles closer in colour to the eggs; however, nests that contrasted more with the ground suffered more predation. When nesting on rooftops, the killdeer may choose a flat roof, or build a nest of raised gravel, sometimes lined with white pebbles or pieces of seashells.

The eggs of the killdeer are typically laid from mid-March to early June in the southern portion of the range, and from mid-April to mid-July in the northern part. In both cases, the breeding season itself extends to about August. In Puerto Rico, and possibility in other Caribbean islands, breeding occurs year-round.

The killdeer lays a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of four to six eggs that are buff to beige in colour, with brown markings and black speckles. The eggs are about in size, and laid at intervals of 24 to 48 hours. The energy expenditure of both sexes is at its highest during egg-laying; the female needs to produce eggs, and the male needs to defend its territory. Both of the sexes are closer to the nest site than usual during egg-laying and incubation, although the male is generally closer than the female during all stages of breeding. This latter fact is likely due to the male's increased investment in nest-site defence. Up to five replacement clutches can be laid, and there are occasionally two broods. Second broods are usually laid in nesting territory of the first brood. The eggs are incubated for 22 to 28 days by both the male and the female, with the former typically incubating at night. The time dedicated to incubation is related to temperature, with one study recording that killdeer incubated eggs 99% of the time when the temperature was about , 76% of the time around , and 87% of the time at about . When it is hot (above at least ), incubation cools the eggs, generally through shading by one of the parents.
About 53% of eggs are lost, mainly to predators. The young are , starting to walk within the first days of their life. After they hatch, both parents lead them out of the nest, generally to a feeding territory with dense vegetation the chicks can hide under when a <a href="predator">predator</a> is near. The chicks are raised, at least in single-brood pairs, by both parents, likely because of the high failure rate of nests and the need for both parents to be present to successfully raise the young. In these broods, the young are usually attended by one parent at a time (generally the female) until about two weeks of age, after which both parents are occasionally seen together with the chicks. Otherwise, the non-attentive adult is at least about away from the chicks. Periods of attentiveness for each parent generally last from about one to one and a half hours. When the chicks are young, this is mainly spent standing; as the chicks get older, less time is dedicated to standing. When the young are below two weeks of age, the attending adult spends little time feeding; foraging time increases as the chicks grow. The non-attentive adult defends the young most of the time when they are less than a week old, but this task steadily shifts onto the attentive adult, until about three weeks of age, when the attending parent does almost all of the defence. One parent at a time broods the chicks, and does so frequently until they are two days old. The young are brooded during rain until about 15 days after hatching and during night for about 18 days after hatching. The only time when they are not in the presence of a parent is when the parents are mating or responding to a predator or aggressive conspecific.

When a pair has two broods, the second is usually attended by just the male (who is able to hatch the eggs on his own, unlike the female). In this case, the male does not spend most of the time standing; the amount of time it does stand, though, stays constant as the chicks age. Like attentive adults in two parent broods, the sole parent increases the time spent foraging as the young age.

The young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 31 days after hatching, and generally move to moister areas in valleys and on the banks of rivers. They may be cared for by their parents for up to 10 days after they fledge, and exceptionally for 81 days after hatching. About 52% to 63% of nests fail to produce any fledged young. Breeding starts after one year of age. The killdeer has a maximum lifespan of at least 10 years and 11 months.

The killdeer feeds primarily on insects (especially beetles and flies), in addition to millipedes, worms, snails, spiders, and some seeds. It opportunistically takes <a href="tree%20frog">tree frog</a>s and dead <a href="minnow">minnow</a>s. It forages almost exclusively in fields (no matter the tide), especially those with short vegetation and with cattle (which likely shorten the vegetation) and standing water. Standing water alone does not have a significant effect on field choice unless combined with cattle. Viable <a href="disseminule">disseminule</a>s can be recovered from killdeer faeces, indicating that this bird is important in transporting aquatic organisms.

The killdeer uses visual cues to forage. An example of this is "foot-trembling", where it stands on one foot, shaking the other in shallow water for about five seconds, pecking at any prey stirred up. When feeding in fields, it sometimes follows ploughs to take earthworms disturbed to the surface. The female forages significantly more than the male during most stages of breeding. The former feeds the most before and during egg-laying, the least when incubation starts (as there is little time to feed), with a return to high levels after. During the non-breeding season, the killdeer forages during the night, depending on the lunar cycle. When the moon is full, it feeds more at night and roosts more during the day. Foraging at night has benefits for this bird, including increased insect abundance and reduced predation.

The killdeer is parasitized by <a href="acanthocephalan">acanthocephalan</a>s, <a href="cestode">cestode</a>s, <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, and <a href="trematode">trematode</a>s. It is preyed upon by <a href="herring%20gull">herring gull</a>s, <a href="common%20crow">common crow</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, and <a href="striped%20skunk">striped skunk</a>s. The mentioned birds and other avian predators are the majority of predators in some areas during the breeding season. Predation is not limited to eggs and chicks: <a href="mustelid">mustelid</a>s, for example, can kill incubating adults.

The parents use various methods to distract predators during the breeding season. One method is the "broken-wing display", also known as "injury feigning". Before displaying, it usually runs from its nest, making alarm calls and other disturbances. When the bird has the attention of the predator, the former turns its tail towards the latter, displaying the threatening orange colour of the rump. It then crouches, droops its wings, and lowers its tail. With an increasing intensity, the wings are held higher, the tail is fanned out, and the tail becomes more depressed. Another behaviour that has received attention is the "ungulate display", where the adult raises its wings, exposes its rump, lowers its head, and charges at the intruder. This can be fatal, however, to the displaying bird.

The intensity of the responses to predators varies throughout the breeding season. During egg-laying, the most common response to predators is to quietly leave the nest. As incubation starts and progresses, the intensity of predator responses increases, peaking after hatching. This is probably because it is worth more to protect the young then, as they are more likely to fledge. After hatching, reactions decrease in intensity, until a normal response is calling. This is because the young become more independent as they age.

The killdeer is considered a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>. This is due to its large range of about and population, estimated by the IUCN to be about one million birds, or about two million, according to the <a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">Handbook of the Birds of the World</a> Alive. Even though the population is declining, it is not decreasing fast enough to be considered a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>. It is protected in the US by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, and in Canada by the <a href="Migratory%20Birds%20Convention%20Act">Migratory Birds Convention Act</a>.

When the original television series was canceled in 1969, "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> lobbied <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> to continue the franchise through a feature film. The success of the series in <a href="Broadcast%20syndication">syndication</a> convinced the studio to begin work on the film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a "suitably epic" script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots, with a new television series titled "". But the box-office success of "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>" convinced Paramount that science-fiction films other than "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" could do well, so the studio canceled production of "Phase II" and resumed its attempts at making a "Star Trek" film. In 1978, Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since the 1950s to announce that two-time <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>–winning director <a href="Robert%20Wise">Robert Wise</a> would direct a $15 million film adaptation of the original television series. With the cancellation of "Phase II", writers rushed to adapt its planned pilot episode, "In Thy Image", into a film script. Constant revisions to the story and the shooting script continued to the extent of hourly script updates on shooting dates. The "Enterprise" was modified inside and out, costume designer <a href="Robert%20Fletcher%20%28costume%20designer%29">Robert Fletcher</a> provided new uniforms, and production designer <a href="Harold%20Michelson">Harold Michelson</a> fabricated new sets. <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> composed the film's score, beginning an association with "Star Trek" that would continue until 2002. When the original contractors for the optical effects proved unable to complete their tasks in time, effects supervisor <a href="Douglas%20Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a> was given carte blanche to meet the film's December 1979 release date. The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise took the just-completed film to its Washington, D.C., opening, but always felt that the final theatrical version was a <a href="rough%20cut">rough cut</a> of the film he wanted to make.

Released in North America on December 7, 1979, "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" received mixed reviews, many of which faulted it for a lack of action scenes and overreliance on special effects. Its final production cost ballooned to approximately $46 million, and it earned $139 million worldwide, short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to propose a less expensive sequel. Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for the sequel, "" (1982). In 2001, Wise oversaw a director's cut for a special DVD release of the film, with remastered audio, tightened and added scenes, and new <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated effects</a>.

A <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> monitoring station, "Epsilon Nine", detects an alien force, hidden in a massive cloud of energy, moving through space toward Earth. The cloud easily destroys three of the <a href="Klingon%20Empire">Klingon Empire</a>'s new <a href="K%27t%27inga%20class">"K't'inga"-class</a> warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship "<a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">Enterprise</a>" is undergoing a major refit; its former commanding officer, <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, has been promoted to Admiral and works in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches "Enterprise" to investigate the cloud entity as the ship is the only one in intercept range, requiring its new systems to be tested in transit.

Citing his experience, Kirk takes command of the ship, angering Captain <a href="Willard%20Decker">Willard Decker</a>, who had been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of "Enterprise"s new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan "Enterprise" science officer <a href="Sonak">Sonak</a>, are killed by a malfunctioning <a href="Transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">transporter</a>, and improperly calibrated engines nearly destroy the "Enterprise". Kirk's unfamiliarity with the ship's new systems increases the tension between him and Decker, who has been temporarily demoted to first officer. Commander <a href="Spock">Spock</a> arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud, and was unable to complete the ritual because his human half felt an emotional connection to it.

"Enterprise" intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within. A probe appears on the bridge, attacks Spock and abducts the navigator, <a href="Ilia%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Ilia</a>. She is replaced by a robotic <a href="replica">replica</a>, another probe sent by "V'Ger" to study the crew. Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia, with whom he had a romantic history. He becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelgänger, which has Ilia's memories and feelings buried inside. Spock takes a spacewalk to the alien vessel's interior and attempts a telepathic <a href="Vulcan%20mind%20meld">mind meld</a> with it. In doing so, he learns that the vessel is V'Ger itself, a living machine.

At the center of the massive ship, V'Ger is revealed to be "<a href="Voyager%20program%23In%20popular%20culture">Voyager 6</a>", a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost in a black hole. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey, the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a purpose other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence meaningless. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Everyone realizes humans are the Creator. Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs "Enterprise" out to space for future missions.


Other actors from the television series who returned included <a href="Majel%20Barrett">Majel Barrett</a> as <a href="Christine%20Chapel">Christine Chapel</a>, a doctor aboard the "Enterprise", and <a href="Grace%20Lee%20Whitney">Grace Lee Whitney</a> as <a href="Janice%20Rand">Janice Rand</a>, formerly one of Kirk's yeomen. David Gautreaux, who had been cast as Xon in the aborted second television series, cameos as Branch, the commander of the Epsilon 9 communications station. <a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a> portrays the Klingon commander in the film's opening sequence; the actor also played Spock's father, <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a>, in the television series and in later feature films.

The original "" television series ran for three seasons from 1966 to 1969 on NBC. The show was never a hit with network executives, and the show's low <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> bolstered their concerns. When the show was canceled, owner <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> hoped to recoup their production losses by selling the syndication rights. The series went into reruns in the autumn (September/October) of 1969, and by the late 1970s had been sold in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. The show developed a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>, and rumors of reviving the franchise began.
Roddenberry had first proposed a "Star Trek" feature at the 1968 <a href="Worldcon">World Science Fiction Convention</a>. The movie was to have been set before the television series, showing how the crew of the "Enterprise" met. The popularity of the syndicated "Star Trek" caused Paramount and Roddenberry to begin developing the film in May 1975. Roddenberry was allocated $3 to $5 million to develop a script. By June 30, he had produced what he considered an acceptable script, but studio executives disagreed. This first draft, "", featured a grounded Admiral Kirk assembling the old crew on the refitted "Enterprise" to clash with a godlike entity many miles across, hurtling towards Earth. The object turns out to be a super-advanced computer, the remains of a scheming race who were cast out of their dimension. Kirk wins out, the entity returns to its dimension, and the "Enterprise" crew resumes their voyages. The basic premise and scenes such as a transporter accident and Spock's Vulcan ritual were discarded, but later returned to the script. The film was postponed until spring (March/April) 1976 while Paramount fielded new scripts for "Star Trek II" (the working title) from acclaimed writers such as <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a> and <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>. Ellison's story had a snake-like alien race tampering with Earth's history to create a kindred race; Kirk reunites with his old crew, but they are faced with the dilemma of killing off the reptilian race in Earth's prehistory just to maintain humanity's dominance. When Ellison presented his idea, an executive suggested Ellison read "<a href="Chariots%20of%20the%20Gods%3F">Chariots of the Gods?</a>" and include the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> into his story, which enraged the writer because he knew Maya did not exist at the dawn of time. By October 1976, <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a> had been signed to work on the screenplay along with a second writer, <a href="John%20D.%20F.%20Black">John D. F. Black</a>, whose treatment featured a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> that threatened to consume all of existence. Roddenberry teamed up with <a href="Jon%20Povill">Jon Povill</a> to write a new story that featured the "Enterprise" crew setting an altered universe right by time travel; like Black's idea, Paramount did not consider it epic enough.

The original "Star Trek" cast—who had agreed to appear in the new movie, with contracts as-yet unsigned pending script approval—grew anxious about the constant delays, and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount. The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division, reasoning that since the roots of the franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script. A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected. As Paramount executives' interest in the film began to wane, Roddenberry, backed by fan letters, applied pressure to the studio. In June 1976, Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg, a young and active producer, to be executive producer of the project, with the budget expanded to $8 million. Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script. His list included <a href="Edward%20Anhalt">Edward Anhalt</a>, <a href="James%20Goldman">James Goldman</a>, <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a> and <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>. To cap off his list, Povill put as his last recommendation "Jon Povill—almost credit: "Star Trek II" story (with Roddenberry). Will be a big shot some day. Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble." The end result was a list of 34 names, none of whom were chosen to pen the script. Finally, British screenwriters <a href="Chris%20Bryant%20%28writer%29">Chris Bryant</a> and <a href="Allan%20Scott%20%28Scottish%20screenwriter%29">Allan Scott</a>, who had penned the <a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a> thriller "<a href="Don%27t%20Look%20Now">Don't Look Now</a>" were hired to write a script. Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; "one of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>'s captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors, including Coppola, <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, Lucas and <a href="Robert%20Wise">Robert Wise</a>, but all were busy at the time (or unwilling to work on the small budget). <a href="Philip%20Kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> signed on to direct and was given a crash course in the series. Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for him, including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular: "<a href="The%20City%20on%20the%20Edge%20of%20Forever">The City on the Edge of Forever</a>", "<a href="The%20Devil%20in%20the%20Dark">The Devil in the Dark</a>", "<a href="Amok%20Time">Amok Time</a>", "<a href="Journey%20to%20Babel">Journey to Babel</a>", "", "<a href="The%20Trouble%20with%20Tribbles">The Trouble with Tribbles</a>", "", "<a href="The%20Corbomite%20Maneuver">The Corbomite Maneuver</a>", "" and "". Early work was promising and, by the fall of 1976, the project was building momentum.
During this time, fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with letters, influencing <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> to rechristen the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> "Constitution" the "<a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Enterprise">Enterprise</a>", and Roddenberry and most of the "Star Trek" cast were present for its rollout on September 17, 1976.

On October 8, 1976, Bryant and Scott delivered a 20-page treatment, "", which executives <a href="Barry%20Diller">Barry Diller</a> and <a href="Michael%20Eisner">Michael Eisner</a> liked. In it, Kirk and his crew encounter beings they believe to be the mythical <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a> and travel back millions of years in time, accidentally teaching early man to <a href="making%20fire">make fire</a>. "Planet of the Titans" also explored the concept of the <a href="third%20eye">third eye</a>. With the studio's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on "Star Trek", and the screenwriters and Isenberg were deluged with grateful fan mail. Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators. Key among these were famed production designer <a href="Ken%20Adam">Ken Adam</a>, who said, "I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and we got on like a house on fire"; he was employed to design the film. Adam hired artist <a href="Ralph%20McQuarrie">Ralph McQuarrie</a>, fresh off the yet to be released "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>". They worked on designs for planets, planetary and asteroid bases, a black hole "shroud", a crystalline "super brain", and new concepts for the "Enterprise", including interiors that Adam later revisited for the film "<a href="Moonraker%20%28film%29">Moonraker</a>" and a flat-hulled starship design (frequently credited to McQuarrie, but which McQuarrie's own book identifies as an Adam design). McQuarrie wrote that "there was no script" and that much of the work was "winging it". When that film folded after three months for Adam and "a month and a half" for McQuarrie, their concepts were shelved, although a handful of them were revisited in later productions.

The first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and it was described as "a script by committee" and rejected by the studio a few weeks later. Bryant and Scott had been caught between Roddenberry and Kaufman's conflicting ideas of what the film should be and Paramount's indecision. Feeling it was "physically impossible" to produce a script that satisfied all parties, they left the project by mutual consent on March 18, 1977. "We begged to be fired." Kaufman reconceived the story with Spock as the captain of his own ship and featuring <a href="Toshiro%20Mifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> as Spock's <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> nemesis, but on May 8 Katzenberg informed the director the film was canceled, less than three weeks before "Star Wars" was released.

Barry Diller had grown concerned by the direction "Star Trek" had taken in "Planet of the Titans", and suggested to Roddenberry that it was time to take the franchise back to its roots as a television series. Diller planned on a new "Star Trek" series forming the cornerstone for <a href="Paramount%20Television%20Service">a new television network</a>. Though Paramount was loath to abandon its work on the film, Roddenberry wanted to bring many of the production staff from the original series to work on the new show, titled "".

Producer Harold Livingston was assigned to find writers for new episodes, while Roddenberry prepared a writers' guide briefing the uninitiated on the franchise canon. Of the original cast, only Leonard Nimoy stated he would not return. To replace Spock, Roddenberry created a logical Vulcan prodigy named Xon. Since Xon was too young to fill the role of first officer, Roddenberry developed Commander William Decker, and later added Ilia. The new series' pilot episode "In Thy Image" was based on a two-page outline by Roddenberry about a NASA probe returning to Earth, having gained sentience. <a href="Alan%20Dean%20Foster">Alan Dean Foster</a> wrote a treatment for the pilot, which Livingston turned into a teleplay. When the script was presented to Michael Eisner, he declared it worthy of a feature film. At the same time, the success of "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>" showed Paramount that "Star Wars"' success at the box office could repeat. On November 11, just two and a half weeks before production on "Phase II" was due to start, the studio announced that the television series had been canceled in favor of a new feature film. Cast and crew who had been hired that Monday were laid off by Friday, and construction came to a halt. Production was moved to April 1978 so that the necessary scripts, sets, and wardrobe could be upgraded.

On March 28, 1978, Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> announced he was making "<a href="The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29">The Ten Commandments</a>". Eisner announced that Academy Award-winning director <a href="Robert%20Wise">Robert Wise</a> would direct a film adaptation of the television series titled "Star Trek—The Motion Picture". Wise had seen only a few "Star Trek" episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15 million. Dennis Clark ("<a href="Comes%20a%20Horseman">Comes a Horseman</a>") was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and though he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.

The writers began to adapt "In Thy Image" into a film script, but it was not completed until four months after production commenced. Wise felt that the story was sound, but the action and visuals could be made more exciting. As the intended start of filming in late spring 1978 approached, it was clear a new start date was needed. Time was of the essence; Paramount was worried that their science fiction film would appear at the tail end of a cycle, now that every major studio had such a film in the works. Livingston described the writers' issue with the story, calling it "unworkable":
We had a marvelous antagonist, so omnipotent that for us to defeat it or even communicate with it, or have any kind of relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false. Here's this gigantic machine that's a million years further advanced than we are. Now, how the hell can we possibly deal with this? On what level? As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this thing? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine, it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really "is" great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? "Should" they defeat it? Who is the story's hero anyway? That was the problem. We experimented with all kinds of approaches...we didn't know what to do with the ending. We always ended up against a blank wall.

Because of likely changes, actors were at first told to not memorize the last third of the script, which received constant input from the producers and Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, right up to the day the pages were to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the biggest push for alteration revolved around the ending. Much of the rewriting had to do with the relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the "Enterprise" and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a "<a href="Penthouse%20%28magazine%29">Penthouse</a>" interview where NASA director <a href="Robert%20Jastrow">Robert Jastrow</a> said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending might not have been approved at all. By March 1979, fewer than 20 pages from the original 150 in the screenplay had been retained.

The first new sets (intended for "Phase II") were constructed beginning July 25, 1977. The fabrication was supervised by <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Jennings">Joseph Jennings</a>, an art director involved in the original television series, special-effects expert Jim Rugg, and former "Trek" designer <a href="Matt%20Jefferies">Matt Jefferies</a>, on loan as consultant from "<a href="Little%20House%20on%20the%20Prairie%20%28TV%20series%29">Little House on the Prairie</a>". When the television series was cancelled and plans for a film put into place, new sets were needed for the large <a href="70%20mm%20film">70 mm film format</a>.

Wise asked <a href="Harold%20Michelson">Harold Michelson</a> to be the film's production designer, and Michelson was put to work on finishing the incomplete "Phase II" sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto one side of the bridge wall. The idea for "Phase II" was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the "Enterprise"s main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator <a href="Michael%20Minor">Michael Minor</a> created a new look for the station using a flat edge in the corner of the set.

The bridge ceiling was redesigned, with Michelson taking structural inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling to give the bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned as a piece of sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS "Enterprise Flight Manual" as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25 watts to 6 watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered it would be easier to move them by hand.

Aside from control interfaces, the bridge set was populated with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8 mm and 16 mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films for this purpose from an <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted only a few weeks into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, <a href="Rick%20Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a>, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an <a href="oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over 200 pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.

The "Enterprise" engine room was redesigned while keeping consistent with the theory that the interior appearance had to match the corresponding area visible in exterior views of the starship. Michelson wanted the engine room to seem vast, a difficult effect to achieve on a small sound stage. To create the illusion of depth and long visible distances, the art department staff worked on designs that would utilize <a href="forced%20perspective">forced perspective</a>; set designer Lewis Splittgerber considered the engine room the most difficult set to realize. On film the engine room appeared hundreds of feet long, but the set was actually only in length. To achieve the proper look, the floor slanted upward and narrowed, while small actors three, four, and five feet in height were used as extras to give the appearance of being far from the camera. For "down shots" of the engineering complex, floor paintings extended the length of the warp core several stories. J.C. Backings Company created these paintings; similar backings were used to extend the length of ship hallways and the <a href="recreation%20room">rec room</a> set.

Redesigning the "Enterprise" corridors was also Michelson's responsibility. Originally the corridors were of straight plywood construction reminiscent of the original series, which Roddenberry called "Des Moines Holiday Inn Style". To move away from that look, Michelson created a new, bent and angular design. Roddenberry and Wise agreed with Michelson that in 300 years, lighting did not need to be overhead, so they had the lighting radiate upward from the floor. Different lighting schemes were used to simulate different decks of the ship with the same length of corridor. Aluminum panels on the walls outside Kirk's and Ilia's quarters were covered with an orange <a href="ultrasuede">ultrasuede</a> to represent the living area of the ship.

The transporter had originally been developed for the television series as a matter of convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the "Enterprise" land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting for atmosphere.

After the redesign of the "Enterprise" sets was complete, Michelson turned his attention to creating the original sets needed for the film. The recreation deck occupied an entire soundstage, dwarfing the small room built for the planned television series; this was the largest interior in the film. The set was high, decorated with 107 pieces of custom-designed furniture, and packed with 300 people for filming. Below a large viewing screen on one end of the set was a series of art panels containing illustrations of previous ships bearing the name "Enterprise". One of the ships was NASA's own "Enterprise", added per Roddenberry's request:
Some fans have suggested that our new "Enterprise" should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is an intriguing idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave it to you where you want it on the vessel.
Another large construction task was the "Vger" set, referred to by the production staff as "the Coliseum" or "the microwave wok". The set was designed and fabricated in four and a half weeks, and was filmable from all angles; parts of the set were designed to pull away for better camera access at the center. Throughout production "Star Trek" used 11 of Paramount's 32 sound stages, more than any other film done there at the time. To save money, construction coordinator Gene Kelley struck sets with his own crew immediately after filming, lest Paramount charge the production to have the sets dismantled. The final cost for constructing the sets ran at approximately $1.99 million, not counting additional costs for "Phase II" fabrication.

The first "Star Trek" movie models constructed were small study models for "Planet of the Titans" based on designs by Adam and McQuarrie, but these flat-hulled "Enterprise" concepts were abandoned when that film was cancelled (although one was later used in the spacedock in the movie "", and another later appeared in the "" episode "").

When the "Phase II" series was in development, original series designer Matt Jefferies updated the "Enterprise" design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly at the base of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time "Phase II" was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the "Enterprise" was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price "Enterprise" was repurposed as the exploded "Enterprise" wreck in "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock").

When the project finally became "The Motion Picture", Robert Abel and Associates art director Richard Taylor wanted to completely redesign the ship, but Roddenberry insisted on the same shape as designed by Jefferies for "Phase II". Taylor focused on the details, giving it a stylization he considered "almost <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>". Concept artist <a href="Andrew%20Probert">Andrew Probert</a> helped refine the redesign. The general shape and proportions of the "Phase II" ship were retained, but the angles, curves and details refined. Taylor took on the nacelles, and Probert the rest of the ship. Changes included "radiator grill" nacelle caps, a glowing deflector dish, a new impulse engine, new shapes for the aft end and hangar doors of the secondary hull, more docking ports, rounder windows, hatches, and windows for an observation lounge, recreation deck, and arboretum. Probert also replaced the "Phase II" ship weapons tube with a twin launcher torpedo deck and added elements such as features for a separating saucer and landing pads that were never utilized on any film featuring the model.

Most of the models in "The Motion Picture" were created by Magicam, a Paramount subsidiary. The main "Enterprise" model was eight feet long, to a scale of 1/120th scale size, or to . It took 14 months and $150,000 to build. Instead of standard fiberglass used for older models, the new "Enterprise" was constructed with lightweight plastics, weighing . The biggest design issue was making sure that the connective dorsal neck and twin warp nacelle struts were strong enough so that no part of the ship model would sag, bend, or quiver when the model was being moved, which was accomplished via an arc-welded aluminum skeleton. The completed model could be supported at one of five possible points as each photographic angle required. A second, 20-inch (50.8 cm) model of the ship was used for long shots. While the hull surface was kept smooth, it was treated with a special paint finish that made its surface appear iridescent in certain light. Transparencies of the film's sets were inserted behind some windows, and as jokes, some featured Probert, other production staff members, and <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>. The "Enterprise" was revised again after Abel & Associates were dismissed.

Magicam also produced the orbital dry dock seen during the "Enterprise"s first appearance in the film. Measuring 4 ft x 10 ft x 6 ft (1.22m x 3.05m x 1.83m), its 56 neon panels required 168,000 volts of electricity to operate, with a separate table to support the transformers; the final price for the dock setup was $200,000.
The creation of V'Ger caused problems for the entire production. The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot clay model created by the Abel group, which looked like a modernized Nemo's "<a href="Nautilus%20%28Verne%29">Nautilus</a>" submarine. Industrial designer <a href="Syd%20Mead">Syd Mead</a> was hired to visualize a new version of the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. The final model was long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, macramé, Styrofoam cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.

Dick Rubin handled the film's props, and set up a makeshift office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested on the first day of shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch <a href="Dick%20Tracy">Dick Tracy</a> had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.
Roddenberry firmly believed that throwaway clothes were the future of the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of "The Motion Picture". <a href="William%20Ware%20Theiss">William Ware Theiss</a>, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead <a href="Robert%20Fletcher%20%28costume%20designer%29">Robert Fletcher</a>, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the <a href="Starfleet%20uniforms">Starfleet uniforms</a>, with their bright reds, blues, greens and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher believed that the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.

In the original series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes were moved to small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in <a href="gabardine">gabardine</a> and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making <a href="Gucci">Gucci</a> shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. <a href="Jumpsuit">Jumpsuit</a>s, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight <a href="spandex">spandex</a> that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.

For the civilians of San Francisco, Fletcher decided on a greater freedom in dress. Much of the materials for these casual clothes were found in the old storerooms at Paramount, where a large amount of unused or forgotten silks, crepes, and leathers lay in storage. One bolt of material had been handpicked by Cecil DeMille in 1939, and was in perfect condition. The red, black, and gold brocade was woven with real gold and silver wrapped around silk thread; the resulting costume was used for a Betelgeusean ambassador and, at a price of $10,000 for the fabric alone, was the most expensive costume ever worn by a Hollywood extra. Fletcher also recycled suedes from "The Ten Commandments" for the Zaranite costumes. With the approval of Roddenberry, Fletcher fashioned complete backgrounds for the alien races seen in the Earth and recreation deck sequences, describing their appearances and the composition of their costumes.

<a href="Fred%20Phillips%20%28makeup%20artist%29">Fred Phillips</a>, the original designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as "The Motion Picture"s makeup artist. He and his staff were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with "Star Trek" Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of "The Motion Picture". Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved the original television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While on the small screen the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.

Besides developing Vulcan ears and alien masks, Phillips and his assistant Charles Schram applied more routine makeup to the principal actors. Khambatta's head had to be freshly shaved each day, then given an application of makeup to reduce glare from the hot set lights. Khambatta had no qualms about shaving her head at first, but began worrying if her hair would grow back properly. Roddenberry proposed insuring Khambatta's hair after the actress voiced her concerns, believing the price of such insurance to be negligible. Roddenberry also saw other benefits to taking out a policy:
...Second, [the insurance] would have the advantage of reassuring [Khambatta] and making her feel more comfortable during her role. Third and finally, if the price does turn out to be negligible, John Rothwell, our publicist, assures me that we would probably get many times the cost back in publicity about the insurance.
The idea was ultimately scrapped, as it turned out such a guarantee would be highly expensive; the insurance company believed that there would be difficulty in proving that the hair grew back "exactly" the same as before. Instead, Khambatta visited the Georgette Klinger Skin Care Salon in Beverly Hills, where experts recommended that she receive six facials and scalp treatments during the course of production. The salon also prescribed a daily scalp treatment routine of cleansing bars, brilliantine lotion, conditioner, makeup remover, and cleansing lotion. The studio agreed these measures were necessary and footed the bill while Khambatta spent six months following the tedious instructions (her hair eventually regrew without issue, though she kept her shaven locks after production had ended.)

In the decade between the end of the "Star Trek" television series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the "Enterprise" be grounded in established science and scientific theories. "The Motion Picture" likewise received technical consultation from <a href="NASA">NASA</a>, the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> at California Institute of Technology, and the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>.

The greatest amount of technical advice for the production came from the <a href="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), who provided "Trek" fan <a href="Jesco%20von%20Puttkamer">Jesco von Puttkamer</a> as advisor to the film. Roddenberry had known Puttkamer since 1975, when they had been introduced by a mutual friend, the Assistant Director of Astronautics at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. From 1976 until the completion of the film Puttkamer provided the writers, producer, and director with memos on everything technical in the script; the scientist reviewed every line in the script, and was unpaid for his assistance. "Science fiction films, including those of the recent past, have been woefully short of good science advice", he said. ""Star Wars" [is] really not science fiction. I loved it, but it's a fairy tale of princes and knights in another galaxy. The technology was improbable, the science impossible."

During the rewrite of the final scenes, the studio executives clashed with Roddenberry about the script's ending, believing that the concept of a living machine was too far-fetched. The executives consulted Asimov: if the writer decided a sentient machine was plausible, the ending could stay. Asimov loved the ending, but made one small suggestion; he felt that the use of the word "wormhole" was incorrect, and that the anomaly that the "Enterprise" found itself in would be more accurately called a "temporal tunnel".

Filming of "The Motion Picture"s first scene began on August 7, 1978. A few ad-libbed ceremonies were performed before the cameras rolled; Roddenberry gave Wise his baseball cap, emblazoned with "Enterprise" in gold lettering (the cap was a gift from the captain of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28CVN-65%29">nuclear carrier "Enterprise"</a>.) Wise and Roddenberry then cracked a special breakaway bottle of champagne on the bridge set (there was no liquid inside, as flying champagne would have damaged the readied set). The scene planned was the chaotic mess aboard the "Enterprise" bridge as the crew readies the ship for space travel; Wise directed 15 takes into the late afternoon before he was content with the scene. The first day's shots used of film; were considered "good", were judged "no good", and were wasted; only one and one-eighth pages had been shot.

Alex Weldon was hired to be supervisor of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42 years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on "Star Trek" because she thought he did not have enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and the other members of the special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.

<a href="Richard%20H.%20Kline">Richard H. Kline</a> served as the film's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano's concepts, Wise would judge if they were on the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the look they wanted (along with Weldon, if effects were involved). Each sequence was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to "interpret [the] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." Kline recalled that there was not a single "easy" shot to produce for the picture, as each required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better. It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print.
While Kline was concerned with lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, the script supervisor, took notes that would be written up after the company had finished for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving as fast as possible and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.

Despite tight security around production, in February 1978 the head of an <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County, California</a> Star Trek fan group reported to the FBI that a man offered to sell plans of the film set. The seller was convicted of stealing a <a href="trade%20secret">trade secret</a>, fined $750, and sentenced to two years' probation. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="Tony%20Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>, <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> and <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>. Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared this inconvenience. "New West" magazine in March 1979 nonetheless revealed most of the plot, including Spock's arrival on the "Enterprise", V'Ger's identity, and its reason for coming to Earth.

By August 9, the production was already a full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. He was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never did. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to ensure that dialogue and characterizations were consistent with the show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24 frames per second, and then at the faster 48 frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.
The planet Vulcan setting was created using a mixture of on-location photography at Minerva Hot Springs in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> and set recreation. Yellowstone was selected after filming in Turkish ruins proved to be too expensive. Securing permission for filming the scenes was difficult in the middle of the summer tourist season, but the Parks Department acquiesced so long as the crew remained on the boardwalks to prevent damage to geological formations. Zuberano, who had helped select the site for the shoot, traveled to Yellowstone and returned with a number of photos. Minor also made a trip and returned to create a large painting depicting how the scene might look. In consultations with Michelson, the crew decided to use miniatures in the foreground to create the Vulcan temples, combined with the real hot springs in the background. In the film, the bottom third of the frames were composed of miniature stairs, rocks, bits of red glass and a Vulcan statue. The center of the frame contained Nimoy's shots and the park setting, while the final third of the frame was filled with a matte painting. On August 8, the day after production began at Paramount, an 11-person second unit left for Yellowstone. The sequence took three days to shoot.

On returning to Paramount, the art department had to recreate parts of Yellowstone in a large "B tank", long. The tank was designed to be flooded with millions of gallons of water to represent large bodies of water. Minor set up miniatures on the tank's floor before construction and made sure that the shadows that fell on Spock at Yellowstone could be properly recreated. A plywood base was built on metal platforms to create stone silhouettes, reinforced with chicken wire. Polyurethane foam was sprayed over the framework under the supervision of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The bottom part of the statue miniature was represented by a high fiberglass foot. Weldon matched the effects filmed at Yellowstone using dry ice and steam machines. To recreate the appearance of the swirling eddies of water in the real Yellowstone, a combination of evaporated milk, white poster paint, and water was poured into the set's pools. The pressure of the steam channeled into the pools through hidden tubing causes enough movement in the whirlpools to duplicate the location footage. Due to the requirement that the sun be in a specific location for filming and that the environment be bright enough, production fell behind schedule when it was unseasonably cloudy for three days straight. Any further scenes to recreate Vulcan would be impossible, as the set was immediately torn down to serve as a parking lot for the remainder of the summer.

The computer console explosion that causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using <a href="Brillo%20Pad">brillo pads</a>. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an <a href="Arc%20welding">arc welder</a> to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by <a href="anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a> throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid that oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not show up in the deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.
As August ended, production continued to slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned that rather than being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, "Enterprise"s approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned when some of the solution leaked through to his arm.

Khambatta also faced difficulties during filming. She refused to appear nude as called for in the script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold as a result of the shower mist created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid <a href="hypercapnia">hypercapnia</a>. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.

The last week of production was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles in the air to be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.

Two weeks later, the entire cast and crew joined with studio executives for a traditional wrap party. Four hundred people attended the gathering, which spilled over into two restaurants in Beverly Hills. While much of the crew readied for post-production, Wise and Roddenberry were grateful for the opportunity to take a short vacation from the motion picture before returning to work.

While the cast departed to work on other projects, the post-production team was tasked with finalizing the film in time for a Christmas release; the resulting work would take twice as long as the filming process had taken. Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography syncing film and audio tracks. The resulting rough cuts were used to formulate plans for sound effects, music, and optical effects that would be added later.

Roddenberry also provided a large amount of input, sending memos to Ramsay via Wise with ideas for editing. Ramsay tried to cut as much unnecessary footage as he could as long as the film's character and story development were not damaged. One of Roddenberry's ideas was to have the Vulcans speak their own language. Because the original Vulcan scenes had been photographed with actors speaking English, the "language" needed to lip-sync with the actor's lines.
After the groundbreaking opticals of "Star Wars", "The Motion Picture"s producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. <a href="Douglas%20Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a>, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood who had worked on "", was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on "Close Encounters", and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, <a href="John%20Dykstra">John Dykstra</a>, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested <a href="Robert%20Abel%20%28animator%29">Robert Abel</a>'s production company <a href="Robert%20Abel%20and%20Associates">Robert Abel and Associates</a> might be up to the task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became "The Motion Picture". Abel and Associates bid $4 million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.

Rumors surfaced about difficulties regarding the special effects. A year into the production, millions of dollars had been spent but almost no usable footage had been created; Abel and Associates was not experienced in motion picture production and the steep learning curve worried the producers. Effects artist <a href="Richard%20Yuricich">Richard Yuricich</a> acted as a liaison between Abel and Paramount. To speed up the work, Abel passed off miniature and matte painting tasks to Yuricich. Despite being relieved of nearly half the effects work, it became clear by early 1979 that Abel and Associates would not be able to complete the remainder on time. By then Trumbull was supervising effects, greatly reducing Abel's role. (Because of Trumbull's disinterest in only working on special effects, he reportedly received a six-figure salary and the chance to direct his own film.) Creative differences grew between Abel and Associates and the Paramount production team; Wise reportedly became angry during a viewing of Abel's completed effects, of which the studio decided only one was usable. Paramount fired Abel and Associates on 22 February 1979.

The studio had wasted $5 million and a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, although Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money, and allegedly sold other Paramount-funded equipment. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed "Close Encounters" but his plan for a full feature had been canceled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on "Star Trek". With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for "The Motion Picture"s optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche if he could get the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10 million.

Yuricich's previous work had been as Director of Photography for Photographic Effects on "Close Encounters", and he and Trumbull reassembled the crew and equipment from the feature, adding more personnel and space. Time, not money, was the main issue; Trumbull had to deliver in nine months twice the effects as found in "Star Wars" or "Close Encounters", which had taken years to complete. The Glencoe-based facilities the teams had used for "Close Encounters" were deemed insufficient, and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems. Dykstra and his 60-person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull.
Trumbull and Dykstra found the Magicam models problematic. The Klingon cruiser's lighting was so dim that there was no way to make them bright enough on film. As Trumbull also felt the "Enterprise"s lights were ill-suited for his needs, he rewired both models. He questioned that the "Enterprise" could be traveling years from any source of light and yet still be fully illuminated. Instead of having the ship completely dark save for viewports, Trumbull came up with a system of self-illumination; he pictured the ship as something like an oceanliner, "a grand lady of the seas at night". A similar method was used on the Klingon cruiser model, but he made it less well-lit to convey a different look than the clean visuals of the Federation—the cruiser was meant to evoke "an enemy submarine in World War II that's been out at sea for too long". The models were filmed in multiple passes and composited together in post-production; multiple passes with only the model's lighting running were added to the original pass for the final look. The Klingon cruiser sequence was developed to avoid an opening similar to "Star Wars", with one model used for all three seen in the film.

While Dykstra's team handled the ships, the V'Ger cloud was developed by Trumbull. Trumbull wanted the cloud to have a specific shape to it—"it couldn't just be a blob of cotton," he said, "it had to have some shape that you could get camera angles on." A special camera support track was built that could pan and focus over a piece of art, with the light strobed to provide depth. While the team planned on compositing multiple passes to provide physical movement to the cloud shots, Trumbull felt that it detracted from the sense of scale, and so small animations were subtly introduced in the final product. The torpedo effects were simulated by shooting a laser through a piece of crystal mounted on a rotating rod after experiments with <a href="Tesla%20coil">Tesla coil</a>s proved insufficient. The same effect was recolored and used for the Klingons and the "Enterprise"; the aliens' torpedoes glowed red while the "good guys" had blue-colored weaponry. V'Ger's destruction of the ships was created using scanning lasers, with the multiple laser passes composited onto the moving model to create the final effect.

The scenes of Kirk and Scott approaching the "Enterprise" in drydock spanned two pages of script but took 45 different shots—averaging one a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk to make its flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the "Enterprise", close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.

Dykstra and Apogee created three models to stand in for the Epsilon 9 station. A model was used for distance shots, while an isolated panel was used for closer shots. The station control tower was replicated with rear-projection screens to add the people inside. A 2 ft model spaceman created for the shot was used in the drydock sequence and Spock's spacewalk. Unique destruction effects for the station had to be discarded due to time constraints. V'Ger itself was filmed in a hazy, smoky room, in part to convey depth and also to hide the parts of the ship still under construction. The multiple passes were largely based on guesswork, as every single available camera was in use and the effects had to be generated without the aid of a bluescreen.

Even after the change in effects companies, Yuricich continued to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film, having previously worked on "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20Earth%20Stood%20Still">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>", "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>", "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>" and "<a href="Logan%27s%20Run">Logan's Run</a>". The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the frame was matted out; the blue Earth sky over Yellowstone, for example was replaced with a red-hued Vulcan landscape. More than 100 such paintings were used.

Despite being hired after the completion of nearly all the principal photography, Trumbull had an enormous amount of creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to "2001: A Space Odyssey", provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.

The score for "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" was predominantly written by <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a>, who later composed the scores for "", "", "", and "", as well as the themes to the television series "" (a simplified arrangement of the theme from "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and fronted with <a href="Theme%20from%20Star%20Trek">Alexander Courage's ""Star Trek Fanfare"" intro</a> from ) and "". Gene Roddenberry had originally wanted Goldsmith to score "Star Trek"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s pilot episode, "", but the composer was unavailable. When Wise signed on to direct, Paramount asked the director if he had any objection to using Goldsmith. Wise, who had worked with the composer for "<a href="The%20Sand%20Pebbles%20%28film%29">The Sand Pebbles</a>", replied "Hell, no. He's great!" Wise later considered his work with Goldsmith one of the best relationships he ever had with a composer.

Goldsmith was influenced by the style of the romantic, sweeping <a href="Star%20Wars%20music">music of "Star Wars"</a>. "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of "Star Trek"", he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to rework his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked "Enterprise" by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is the only "Star Trek" film to have a true <a href="Overture%23Film">overture</a>, using "Ilia's Theme" (later re-recorded, as a <a href="Lyrics">lyrical</a> version, by <a href="Shaun%20Cassidy">Shaun Cassidy</a> as "A Star Beyond Time" with lyrics by <a href="Larry%20Kusik">Larry Kusik</a>) in this role, most noticeably in the "Director's Edition" DVD release. "Star Trek" and "<a href="The%20Black%20Hole">The Black Hole</a>" were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a>'s "<a href="Dancer%20in%20the%20Dark">Dancer in the Dark</a>").

Much of the recording equipment used to create the movie's intricately complicated sound effects was, at the time, extremely cutting-edge. Among these pieces of equipment was the ADS ("Advanced Digital Synthesizer") 11, manufactured by <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a> custom synthesizer manufacturer <a href="Con%20Brio%2C%20Inc.">Con Brio, Inc.</a> The movie provided major publicity and was used to advertise the synthesizer, though no price was given. The film's soundtrack also provided a debut for the <a href="Blaster%20Beam">Blaster Beam</a>, an electronic instrument long. It was created by musician <a href="Craig%20Huxley">Craig Huxley</a>, who played a small role in an episode of the original television series. The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum; the device was played with an artillery shell. Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided to use it for V'Ger's cues. Several state-of-the-art synthesizers were used as musical instruments, notably the <a href="Yamaha%20CS-80">Yamaha CS-80</a>, <a href="ARP%202600">ARP 2600</a>, <a href="Oberheim%20OB-X">Oberheim OB-X</a>, and <a href="Serge%20synthesizer">Serge synthesizer</a>. An enormous pipe organ first plays the V'Ger theme on the "Enterprise"s approach, a literal indication of the machine's power.

Goldsmith scored "The Motion Picture" over a period of three to four months, a relatively relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. <a href="Alexander%20Courage">Alexander Courage</a>, composer of the original "Star Trek" theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while <a href="Fred%20Steiner">Fred Steiner</a> wrote 11 cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the "Enterprise" achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.

A soundtrack featuring the film's music was released by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> in 1979 together with the film debut, and was one of Goldsmith's best-selling scores. Sony's <a href="Legacy%20Recordings">Legacy Recordings</a> released an expanded two-disc edition of the soundtrack on November 10, 1998. The album added an additional 21 minutes of music to supplement the original track list, and was resequenced to reflect the story line of the film. The first disc features as much of the score as can fit onto a 78-minute disc, while the second contains "Inside Star Trek", a <a href="spoken%20word">spoken word</a> documentary from the 1970s. In 2012, the score was released yet again via La-La Land Records in association with Sony Music. This 3-CD set contains the complete score for the first time, plus unreleased alternate and unused cues, in addition to the remastered original 1979 album.

The score to "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" went on to garner Goldsmith nominations for the <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscars</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="Saturn%20Awards">Saturn</a> awards. It is often regarded as one of the composer's greatest scores, and was also one of the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s 250 nominated scores for their <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20of%20Film%20Scores">top 25 American film scores</a>.

Sound designer <a href="Frank%20Serafine">Frank Serafine</a>, a longtime "Star Trek" fan, was invited to create the sound effects for the picture. Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.

As all the sound elements such as dubbed lines or background noise came together, they were classified into three divisions: A Effects, B Effects, and C Effects. A Effects were synthesized or acoustic sounds that were important and integral to the picture—the sound of V'Ger's weapon (partly done with the <a href="Blaster%20Beam">Blaster Beam</a> instrument) for example, or Spock's mind meld, as well as transporters, explosions, and the warp speed sound effect. B Effects consisted of minor sounds such as the clicks of switches, beeps or chimes. C Effects were subliminal sounds that set moods—crowd chatter and ambient noise. All the elements were mixed as "predubs" to speed integration into the final sound mix.

When "The Motion Picture" was announced, many synthesizer artists submitted demo tapes to Paramount. Ramsay and Wise consulted and decided that the film should have a unique audio style; they were particularly concerned to avoid sounds that had become pervasive and cliché from repetitive use in other science-fiction movies. Events such as Enterprise bridge viewscreen activation were kept silent to provide a more comfortable atmosphere. In contrast, almost every action on the Klingon bridge made noise to reflect the aliens' harsh aesthetic. While much of the effects were created using digital synthesizers, acoustic recordings were used as well. The wormhole's sucking sounds were created by slowing down and reversing old Paramount stock footage of a cowboy fight, while the warp acceleration "stretch" sound was built on a slowed-down cymbal crash. The crew encountered difficulty in transferring the tapes used for creating the sounds to the 35 mm film used for the final prints; while the film was to be released with <a href="Dolby%20Laboratories">Dolby sound</a>, Serafine found it was easier to mix the sounds without regard to format and add the specific format after, during the later transfer to 35 mm.

According to Michele and <a href="Duncan%20Barrett">Duncan Barrett</a>, Roddenberry had a decidedly negative view of religion that was reflected in the "Star Trek" television series episodes; in the episode "<a href="Who%20Mourns%20for%20Adonais%3F">Who Mourns for Adonais?</a>", for example, the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> is revealed to be a fraud, an alien rather than a divine being from Earth's past. In comparison, religious scholar Ross Kraemer says that Roddenberry "pulled his punches" regarding religion and in the television show religion was not absent but highly private. Barrett suggests that with the "Star Trek" feature films this attitude of not addressing religious issues shifted.

In the television series, little time was spent pondering the fate of the dead. In "The Motion Picture", meanwhile, Decker is apparently killed in merging with V'Ger, but Kirk wonders if they have seen the creation of a new life form. Decker and Ilia are listed as "missing" rather than dead, and the lighting and effects created as a result of the merge have been described as "quasimystical" and "pseudo-religious". The discussion of a new birth is framed in a reverential way. While V'Ger is a machine of near omnipotence, according to Robert Asa, the film (along with its successor, "") "implicitly protest[s] against classical <a href="theism">theism</a>".

To coincide with the film's release, <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a> published a <a href="novelization">novelization</a> written by Roddenberry. The only "Star Trek" novel Roddenberry wrote, the book adds back story and elements that did not appear in the movie; for example, the novelization mentions that <a href="Willard%20Decker">Willard Decker</a> is the son of Commodore <a href="Matt%20Decker">Matt Decker</a> from the original series episode ""—a plot element intended for the "Phase II" television series. The novel also has a different opening scene to introduce "Vejur" and Kirk, concentrates in sections on Kirk's struggle with confidence in taking command of the "Enterprise" again and expands on Ilia and Decker's relationship. The "Vejur" spelling for the "intruder's" name was used exclusively in the novel Roddenberry authored, from its first appearance on page 179 of the first paperback edition of the novelization through to the account on the novel's page 241 of Kirk reading the undamaged "V-G-E-R" letters on the fictional "Voyager 6" space probe's nameplate. In addition to the novel, "Star Trek" printed media included a coloring book, ship blueprints, and a comic book adaptation published by <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> as "<a href="Marvel%20Comics%20Super%20Special">Marvel Super Special</a>" #15 (Dec. 1979). Toys included action figures, ship models, and a variety of watches, phaser mockups and communicators. <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> sold specially designed "Star Trek" <a href="Happy%20Meal">Happy Meal</a>s. The marketing was part of a coordinated approach by Paramount and its parent conglomerate <a href="Gulf%2BWestern">Gulf+Western</a> to create a sustained "Star Trek" product line. started Pocket Books' <a href="Pocket%20Books%20novels%20%28Star%20Trek%29">"Star Trek" book franchise</a>, which produced 18 consecutive bestsellers within a decade.

Owing to the rush to complete the film, "The Motion Picture" was never screened before test audiences, something Wise later regretted. The director carried the fresh print of the film to the world premiere, held at the K-B MacArthur Theater in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Roddenberry, Wise, and the principal cast attended the function, which also served as an invitational benefit for the scholarship and youth education fund of the National Space Club. While thousands of fans were expected to attend, rain reduced fan turnout to around 300. The premiere was followed by a black-tie reception at the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a>. More than 500 people—consisting of the cast and crew, working members of the space community, and the few "hardcore <a href="Trekkie">Trekkie</a>s" who could afford the $100 admission price—filled the museum. The film was the first major Hollywood adaptation of a television series that had been off the air for nearly a decade to retain its original principal cast.

"The Motion Picture" opened in North America on December 7, 1979, in 859 theaters and set a box office record for highest weekend gross, making $11,815,203 in its first weekend (generally considered to be a slow time for the movie business). The film beat the record set by "<a href="Superman%20%281978%20film%29">Superman</a>" (1978), which had opened in a similar number of theaters but had been released in late December—a busier time. "The Motion Picture" earned $17 million within a week. At its widest domestic distribution, the film was shown in 1,002 theaters; it grossed $82,258,456 in the United States, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1979 in that country. Overall, the film grossed $139 million worldwide. "The Motion Picture" was nominated for three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: Best Art Direction (<a href="Harold%20Michelson">Harold Michelson</a>, <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Jennings">Joseph R. Jennings</a>, <a href="Leon%20Harris%20%28art%20director%29">Leon Harris</a>, <a href="John%20Vallone">John Vallone</a> and <a href="Linda%20DeScenna">Linda DeScenna</a>), Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Score.

In the United States, the film sold the most tickets of any film in the franchise until "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" (2009), and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation, but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared to expectations and marketing. "The Motion Picture"s budget of $46 million, including costs incurred during "Phase II" production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. <a href="David%20Gerrold">David Gerrold</a> estimated before its release that the film would have to gross two to three times its budget to be profitable for Paramount. The studio faulted Roddenberry's script rewrites and creative direction for the plodding pace and disappointing gross. While the performance of "The Motion Picture" convinced the studio to back a (cheaper) sequel, Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control. <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> would produce and direct "", which received better reviews (becoming a fan favorite) and continued the franchise. With the successful revival of the "Star Trek" brand on the big screen setting an example, Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material.

"The Motion Picture" met with negative reviews from critics; a 2001 retrospective for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> described the film as a critical failure. As of September 2018, the film holds a 44% rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 36 reviews with the consensus stating: "Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue-heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud, "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is a less-than-auspicious debut for the franchise." Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" felt that the plot was too thin to support the length of the film, although Martin felt that compared to such science-fiction films as "", "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>", "The Motion Picture"s premise was "slightly cleverer". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that "take an unconscionable amount of time to get anywhere, and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way". Livingston also lamented the lack of "boldly characterized" antagonists and battle scenes that made "Star Wars" fun; instead, viewers were presented with lots of talk, "much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon". David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was "no longer surprising and elegant" after films such as "2001: A Space Odyssey", and that much of the action consisted of the crew's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen, which the "New York Magazine" critic considered to be "like watching someone else watch television". "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" disagreed, calling the film "a search-and-destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show's fans thrive on: the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control, troubles with the space ship, the dependable and understanding Kirk, the ever-logical Spock, and suspenseful take with twist ending". Scott Bukatman reviewed "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" in "<a href="Ares%20%28magazine%29">Ares Magazine</a>" #1. Bukatman commented that "With "Star Trek", Roddenberry's trick has been to wear the mask of the humanist as he plays with his Erector set. The scale of the television series arrested his vision at a comfortable and still interesting level, but the new film has finally removed the mask."

The characters and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of "The Globe and Mail" rated their performances highly: "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges are those of an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen "Star Trek" feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." Vincent Canby of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that the actors did not have much to do in the effects-driven film, and were "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> felt the film "teeter[ed] towards being a crashing bore" whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. "[Khambatta] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.

Many critics felt that the special effects overshadowed other elements of the film. Canby wrote that the film "owes more to [Trumbull, Dykstra and Michelson] than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not as impressive as on "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters" due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two-thirds of the way into the film. Kroll, Martin, and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or gloss over its other deficiencies: "I'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co-writers out of the fire", Arnold wrote.

<a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a>, reviewing the film in 1996, felt that the pace dragged and the plot bore too close a resemblance to the original series episode "", but considered the start and end of the film to be strong. Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved "that it was the character-driven play that made all the difference in "Star Trek"". The slow pacing, extended reaction shots, and lack of action scenes led fans and critics to give the film a variety of nicknames, including "The Motionless Picture," "The Slow Motion Picture," "The Motion Sickness," and "Where Nomad" [the probe in "The Changeling"] "Has Gone Before".

The film is recognized by <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> in these lists:

<a href="Paramount%20Home%20Entertainment">Paramount Home Entertainment</a> released the film on <a href="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a>, <a href="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>, and <a href="Capacitance%20Electronic%20Disc">CED</a> <a href="videodisc">videodisc</a> in 1981 in its original theatrical version.

In 1983, an extended cut premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12 minutes to the film. The added footage was largely unfinished, and cobbled together for the network premiere; Wise hadn't wanted some of the footage to be included in the final cut of the film. This version was released on VHS and LaserDisc by Paramount in 1983.

Two members of Wise's production company, David C. Fein and Michael Matessino, approached Wise and Paramount and persuaded them to release a revised version of the film on video; Paramount released the updated "Director's Edition" of the film on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in 2001. Wise, who had considered the theatrical presentation of the film a "rough cut", was given the opportunity to re-edit the film to be more consistent with his original vision. The production team used the original script, surviving sequence storyboards, memos, and the director's recollections. In addition to cuts in some sequences, 90 new and redesigned <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated images</a> were created. Care was taken that the effects meshed seamlessly with the old footage. The edition runs 136 minutes, about four minutes longer than the original release. Included among the special features are the deleted scenes which had been part of the television cut.

Aside from the effects, the soundtrack was remixed. Ambient noise such as the buzz of bridge controls were added to enhance certain scenes. Goldsmith had always suspected that some overly long cues could be shortened, so he made the cues repetitive. Although no new scenes were added, the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA</a> rated the revised edition PG in contrast to the G rating of the original release. Fein attributed the rating change to the more "intense" sound mix that made scenes such as the central part of V'Ger "more menacing".

The Director's Edition was better received by critics than the original theatrical release. The DVD Journal's Mark Bourne said it showcased "a brisker, more attractive version of the movie" that was "as good as it might have been in 1979. Even better maybe." Complaints included the edition's 2.17:1 <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratio</a>, as opposed to the original 2.40:1 <a href="Panavision">Panavision</a>. Jeremy Conrad of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> felt that despite the changes, the pacing might still be too slow for some viewers.

The film's original theatrical cut was released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in May 2009 to coincide with the new "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" feature, packaged with the five following features as the "Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection". "The Motion Picture" was remastered in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="High-definition%20video">high-definition</a>. All six films in the set have 7.1 <a href="Dolby%20TrueHD">Dolby TrueHD</a> audio.

Charles Holden

Charles Henry Holden (12 May 1875 – 1 May 1960) was a <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>-born English architect best known for designing many <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> stations during the 1920s and 1930s, for <a href="Bristol%20Central%20Library">Bristol Central Library</a>, the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a>'s headquarters at <a href="55%20Broadway">55 Broadway</a> and for the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>'s <a href="Senate%20House%20%28University%20of%20London%29">Senate House</a>. He also created many war cemeteries in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and northern <a href="France">France</a> for the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a>.

After working and training in <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Movement">Arts and Crafts Movement</a>, but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and <a href="modern%20architecture">modernist</a>, influenced by European architecture. He was a member of the <a href="Design%20and%20Industries%20Association">Design and Industries Association</a> and the <a href="Art%20Workers%27%20Guild">Art Workers' Guild</a>. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.

Although not without its critics, his architecture is widely appreciated. He was awarded the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>' (RIBA's) <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a <a href="Royal%20Designers%20for%20Industry">Royal Designer for Industry</a> in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a>.

Charles Henry Holden was born on 12 May 1875 at <a href="Great%20Lever">Great Lever</a>, <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>, the fifth and youngest child of Joseph Holden (1842–1918), a <a href="draper">draper</a> and <a href="Hatmaking">milliner</a>, and Ellen (née Broughton, 1841–1890) Holden. Holden's childhood was marred by his father's bankruptcy in 1884 and his mother's death when he was fifteen years old. Following the loss of his father's business, the family moved to <a href="St%20Helens%2C%20Merseyside">St Helens</a> (present-day <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a>), where his father returned to his earlier trade and worked as an <a href="turning">iron turner</a> and <a href="Machinist">fitter</a> and where he attended a number of schools.

He briefly had jobs as a laboratory assistant and a railway clerk in St Helens. During this period he attended <a href="technical%20drawing">draughting</a> classes at the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> and considered a career as an engineer in <a href="Charles%20Douglas%20Fox">Sir Douglas Fox's</a> practice. In 1891 he began working for his brother-in-law, David Frederick Green, a <a href="Civil%20engineering%23Surveying">land surveyor</a> and architect in Bolton. In April 1892 he was <a href="articled%20clerk">articled</a> to Manchester architect Everard W. Leeson and, while training with him, also studied at the <a href="Manchester%20School%20of%20Art">Manchester School of Art</a> (1893–94) and <a href="Manchester%20Technical%20School">Manchester Technical School</a> (1894–96).

While working and studying in Manchester, Holden formed friendships with artist <a href="Muirhead%20Bone">Muirhead Bone</a> and his future brother-in-law <a href="Francis%20Dodd%20%28artist%29">Francis Dodd</a>. About this time Holden was introduced to the writings of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> and became friends with James William Wallace and a number of the members of Bolton's Whitman society known as the "<a href="Eagle%20Street%20College">Eagle Street College</a>". Whitman's writings and those of <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href="Edward%20Carpenter">Edward Carpenter</a> were major influences on Holden's life. He incorporated many of their philosophies and principles into his style of living and method of working.

In 1895 and 1896 Holden submitted designs to "Building News" Designing Club competitions using the pseudonym "The Owl". Although the number of competing submissions made was not always large, from nine competition entries, Holden won five first places, three second places and one third place. In 1897, he entered the competition for the RIBA's prestigious Soane Medallion for student architects. Of fourteen entries, Holden's submission for the competition's subject, a "Provincial Market Hall", came third. Holden described the design as being inspired by the work of <a href="John%20Belcher%20%28architect%29">John Belcher</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Wood">Edgar Wood</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Beresford%20Pite">Arthur Beresford Pite</a>.

Around 1898 Holden began living with Margaret Steadman (née Macdonald, 1865–1954), a nurse and midwife. They were introduced by Holden's older sister, Alice, and became friends through their common interest in Whitman. Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse. Steadman and her husband were never divorced and, though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden referred to her as his wife, the relationship was never formalised, even after James Steadman's death in 1930.

The Holdens lived in suburban <a href="Norbiton">Norbiton</a>, Surrey (now <a href="Royal%20Borough%20of%20Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames</a>) until 1902, when they moved to <a href="Codicote">Codicote</a> in Hertfordshire. Around 1906, they moved to Harmer Green near <a href="Welwyn">Welwyn</a>, where Holden designed a house for them. The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life, described by Janet Ashbee in 1906 as "bananas and brown bread on the table; no hot water; plain living and high thinking and strenuous activity for the betterment of the World". The couple had no children together, though Margaret had a son, Allan, from her marriage. Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green for the rest of their lives.

Holden left Leeson's practice in 1896 and worked for Jonathan Simpson in Bolton in 1896 and 1897, working on house designs there and at <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a>, before moving to London to work for <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Movement">Arts and Crafts</a> designer <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Ashbee">Charles Robert Ashbee</a>. His time with Ashbee was short and, in October 1899, he became chief assistant in <a href="Henry%20Percy%20Adams">H. Percy Adams'</a> practice, where he remained for the rest of his career.

A number of Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' practice specialised in. At this early stage in his career, he produced designs in a variety of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20School">Royal Academy School</a>. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.

His red brick arts and craft façades for the <a href="Belgrave%20Hospital%20for%20Children">Belgrave Hospital for Children</a> in <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, south London (1900–03), were influenced by <a href="Philip%20Webb">Philip Webb</a> and <a href="Henry%20Wilson%20%28architect%20and%20designer%29">Henry Wilson</a> and feature steeply pitched roofs, corner towers and stone window surrounds. The building, now converted to apartments, is <a href="Grade%20II%20listed">Grade II* listed</a>.

In 1902, Holden won the <a href="architectural%20competition">architectural competition</a> to design the <a href="Bristol%20Central%20Library">Bristol Central Library</a>. His <a href="Tudor%20Revival%20architecture">Tudor Revival</a> façades in <a href="bath%20stone">bath stone</a> incorporate <a href="Modern%20architecture">modernist</a> elements complementing the adjacent <a href="Great%20Gatehouse%2C%20Bristol">Abbey Gate</a> of <a href="Bristol%20Cathedral">Bristol Cathedral</a>. The front façade features <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a>s and sculpture groups with <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, <a href="Bede">Bede</a> and <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> by Charles Pibworth. Internally, the design is classical, with the furniture designed by Holden and the stone carving mostly by William Aumonier. It was described by architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as "free Neo-Tudor" and "extremely pretty" and by <a href="Andor%20Harvey%20Gomme">Andor Gomme</a> as "one of the great masterpieces of the early Modern Movement". It has been compared with <a href="Charles%20Rennie%20Mackintosh">Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a>'s <a href="Glasgow%20School%20of%20Art">Glasgow School of Art</a> and it is sometimes suggested that Mackintosh's designs for the later part of the school were inspired by Holden's, although Pevsner noted that Mackintosh's designs were in circulation earlier. The building is Grade I listed.

At <a href="Midhurst">Midhurst</a>, West Sussex, Holden designed Tudor-style façades for the <a href="Ernest%20Cassel">Sir Ernest Cassel</a>-funded King Edward VII Sanatorium (1903–06). The building features long wings of south-facing rooms to maximise patients' exposure to sunlight and fresh air. The design is in keeping with the building's rural setting, with façades in the local tile-hung style. Pevsner called this "certainly one of the best buildings of its date in the country" and "a model of how to build very large institutions". He designed the sanitorium's V-shaped open-air chapel so that it could be used for both outdoor and indoor worship. Both buildings are Grade II listed. Other hospitals he designed in this period include the British Seamen's Hospital in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> (1903–04) and the Women's Hospital in <a href="Soho">Soho</a>, central London (1908).

For <a href="The%20Law%20Society">The Law Society</a> he designed (1902–04) a simplified <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> extension to the existing <a href="Lewis%20Vulliamy">Lewis Vulliamy</a>-designed building in <a href="Chancery%20Lane">Chancery Lane</a> with external sculptures by Charles Pibworth and a panelled arts and crafts interior with carving by William Aumonier and friezes by <a href="Conrad%20Dressler">Conrad Dressler</a>. Pevsner considered the façades to be <a href="Mannerism">Mannerist</a>: "The fashionable term Mannerism can here be used legitimately; for Holden indeed froze up and invalidated current classical <a href="motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a>, which is what Mannerist architects did in the <a href="Cinquecento">Cinquecento</a>."

In 1906, Holden won the architectural competition to design a new headquarters for the <a href="British%20Medical%20Association">British Medical Association</a> on the corner of <a href="Strand%2C%20London">The Strand</a> and Agar Street (now <a href="Embassy%20of%20Zimbabwe%2C%20London">Zimbabwe House</a>). The six-storey L-shaped building replaced a collection of buildings on the site already occupied by the Association and provided it with accommodation for a council chamber, library and offices on the upper floors above space for shops on the ground floor and in the basement. Described by Powers as "classicism reduced to geometric shapes", the first three storeys are clad in grey Cornish granite with <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> above. Located at second floor level was a controversial series of tall sculptures representing the development of science and the ages of man by <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>. The building is Grade II* listed. Alastair Service considered it "perhaps his best London building".

In 1909, Holden won the design competition for an extension to the <a href="Bristol%20Royal%20Infirmary">Bristol Royal Infirmary</a>. Subsequently dedicated to the memory of <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey <a href="loggia">loggia</a>s, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.

The practice became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams, Holden & Pearson when <a href="Lionel%20Pearson">Lionel Pearson</a> became a partner in 1913. In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA's Godwin medal and £65 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Wren-influenced</a> <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20College">Kings College for Women, Kensington</a>. Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> and <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a>, an extension in red brick of <a href="Alfred%20Waterhouse">Alfred Waterhouse</a>'s Shire Hall in <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>, and Arts and Crafts <a href="Sutton%20Valence%20School">Sutton Valence School</a>, Kent.

Holden also worked with Epstein on the tomb of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> at <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20cemetery">Père Lachaise cemetery</a> in Paris (1911–12). In 1915, he was a founding member of the <a href="Design%20and%20Industries%20Association">Design and Industries Association</a> and he was a member of the <a href="Art%20Workers%27%20Guild">Art Workers' Guild</a> from 1917. Unsuccessful competition entries for which he produced designs include Strathclyde Royal Infirmary (1901), <a href="Manchester%20Royal%20Infirmary">Manchester Royal Infirmary</a> (1904), <a href="County%20Hall%2C%20London">County Hall</a> (1907), the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Wales">National Library of Wales</a> (1909), Coventry Town Hall (1911) and the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> building (1915).
The Holdens shared a strong sense of personal duty and service. In the First World War, Margaret Holden joined the "Friends' Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in distress" which helped refugees of those countries stranded in London by the conflict. Charles Holden served with the <a href="British%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>'s London Ambulance Column as a stretcher-bearer transferring wounded troops from London's stations to its hospitals. Holden also served on the fire watch at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> between 1915 and 1917.

On 3 October 1917, Holden was appointed a temporary lieutenant with the army's Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He travelled to the French battlefields for the first time later that month and began planning new cemeteries and expanding existing ones. Holden described his experience:

The country is one vast wilderness, blasted out of recognition where once villages & orchards & fertile land, now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark as far as the eye can reach & dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there singly & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.
In September 1918, Holden transferred to the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (<a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Blomfield">Reginald Blomfield</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Baker">Herbert Baker</a>). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at <a href="Louvencourt">Louvencourt</a> and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on the one at <a href="Forceville">Forceville</a> that was selected as the prototype for all that followed.

In 1920, he was promoted to be the fourth principal architect. His work for the Commission included memorials to the New Zealand missing dead at <a href="Messines%20Ridge%20%28New%20Zealand%29%20Memorial">Messines Ridge British Cemetery</a>, and the <a href="Buttes%20New%20British%20Cemetery%20%28New%20Zealand%29%20Memorial">Buttes New British Cemetery</a> at <a href="Zonnebeke">Zonnebeke</a>. His designs were stripped of ornament, often using simple detailed masses of Portland stone in the construction of the shelters and other architectural elements. Philip Longworth's history of the Commission described Holden's pavilions at Wimereux Communal Cemetery as "almost cruelly severe".

In 1922, Holden designed the War Memorial Gateway for <a href="Clifton%20College">Clifton College</a>, Bristol, using a combination of limestone and <a href="gritstone">gritstone</a> to match the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style of the school's buildings. For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a design for a <a href="Hall%20of%20Remembrance">Hall of Remembrance</a> (1918) that would have been in the form of an art gallery, and for <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, he created a design for a tiny memorial chapel (1919). Neither was constructed.

Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, general manager of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at <a href="Westminster%20tube%20station">Westminster Underground station</a>. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the <a href="British%20Empire%20Exhibition">British Empire Exhibition</a>. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> (now part of the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>) from <a href="Clapham%20Common%20tube%20station">Clapham Common</a> to <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a>. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, <a href="Stanley%20Heaps">Stanley Heaps</a>, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the <a href="London%20Underground%23Roundel">Underground roundel</a> made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at <a href="Bond%20Street%20tube%20station">Bond Street station</a> on the <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a>.

During the later 1920s, Holden designed a series of replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station">Piccadilly Circus</a>, one of the busiest stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious <a href="travertine">travertine</a>-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.

In 1926, Holden began the design of a new headquarters for the UERL at <a href="55%20Broadway">55 Broadway</a> above <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Park%20tube%20station">St. James's Park station</a>. Above the first floor, the <a href="structural%20steel">steel-framed</a> building was constructed to a <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower tall. The arrangement maximises daylight to the building's interior without the use of <a href="light%20well">light well</a>s. Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings, the block is austerely clad in Portland stone. Holden again detailed the façades with commissioned sculptures; , two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s at the seventh floor represent the <a href="Anemoi">four winds</a> (two for each of the <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s, on each side of the projecting wings). The building is Grade I listed.

In 1930, Holden and Pick made a tour of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to see the latest developments in modern architecture. The UERL was planning extensions of the <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> to the west, north-west and north of London, and a new type of station was wanted. Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour, Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms: cylinders, curves and rectangles, built in plain brick, concrete and glass. The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the <a href="District%20line">District line</a> and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original, basic buildings. <a href="Sudbury%20Town%20tube%20station">Sudbury Town</a>, the first station to be rebuilt in 1931, formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed: a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior. The Grade II* listed building was described by Pevsner as "an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be, purely through the use of careful details and good proportions."

For <a href="Arnos%20Grove%20tube%20station">Arnos Grove station</a>, one of eight new stations on the northern extension of the line, Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum, a design inspired by <a href="Gunnar%20Asplund">Gunnar Asplund</a>'s <a href="Stockholm%20Public%20Library">Stockholm Public Library</a>. Also notable on the northern extension is <a href="Southgate%20tube%20station">Southgate station</a>; here Holden designed a single-storey circular building with a canopied flat roof. Above this, the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> windows, supported internally by a single central column. The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball. Other stations show the influence of <a href="Willem%20Marinus%20Dudok">Willem Marinus Dudok</a>'s work in <a href="Hilversum">Hilversum</a>, Netherlands. In order to handle such a large volume of work, Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants, such as Charles Hutton, who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station. For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices. All followed the modern brick, glass and concrete house style defined by Holden, but some lacked Holden's originality and attention to detail; Pick dubbed these "Holdenesque".

The UERL became part of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a> in 1933, but the focus remained on high quality design. Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London's transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to a new type of six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at <a href="Highgate%20tube%20station">Highgate</a>, <a href="East%20Finchley%20tube%20station">East Finchley</a> and <a href="Finchley%20Central%20tube%20station">Finchley Central</a> and new stations at <a href="Elstree%20South%20tube%20station">Elstree South</a> and <a href="Bushey%20Heath%20tube%20station">Bushey Heath</a> for the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>'s <a href="Northern%20Heights">Northern Heights</a> plan. Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: <a href="Dick%20Whittington">Dick Whittington</a> for Highgate, a Roman <a href="centurion">centurion</a> at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the other plans were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station's <a href="air-rights">air-rights</a>, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. <a href="Eric%20Aumonier">Eric Aumonier</a> provided the statue "The Archer", a prominent feature of the station.

Holden's last designs for London Transport were three new stations for the <a href="Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29">Central line</a> extension in north-east London. These were designed in the 1930s, but were also delayed by the war and were not completed until 1947. reduced the quality of the materials used compared with the 1930s stations and the building at <a href="Wanstead%20tube%20station">Wanstead</a> was adapted from a temporary structure constructed during the line's wartime use as an underground factory. <a href="Gants%20Hill%20tube%20station">Gants Hill</a> is accessed through subways and has no station building, but is notable for the design of its platform level concourse, which features a <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a>ed ceiling inspired by stations on the <a href="Moscow%20Metro">Moscow Metro</a>.
After the First World War, the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> needed a replacement for its overcrowded and scattered accommodation in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>. A site was acquired in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> near the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and Holden was commissioned in 1931 to design the new buildings, partly due to the success of 55 Broadway. His original plan was for a single structure covering the whole site, stretching almost from Montague Place to Torrington Street. It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter façade and enclosing a series of courtyards. The scheme was to be topped by two towers: a smaller one to the north, and a 19-storey, tall Senate House.

Construction began in 1932, but due to a shortage of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the <a href="Institute%20of%20Education">Institute of Education</a> and the <a href="School%20of%20Oriental%20and%20African%20Studies">School of Oriental Studies</a> completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.

Senate House divided opinion. Pevsner described its style as "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism", and summarised: "The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations." Others have described it as <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a>, or as <a href="Totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> due to its great scale. <a href="Functionalism%20%28architecture%29">Functionalist</a> architect <a href="Erich%20Mendelsohn">Erich Mendelsohn</a> wrote to Holden in 1938 that he was "very much taken and ... convinced that there is no finer building in London." Historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece." The onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme, although Adams, Holden & Pearson did design further buildings for the university in the vicinity.

With virtually no new work being commissioned, Holden spent the war years planning for the reconstruction that would be required once it was over. Holden was a member of the RIBA's twelve-man committee which formulated the institute's policy for post-war reconstruction. Holden's <a href="Town%20and%20country%20planning%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">town planning</a> ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a> or <a href="Bournville">Bournville</a> where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.

In 1944–45, Holden produced plans for the reconstruction of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, Kent, with the City Architect Herbert Millson Enderby. Canterbury had been badly damaged by <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombing including the <a href="Baedeker%20Blitz">Baedeker raids</a> in May and June 1942. Holden and Enderby aimed to preserve much of the character of the city, but planned for the <a href="eminent%20domain">compulsory purchase</a> of of the town centre for large scale reconstruction including a new civic way from the cathedral to a new town hall. Outside the city, they planned <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypasses</a> and a <a href="ring%20road">ring road</a> at a two-mile (3.2-kilometre) radius of the centre. Although approved by the city council, the plan was widely opposed by residents and <a href="freehold%20%28English%20law%29">freeholders</a> and the "Canterbury Citizens Defence Association" issued an alternative plan before taking control of the council at local elections in November 1945. The change in administration ended the proposals, although a new plan prepared in 1947 without Holden's or Enderby's involvement retained some of their ideas including the ring road.

The <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>'s first reconstruction plan was written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and <a href="William%20Morrison%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dunrossil">William Morrison</a>, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Corporation">City of London Corporation</a> to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that <a href="William%20Holford%2C%20Baron%20Holford">William Holford</a> also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of <a href="Floor%20Area%20Ratio">plot ratio</a> calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, Holden proposed a new <a href="precinct">precinct</a> around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.

In 1947, Holden planned a scheme on behalf of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> for the <a href="South%20Bank">South Bank</a> of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> between County Hall and <a href="Waterloo%20Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</a>, including a plan for a concert hall with the council's architect Edwin Williams. The scheme received little attention and was almost immediately superseded by plans to develop the area as the site of the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>. Holden was also architectural and planning consultant to the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> and to the Borough of <a href="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a>.

Although Charles Holden had gradually reduced his workload, he was still continuing to go into the office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but even then he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.

One of Holden's last public engagements was when he acted as a sponsor at the award of the RIBA's Royal Gold Medal to <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> in 1953. The last project that Holden worked on was a much criticised headquarters building for <a href="English%20Electric">English Electric</a> in <a href="Aldwych">Aldwych</a>, London. In 1952, Adams, Holden & Pearson were appointed by English Electric's chairman, <a href="George%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Nelson%20of%20Stafford">Sir George Nelson</a>, and Holden designed a monolithic stone building around a courtyard. In 1955, the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> persuaded English Electric to put the scheme aside and hold a limited architectural competition for a new design. Adams, Holden & Pearson submitted a design, but were beaten by Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners. When that practice later refused Sir George Nelson's request to redesign the façades, Adams, Holden & Pearson were reappointed and Charles Holden revised his practice's competition entry. The new design was criticised by the <a href="Royal%20Fine%20Art%20Commission">Royal Fine Art Commission</a> and a further redesign was carried out by one of Holden's partners to produce the final design, described by Pevsner as "a dull, lifeless building, stone-faced and with nothing to recommend it".

Holden died on 1 May 1960. His body was cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were spread in the garden of the Friends' Meeting House in <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a>. On 2 June 1960 a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Pancras%20New%20Church">St Pancras New Church</a>, where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and in construction industry periodicals including "<a href="Building%20%28magazine%29">The Builder</a>", "<a href="Architectural%20Review">Architectural Review</a>", "Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects" and "Journal of the Town Planning Institute". Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works. The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.

Holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in "rather a curious position, not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists." He believed that the principal aim of design was to achieve "fitness for purpose", and repeatedly called for a style of architecture that avoided unnecessary architectural adornment.

In 1905, in an essay titled "If Whitman had been an Architect", Holden made an anonymous plea to architects for a new form of modern architecture: "Often I hear of the glory of the architecture of ancient Greece; of the proud Romans; of sombre Egypt; the praise of vast Byzantium and the lofty Middle Ages, too, I hear. But of the glory of the architecture of the Modern I never hear. Come, you Modern Buildings, come! Throw off your mantle of deceits; your cornices, pilasters, mouldings, swags, scrolls; behind them all, behind your dignified proportions, your picturesque groupings, your arts and crafts prettinesses and exaggerated techniques; behind and beyond them all hides the one I love."

In his 1936 speech when presented with the RIBA's <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a>, Holden defined his position: "It was not so much a matter of creating a new style, as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style ... surface embroidery empty of structural significance". His method was to focus on "those more permanent basic factors of architecture, the plan, and the planes and masses arising out of the plan." He described his ideal building as one "which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials. A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work not only to the designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building."

In a 1957 essay on architecture, he wrote "I don't seek for a style, either ancient or modern, I want an architecture which is through and through "good building". A building planned for a specific purpose, constructed in the method and use of materials, old or new, most appropriate to the purpose the building has to serve."

Holden won the RIBA's London Architecture Medal for 1929 (awarded 1931) for 55 Broadway. In 1936 he was awarded the RIBA's <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> for his body of work. He was Vice President of the RIBA from 1935–37 and a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 1933 to 1947. In 1943 he was appointed a <a href="Royal%20Designers%20for%20Industry">Royal Designer for Industry</a> for the design of transport equipment. He was awarded honorary doctorates by <a href="Manchester%20University">Manchester University</a> in 1936 and London University in 1946. Many of Holden's buildings have been granted <a href="listed%20building">listed status</a>, protecting them against demolition and unapproved alteration.

Holden declined the invitation to become a <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academician</a> in 1942, having previously been nominated, but refused because of his connection to Epstein. He twice declined a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a>, in 1943 and 1951, as he considered it to be at odds with his simple lifestyle and considered architecture a collaborative process.

The RIBA holds a collection of Holden's personal papers and material from Adams, Holden & Pearson. The RIBA staged exhibitions of his work at the Heinz Gallery in 1988 and at the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> between October 2010 and February 2011. A <a href="public%20house">public house</a> near <a href="Colliers%20Wood%20tube%20station">Colliers Wood Underground station</a> has been named "The Charles Holden", taking "inspiration" from the architect.

Moe Berg

Morris Berg (March 2, 1902 – May 29, 1972) was an American <a href="catcher">catcher</a> and <a href="coach%20%28baseball%29">coach</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, who later served as a spy for the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Although he played 15 seasons in the major leagues, almost entirely for four <a href="American%20League">American League</a> teams, Berg was never more than an average player, usually used as a backup catcher, and was better known for being "the brainiest guy in baseball" than for anything he accomplished in the game. <a href="Casey%20Stengel">Casey Stengel</a> once described Berg as "the strangest man ever to play baseball".

A graduate of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Law%20School">Columbia Law School</a>, Berg spoke several languages and regularly read 10 newspapers a day. His reputation was fueled by his successful appearances as a contestant on the radio <a href="quiz%20show">quiz show</a> "<a href="Information%2C%20Please">Information, Please</a>", in which he answered questions about the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of words and names from <a href="Attic%20Greek">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, historical events in Europe and the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, and ongoing international conferences.

As a spy working for the government of the United States, Berg traveled to <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> to gather intelligence on <a href="Resistance%20in%20Yugoslavia">resistance groups</a> the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a> was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> <a href="German%20nuclear%20energy%20project">nuclear program</a>. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">OSS's</a> successor, the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.

Berg was the third and last child of Bernard Berg, a pharmacist, and Rose (Tashker), a homemaker, both <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>, who lived in the <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> section of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, a few blocks from the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a> stadium. When Berg was three and a half, he begged his mother to let him start school. In 1906, Bernard Berg bought a pharmacy in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">West Newark</a>. In 1910 the Berg family moved again, to the <a href="Roseville%2C%20Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Roseville</a> section of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg everything he wanted in a neighborhood—good schools, middle-class residents, and very few Jews.

Berg began playing baseball at the age of seven for the Roseville <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> <a href="baseball">baseball</a> team under the less ethnic pseudonym Runt Wolfe. In 1918, at the age of 16, Berg graduated from <a href="Barringer%20High%20School">Barringer High School</a>. During his senior season, the "<a href="Newark%20Star-Ledger">Newark Star-Eagle</a>" selected a nine-man "dream team" for 1918 from the city's best prep and public high school baseball players, and Berg was named the team's <a href="third%20baseman">third baseman</a>. Barringer was the first in a series of institutions Berg joined in his life where his religion made him unusual. Most of the other students were East Side Italian Catholics or Protestants from <a href="Forest%20Hill%2C%20Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Forest Hill</a>, but there were not many Jews, just as Bernard wanted it.

After graduating from Barringer, Berg enrolled in <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and <a href="basketball">basketball</a>. In 1919 he transferred to <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">B.A.</a>, "<a href="Latin%20honors">magna cum laude</a>" in <a href="modern%20language">modern language</a>s. He had studied seven languages: <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Attic%20Greek">Greek</a>, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and <a href="Sanskrit%20language">Sanskrit</a>, studying with the philologist <a href="Harold%20H.%20Bender">Harold H. Bender</a>. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him on the fringes of Princeton society, where he never quite fit in.
During his freshman year, Berg played <a href="first%20baseman">first base</a> on an undefeated team. Beginning in his sophomore year, he was the starting <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>. He was not a great hitter and was a slow baserunner, but he had a strong, accurate throwing arm and sound baseball instincts. In his senior season, he was captain of the team and had a .337 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, batting .611 against Princeton's arch-rivals, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>. Berg and Crossan Cooper, Princeton's <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a>, communicated plays in Latin when there was an opposing player on second base.

On June 26, 1923, Yale defeated Princeton 5–1 at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> to win the <a href="Big%20Three%20%28colleges%29">Big Three</a> title. Berg had an outstanding day, getting two <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> in four <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s (2–4) with a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a> and a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>, and making several marvelous plays at shortstop. Both the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> and the <a href="Brooklyn%20Robins">Brooklyn Robins</a> ("i.e.", Dodgers) desired "Jewish blood" on their teams, to appeal to the large Jewish community in New York, and expressed interest in Berg. The Giants were especially interested, but they already had two future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> at shortstop, <a href="Dave%20Bancroft">Dave "Beauty" Bancroft</a> and <a href="Travis%20Jackson">Travis Jackson</a>. The Robins were a mediocre team, on which Berg would have a better chance to play. On June 27, 1923, Berg signed his first big league contract for $5,000 ($ today) with the Robins.

Berg's first game with the Robins came on June 27, 1923, against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> at the <a href="Baker%20Bowl">Baker Bowl</a>. Berg came in at the start of the seventh inning, replacing <a href="Ivy%20Olson">Ivy Olson</a> at shortstop, when the Robins were winning 13–4. Berg handled five <a href="total%20chances">chances</a> without an <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a>, and caught a <a href="line%20drive">line drive</a> to start a game-ending <a href="double%20play">double play</a>. He got a hit in two at bats, singling up the middle against <a href="Clarence%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Clarence Mitchell</a>, and scoring a <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">run</a>. For the season, Berg batted .187 and made 21 errors in 47 games, his only <a href="National%20League">National League</a> experience.

After the season ended, Berg took his first trip abroad, sailing from New York to Paris. He settled in the <a href="Latin%20Quarter">Latin Quarter</a> in an apartment that overlooked the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a>, where he enrolled in 32 different classes. In Paris he developed a habit he kept for the rest of his life: reading several newspapers daily. Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it "alive" and refused to let anyone else touch it. When he was finished with it, he would consider the paper "dead" and anybody could read it. In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.

During <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> at the Robins facility in <a href="Clearwater%2C%20Florida">Clearwater, Florida</a>, manager <a href="Wilbert%20Robinson">Wilbert Robinson</a> could see that Berg's hitting had not improved, and optioned him to the <a href="Minneapolis%20Millers">Minneapolis Millers</a> of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a>. Berg did not take the demotion well and threatened to quit baseball, but by mid-April he reported to the Millers. Berg did very well once he became the Millers' regular third baseman, hitting close to .330, but in July his average plummeted and he was back on the bench. On August 19, 1924, Berg was lent to the <a href="Toledo%20Mud%20Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a>, a poor team ravaged by injuries. Berg was immediately inserted into the lineup at shortstop when Rabbit Helgeth refused to pay a $10 ($ today) fine for poor play and was suspended. Major league scout <a href="Mike%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28catcher%29">Mike González</a> sent a telegram to the Dodgers evaluating Berg with the curt, but now famous, line, "Good field, no hit." Berg finished the season with a .264 average.

By April 1925, he was starting to show promise as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the <a href="International%20League">International League</a>. Because of his .311 batting average and 124 <a href="run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a>, the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> exercised their option they had with Reading, paying $6,000 ($ today) for him, and moved Berg up to the big leagues the following year.

The 1926 season began with Berg informing the White Sox that he would skip spring training and the first two months of the season to complete his first year at <a href="Columbia%20Law%20School">Columbia Law School</a>, and Berg did not join the White Sox until May 28. <a href="Bill%20Hunnefield">Bill Hunnefield</a> was signed by the White Sox to take Berg's place at shortstop, and was having a very good year, batting over .300. Berg played in only 41 games, batting .221.

Berg returned to Columbia Law School after the season to continue studying for his law degree. Despite White Sox owner <a href="Charles%20Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a> offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox that he would be reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.

Because he reported late, Berg spent the first three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers <a href="Ray%20Schalk">Ray Schalk</a>, <a href="Harry%20McCurdy">Harry McCurdy</a>, and <a href="Buck%20Crouse">Buck Crouse</a> left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher <a href="Frank%20Bruggy">Frank Bruggy</a> to meet the team at their next game, against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher <a href="Ted%20Lyons">Ted Lyons</a> refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.

In Berg's debut as a starting catcher, he had to worry not only about catching Lyons' <a href="knuckleball">knuckleball</a>, but also about facing the Yankees' <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> lineup, which included <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, and <a href="Earle%20Combs">Earle Combs</a>. Lyons beat the Yankees 6–3, holding Ruth hitless. Berg made the defensive play of the game when he caught a poor throw from the outfield, spun and tagged out <a href="Joe%20Dugan">Joe Dugan</a> at the plate. He caught eight more times during the final month and a half of the season.

To prepare for the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> three weeks before reporting to the White Sox spring training facility in <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a>. The hard labor did wonders for him, as he reported to spring training on March 2, 1928, in excellent shape. By the end of the season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher. In 1928, he led all AL catchers in caught-stealing percentage (60.9), was third in the AL in double plays by a catcher, with 8, and fifth in the American League in assists by a catcher, with 52. At the plate, he batted .246 with a career-high 16 doubles.

At law school, Berg failed <a href="Evidence%20%28law%29">Evidence</a> and did not graduate with the class of 1929, but he did pass the New York State <a href="bar%20examination">bar exam</a>. He repeated the evidence course the following year, and on February 26, 1930, received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">LL.B.</a> On April 6, during an exhibition game against the <a href="Little%20Rock%20Travelers">Little Rock Travelers</a>, his spikes caught in the soil as he tried to change directions and he tore a knee ligament. In 1929, he was second in the American League in both double plays by a catcher (12) and assists by a catcher (86), caught the third-most attempted base stealers in the league (41), and was fourth in the league in caught-stealing percentage (47.7%). He had perhaps his best season with the bat, hitting .287 with 47 RBIs.

He was back in the starting lineup on May 23, 1930, but his knee would not allow him to play every day. He played in only 20 games the whole season and finished with a .115 batting average. During the winter, he took a job with the respected <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> law firm Satterlee and Canfield (now Satterlee, Stephens, Burke & Burke). 

The <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> picked him up on April 2, 1931, when Chicago put him on waivers, but he played in only 10 games with 13 at-bats and only 1 hit for the entire season.
The Indians gave him his unconditional release in January 1932, but with catchers hard to come by, <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a>, owner of the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>, invited him to spring training in <a href="Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi">Biloxi, Mississippi</a>. He made the team, playing in 75 games while not committing an error, and was second in the AL in double plays by a catcher, with 9, and in caught-stealing percentage, at 54.3%. When starting catcher <a href="Roy%20Spencer%20%28baseball%29">Roy Spencer</a> went down with an injury, Berg stepped in, throwing out 35 baserunners while batting .236.

Retired ballplayer Herb Hunter arranged for three players, Berg, <a href="Lefty%20O%27Doul">Lefty O'Doul</a>, and Ted Lyons, to go to Japan to teach baseball seminars at Japanese universities during the winter of 1932. On October 22, 1932, the group of three players began their circuit of <a href="Meiji%20University">Meiji</a>, <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda</a>, <a href="Rikkyo%20University">Rikkyo</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Tokyo">Todai (Tokyo Imperial)</a>, <a href="Hosei%20University">Hosei</a>, and <a href="Keio%20University">Keio</a> universities, the members of the <a href="Tokyo%20Big6%20Baseball%20League">Tokyo Big6 Baseball League</a>. When the other Americans returned to the United States after their coaching assignments were over, Berg stayed behind to explore Japan. He went on to tour <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, Shanghai, <a href="Peking">Peking</a>, <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>, <a href="Siam">Siam</a>, India, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and Berlin.

Despite his desire to go back to Japan, Berg reported to the Senators training camp on February 26, 1933, in Biloxi. He played in just 40 games during the season, and batted only .185. The Senators won the pennant, but lost to the Giants in the <a href="1933%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. <a href="Cliff%20Bolton">Cliff Bolton</a>, the Senators' starting catcher in 1933, demanded more money in 1934. When the Senators refused to pay him more, he sat out and Berg got the starting job. On April 22, Berg made an error, his first fielding mistake since 1932—an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games. On July 25, the Senators gave Berg his unconditional release. He soon returned to the big leagues, however, after <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> catcher <a href="Glenn%20Myatt">Glenn Myatt</a> broke his ankle on August 1. Indians manager <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, who had managed Berg in 1932, offered Berg the reserve catching job. Berg played sporadically until <a href="Frankie%20Pytlak">Frankie Pytlak</a>, Cleveland's starting catcher, injured himself, and Berg became the starting catcher.

Herb Hunter arranged for a group of All-Stars, including <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, <a href="Earl%20Averill">Earl Averill</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Gehringer">Charlie Gehringer</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a>, and <a href="Lefty%20Gomez">Lefty Gomez</a>, to <a href="1934%20Japan%20Tour">tour Japan playing exhibitions</a> against a Japanese all-star team. Despite the fact that Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a <a href="16%20mm%20film">16-mm</a> <a href="B%C3%B6we%20Bell%20%26amp%3B%20Howell">Bell & Howell</a> movie camera and a letter from <a href="Movietone%20News">MovietoneNews</a>, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">legislature</a>. 

On November 29, 1934, while the rest of the team was playing in <a href="Omiya%2C%20Saitama">Omiya</a>, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in <a href="Tsukiji">Tsukiji</a>, ostensibly to visit the daughter of American Ambassador <a href="Joseph%20Grew">Joseph Grew</a>. Instead, Berg sneaked onto the roof of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera, providing American intelligence with rare photos of the city. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, Korea, and Moscow.

After his return to America, Berg was picked up by the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. In his five seasons with the Red Sox, Berg averaged fewer than 30 games a season. On February 21, 1939, Berg made his first of three appearances on the radio quiz show, "Information, Please". Berg put on a dazzling performance. Of his appearance, Baseball Commissioner <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> told him, "Berg, in just thirty minutes you did more for baseball than I've done the entire time I've been commissioner". On his third appearance, <a href="Clifton%20Fadiman">Clifton Fadiman</a>, the moderator, started asking Berg too many personal questions. Berg did not answer any more questions and never appeared on the show again. Regular show guest and sportswriter <a href="John%20Kieran">John Kieran</a> later said that "Moe was the most scholarly professional athlete (I) ever knew." After his playing career ended, Berg was a Red Sox coach in 1940 and 1941. Berg punctuated his career in baseball with "Pitchers and Catchers," a widely admired valedictory essay on the meaning and playing of the game, in the September 1941 issue of "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>". A 2018 profile of Berg in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the essay as, "still one of the most insightful works ever penned about the game."

With the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> on December 7, 1941, the United States was thrust into World War II. To do his part for the war effort, Berg accepted a position with <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>'s <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Coordinator%20of%20Inter-American%20Affairs">Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs</a> on January 5, 1942. Nine days later, his father, Bernard, died. During the summer of 1942, Berg screened the footage he shot of Tokyo Bay for intelligence officers of the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States military</a>. The film may have helped <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> plan his famous <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>, although this timeline may be inconsistent, as the Doolittle Raid occurred before summer, on April 18, 1942. 

From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on assignment in the Caribbean and South America. His job was to monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, and they wanted to be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.

On August 2, 1943, Berg accepted a position with the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> Special Operations Branch (SO) for a salary of $3,800 ($ today) a year. He was a paramilitary operations officer in the part of the OSS that is now called the CIA <a href="Special%20Activities%20Division">Special Activities Division</a>. In September, he was assigned to the OSS <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Branch">Secret Intelligence</a> branch (SI), and given a spot on the OSS SI <a href="Balkans%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Balkans</a> desk. In this role, he parachuted into <a href="occupied%20Yugoslavia">occupied Yugoslavia</a> to evaluate the various <a href="resistance%20in%20Yugoslavia">resistance groups</a> operating against the Nazis to determine which was the strongest. He talked to both <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a> and <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Tito</a> and reviewed their forces, deciding that Tito had the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">stronger and better supported group</a>. His evaluations were used to help determine the amount of support and aid to give each group. In late 1943, Berg was assigned to Project Larson, an OSS operation set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects <a href="John%20Shaheen">John Shaheen</a>. The stated purpose of the project was to kidnap Italian <a href="rocket">rocket</a> and <a href="missile">missile</a> specialists in Italy and bring them to the U.S. However, there was another project hidden within Larson, called Project AZUSA, with the goal of interviewing Italian <a href="physics">physicists</a> to see what they knew about <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> and <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20von%20Weizs%C3%A4cker">Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker</a>. It was similar in scope and mission to the <a href="Operation%20Alsos">Alsos</a> project.

From May to mid-December 1944, Berg hopped around Europe interviewing physicists and trying to convince several to leave Europe and work in America. At the beginning of December, news about Heisenberg giving a lecture in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> reached the OSS. Berg was assigned to attend the lecture and determine "if anything Heisenberg said convinced him the Germans were close to a <a href="nuclear%20weapon">bomb</a>." If Berg came to the conclusion that the Germans were close, he had orders to shoot Heisenberg; Berg determined that the Germans were not close. During his time in Switzerland, Berg became close friends with physicist <a href="Paul%20Scherrer">Paul Scherrer</a>. Berg resigned from the OSS in January 1946. “Mr. Morris Berg, United States Civilian, rendered exceptionally meritorious service of high value to the war effort from April 1944 to January 1946,” reads the Medal of Freedom citation. “In a position of responsibility in the European Theater, he exhibited analytical abilities and a keen planning mind. He inspired both respect and constant high level of endeavor on the part of his subordinates which enabled his section to produce studies and analysis vital to the mounting of American operations.” His sister accepted it on his behalf after his death.

In 1951, Berg begged the CIA to send him to Israel. "A Jew must do this", he wrote in his notebook. The CIA rejected Berg's request. Still, in 1952 Berg was hired by the CIA to use his old contacts from World War II to gather information about the <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">Soviet atomic bomb project</a>. For the $10,000 plus expenses that Berg received, the CIA received nothing. The CIA officer who spoke with Berg when he returned from Europe said that he was "flaky".

For the next 20 years, Berg had no real job, living off friends and relatives who put up with him because of his charisma. When they asked what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war, and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave, and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in <a href="Belleville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Belleville, New Jersey</a>, where he remained for the rest of his life.

He received a handful of votes in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> voting (four in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201958">1958</a>, and five in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201960">1960</a>). When he was criticized for "wasting" his intellectual talent on the sport he loved, Berg replied, "I'd rather be a ballplayer than a justice of the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>".

Berg received many requests to write his memoirs, but turned them down. He almost wrote them in 1960, but he quit after the co-writer assigned to work with him confused him with <a href="Moe%20Howard">Moe Howard</a> of the <a href="Three%20Stooges">Three Stooges</a>.

Berg died on May 29, 1972, at the age of 70, from injuries sustained in a fall at home. A nurse at the <a href="Belleville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Belleville, New Jersey</a>, hospital where he died recalled his final words as: "How did the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">Mets</a> do today?" (They won.) His remains were cremated and spread over <a href="Mount%20Scopus">Mount Scopus</a> in Jerusalem, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

Berg was inducted into the <a href="National%20Jewish%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1996, and the <a href="Baseball%20Reliquary">Baseball Reliquary</a>'s Shrine of the Eternals in 2000. His is the only <a href="baseball%20card">baseball card</a> on display at the headquarters of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>.

American actor <a href="Paul%20Rudd">Paul Rudd</a> portrayed Berg in the biographical film "<a href="The%20Catcher%20Was%20a%20Spy%20%28film%29">The Catcher Was a Spy</a>", based on Nicholas Dawidoff's 1994 biography, <a href="The%20Catcher%20Was%20a%20Spy">The Catcher Was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg</a>.

James Bowie

James Bowie ( ; or – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American <a href="American%20pioneer">pioneer</a> and <a href="freemasonry">freemason</a> who played a prominent role in the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, culminating in his death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a>. Stories of him as a fighter and <a href="frontier">frontier</a>sman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in <a href="History%20of%20Texas">Texas history</a> and a <a href="folk%20hero">folk hero</a> of American culture.

Born in <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, Bowie spent most of his life in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the <a href="Sandbar%20Fight">Sandbar Fight</a>. What began as a duel between two other men deteriorated into a mêlée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of <a href="Rapides%20Parish">Rapides Parish</a> with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the <a href="Bowie%20knife">Bowie knife</a>.

Bowie's reputation was cemented by his role in the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. After moving to Texas in 1830, Bowie became a Mexican citizen and married Ursula Veramendi, the daughter of the Mexican vice governor of the province. His fame in Texas grew following his failed expedition to find the lost <a href="San%20Saba%20County%2C%20Texas">San Saba</a> mine, during which his small party repelled an attack by a large Native American raiding party. At the outbreak of the Texas Revolution, Bowie joined the Texas militia, leading forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Battle of Concepción</a> and the <a href="Grass%20Fight">Grass Fight</a>. In January 1836, he arrived at the Alamo, where he commanded the volunteer forces until an illness left him bedridden. Bowie died with the other <a href="Alamo%20defenders">Alamo defenders</a> on March 6. Despite conflicting accounts of the manner of his death, the "most popular, and probably the most accurate" accounts maintain that he died in his bed after emptying his pistols into several Mexican soldiers.

According to his older brother John, James Bowie was born in <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Logan County, Kentucky</a>, on March 10, 1796 (Historical marker: 36° 46' 25"N 86° 42' 10"W). Historian Raymond Thorp gave his birth date as April 10, but Thorp did not provide any documentation for that date. Bowie's surname was pronounced . (Although some works refer to the alternate pronunciation .)

Bowie was the ninth of ten children born to Reason (or Rezin) and Elve Ap-Catesby Jones (or Johns) Bowie. His father had been wounded while fighting in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, and in 1782 married the young woman who had nursed him back to health. The Bowies first settled in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and then moved to <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. At the time of Bowie's birth, his father owned eight <a href="history%20of%20slavery%20in%20Kentucky">slaves</a>, eleven head of cattle, seven horses, and one stud horse. The following year the family acquired along the <a href="Red%20River%20%28Kentucky%20River%29">Red River</a>. They sold that property in 1800 and relocated to <a href="Illinois%20Country">what is now Missouri</a>, before moving to <a href="Spanish%20Louisiana">Spanish Louisiana</a> in 1802, where they settled on Bushley Bayou in what soon became <a href="Rapides%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Rapides Parish</a>.

The family moved again in 1809, settling on <a href="Bayou%20Teche">Bayou Teche</a> in <a href="Territory%20of%20Orleans">Louisiana</a> before finding a permanent home in <a href="Opelousas%2C%20Louisiana">Opelousas</a> in 1812. The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children learned to read and write in English, but James and his elder brother <a href="Rezin%20Bowie">Rezin</a> could also read, write, and speak <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a> fluently. The children learned to survive on the frontier and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and had a reputation for fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Native American friends even taught him to rope alligators.

In response to <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s plea for volunteers to fight the British in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> too late to participate in the fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating them down the bayou for sale. In June 1819, he joined the <a href="Long%20Expedition">Long Expedition</a>, an effort to liberate <a href="Spanish%20Texas">Texas</a> from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.

Shortly before the senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves as well as horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the brothers worked together to develop several large estates in <a href="Lafourche%20Parish">Lafourche Parish</a> and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped to take advantage of its rising land prices through <a href="speculation">speculation</a>. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate <a href="Jean%20Lafitte">Jean Lafitte</a> in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">outlawed the importation of slaves</a>, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on <a href="Galveston%20Island">Galveston Island</a>. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> or areas farther up the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.

In 1825, the two brothers joined with their younger brother Stephen to buy <a href="Acadia%20Plantation">Acadia Plantation</a> near <a href="Thibodaux%2C%20Louisiana">Thibodaux</a>. Within two years, they had established the first steam mill in Louisiana to be used for grinding <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a>. The plantation became known as a model estate, but on February 12, 1831, they sold it and 65 slaves for $90,000. With their profits, James and Rezin bought a plantation in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>.

Bowie and his brother John were involved in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20 years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, <a href="U.S.%20Congress">Congress</a> authorized the <a href="superior%20Court">superior courts</a> of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126 claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.

Bowie became internationally famous as a result of a feud with <a href="Norris%20Wright%20%28sheriff%29">Norris Wright</a>, the sheriff of Rapides Parish. Bowie had supported Wright's opponent in the race for sheriff, and Wright, a bank director, had been instrumental in turning down a Bowie loan application. After a confrontation in Alexandria one afternoon, Wright fired a shot at Bowie, after which Bowie resolved to carry his hunting knife at all times. The knife he carried had a blade that was long and wide.
The following year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright attended a duel on a sandbar outside of <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a>. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither man had been injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie was shot in the hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a <a href="butcher%20knife">butcher knife</a>, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his <a href="Swordstick">sword cane</a> and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.

Newspapers picked up the story, which became known as the <a href="Sandbar%20Fight">Sandbar Fight</a>, and described in detail Bowie's fighting prowess and his unusual knife. Witness accounts agreed that Bowie did not attack first, and the others had focused their attack on Bowie because "they considered him the most dangerous man among their opposition." The incident cemented Bowie's reputation across the South as a superb knife fighter.

There is disagreement among scholars as to whether the knife used in this fight was the same as what is now known as a <a href="Bowie%20knife">Bowie knife</a>, also called an <a href="Arkansas%20toothpick">Arkansas toothpick</a>. Multiple accounts exist of who designed and fabricated the first Bowie knife. Some claim that Bowie designed it, while others attribute the design to noted knife makers of the time. In a letter to "The Planter's Advocate", Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife, however, and many Bowie family members as well, as "most authorities on the Bowie knife tend to believe it was invented by" Rezin. Rezin Bowie's grandchildren, however, claimed that Rezin merely supervised his blacksmith, who was the creator of the knife.

After the Sandbar Fight and subsequent battles in which Bowie used his knife to defend himself, the Bowie knife became very popular. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions, and major cities of the <a href="Old%20Southwest">Old Southwest</a> had "Bowie knife schools" that taught "the art of cut, thrust, and parry." His fame, and that of his knife, spread to England, and by the early 1830s many British manufacturers were producing Bowie knives for shipment to the United States. The design of the knife continued to evolve, but today a Bowie knife generally is considered to have a blade long and wide, with a curved point, a "sharp false edge cut from both sides", and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands.

In 1828, after recovering from wounds suffered in the Sandbar Fight, Bowie decided to move to <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Texas">Coahuila y Texas</a>, at that time a state in the Mexican federation. The <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">1824 Constitution of Mexico</a> banned religions other than <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land. Bowie was baptized into the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the <a href="alcalde">alcalde</a> (chief administrator) of the town, <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Veramendi">Juan Martín de Veramendi</a>, and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro. For the next 18 months, Bowie traveled through Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Louisiana">Alexandria</a>, on September 29, two weeks before they were to be married.

On January 1, 1830, Bowie left Louisiana for permanent residency in Texas. He stopped at Nacogdoches, at Jared E. Groce's farm on the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a>, and in San Felipe, where Bowie presented a letter of introduction to <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> from Thomas F. McKinney, one of the <a href="Old%20Three%20Hundred">Old Three Hundred</a> colonists. On February 20, Bowie took an oath of allegiance to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and then proceeded to <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio de Bexar</a>. At the time, the city was known as Bexar and had a population of 2500, mostly of Mexican descent, and Bowie's fluency in Spanish helped him establish himself in the area. Bowie was elected a commander, with the rank of colonel, of the <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Rangers</a> later that year. Although the Rangers would not be organized officially until 1835, <a href="Stephen%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> had founded the group by employing 30 men to keep the peace and protect the colonists from attacks by hostile <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a>. Other areas assembled similar volunteer militias, and Bowie commanded a group of the volunteers.

Bowie renounced his American citizenship and became a Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills in the state of <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in <a href="Saltillo">Saltillo</a>. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11 <a href="League%20%28unit%29%23Spain">leagues</a> of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000 acres (280,000 ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.

On April 25, 1831, Bowie married nineteen-year-old Maria Ursula de Veramendi, the daughter of his business partner, who had become the vice governor of the province. Several days before the ceremony, he signed a dowry contract promising to pay his new bride 15,000 pesos (approximately $15,000 then, or $ today) in cash or property within two years of the marriage. At the time, Bowie claimed to have a <a href="net%20worth">net worth</a> of $223,000 ($ today), mostly in land of questionable title. Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35. The couple built a house in San Antonio on land Veramendi had given them near the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Missions%20National%20Historical%20Park%23Mission%20San%20Jos%C3%A9">San José Mission</a>. After a short time, however, they moved into the Veramendi Palace, living with Ursula's parents, who supplied them with spending money. The couple had two children, Marie Elve (b. March 20, 1832) and James Veramendi (b. July 18, 1833).

Maria Ursula, her parents, and both children died in September 1833 from <a href="cholera">cholera</a>.

Shortly after his marriage Bowie became fascinated with the story of the "<a href="Lost%20mines">lost</a>" Los Almagres Mine (also known as the lost San Saba Mine and the lost Bowie Mine), said to be northwest of San Antonio near the ruin of the <a href="Mission%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20San%20Sab%C3%A1">Spanish Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba</a>. According to legend, the mine had been operated by local Indians before being seized by the Spanish. After <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexico won independence from Spain</a>, government interest in the mining potential waned. A number of native groups roamed the area, including <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a>, <a href="Lipan%20Apache%20people">Lipan Apache</a>, <a href="Tawakoni">Tawakoni</a>, and <a href="Tonkawa">Tonkawa</a>. Without government troops to keep hostile natives at bay, mining and mineral exploration were impossible. Some believed that after the Mexican citizens left the area, the Lipan took over the mine.

After obtaining permission from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory to search for the legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10 km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and <a href="Waco%20people">Waco</a>, plus another 40 <a href="Caddo">Caddo</a>. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13 hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40 Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing <a href="Mourning%23United%20Kingdom">widow's weeds</a>.

To the surprise of the town, the surviving members of the group returned to San Antonio on December 6. Bowie's report of the expedition, written in Spanish, was printed in several newspapers, further establishing his reputation. He set out again with a larger force the following month, but returned home empty-handed after two and a half months of searching.

Bowie never talked of his exploits despite his increasing fame. Captain William Y. Lacey, who spent eight months living in the wilderness with Bowie, described him as a humble man who never used profanity or vulgarities.

Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress passed a series of laws that seemed to discriminate against Anglo colonists in the province of Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President <a href="Anastasio%20Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a>, <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Mex%C3%ADa">José Antonio Mexía</a>, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.

After hearing that the Mexican army commander in Nacogdoches, José de las Piedras, had demanded that all residents in his area surrender their arms, Bowie cut short a visit to Natchez in July 1832 to return to Texas. On August 2, 1832, he joined a group of other Texans and marched into Nacogdoches to "present their demands" to Piedras. Before the group reached the building housing the town officials, they were attacked by a force of 100 Mexican cavalry. The <a href="Texas">Texans</a> returned fire and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nacogdoches">Battle of Nacogdoches</a> began. After the cavalry retreated, they initiated a siege of the garrison. After a second battle, in which Piedras lost 33 men, the Mexican army evacuated during the night. Bowie and 18 companions ambushed the fleeing army and, after Piedras fled, marched the soldiers back to Nacogdoches. Bowie later served as a delegate to the <a href="Convention%20of%201833">Convention of 1833</a>, which formally requested that Texas become its own state within the Mexican federation.

Several months later, a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic struck Texas. Fearing the disease would reach San Antonio, Bowie sent his pregnant wife and their daughter to the family estate in <a href="Monclova">Monclova</a> in the company of her parents and brother. The cholera epidemic instead struck Monclova, and between September 6 and September 14, Ursula, their children, her brother, and her parents all died of the disease. Bowie, on business in Natchez, heard of his family's deaths in November. From then on, he drank heavily and became "careless in his dress."

The following year, the Mexican government passed new laws allowing land sale in Texas, and Bowie returned to land speculation. He was appointed a land commissioner and tasked with promoting settlement in the area purchased by John T. Mason. His appointment ended in May 1835 when President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> abolished the Coahuila y Tejas government and ordered the arrest of all Texans (including Bowie) doing business in Monclova. Bowie was forced to flee Monclova and return to the Anglo areas of Texas.

The Anglos in Texas began agitating for war against Santa Anna, and Bowie worked with <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a>, the leader of the War Party, to gain support. Bowie visited several Indian villages in East Texas in an attempt to persuade the reluctant tribes to fight against the Mexican government. Santa Anna responded to the rumblings by ordering large numbers of Mexican troops to Texas.

The <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> began on October 2, 1835, with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gonzales">Battle of Gonzales</a>. <a href="Stephen%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> formed an army of 500 men to march on the Mexican forces in San Antonio with the <a href="Come%20and%20take%20it">cannon that had precipitated the fight</a>. The name "<a href="Texian%20Army">Texian Army</a>" sometimes is applied to this militia. On October 22, Austin asked Bowie, now a colonel in the volunteer militia, and <a href="James%20W.%20Fannin">James W. Fannin</a> to scout the area around the missions of <a href="Mission%20San%20Francisco%20de%20la%20Espada">San Francisco de la Espada</a> and <a href="Mission%20San%20Jos%C3%A9%20y%20San%20Miguel%20de%20Aguayo">San José y San Miguel de Aguayo</a> to find supplies for the volunteer forces. The scouting party left with 92 men, many of them members of the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Grays">New Orleans Grays</a> who had just arrived in Texas. After discovering a good defensive position near <a href="Mission%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Pur%C3%ADsima%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20de%20Acu%C3%B1a">Mission Concepción</a>, the group requested that Austin's army join them.

On the foggy morning of October 28, Mexican General <a href="Domingo%20Ugartechea">Domingo Ugartechea</a> led a force of 300 infantry and cavalry soldiers and two small cannons against the Texian forces. Although the Mexican army was able to get within 200 yards (183 m), the Texian defensive position protected them from fire. As the Mexicans stopped to reload their cannon, the Texians climbed a bluff and picked off some of the soldiers. The stalemate ended shortly after Bowie led a charge to seize one of the Mexican cannons, at that time only 80 yards (73 m) away. Ugartechea retreated with his troops, ending the <a href="Battle%20of%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Battle of Concepción</a>. One Texian and ten Mexican troops had been killed. One of the men under Bowie's command during the battle later praised him "as a born leader, never needlessly spending a bullet or imperiling a life, who repeatedly admonished... Keep under cover boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare."

An hour after the battle ended, Austin arrived with the rest of the Texian army to begin a <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of San Antonio de Béxar</a>, where General <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Perfecto%20de%20C%C3%B3s">Martín Perfecto de Cós</a>, the overall commander of Mexican forces in Texas, and his troops were garrisoned. Two days later, Bowie resigned from Austin's army because he did not have an official commission in the army, and he disliked the "minor tasks of scouting and spying".

On November 3, 1835, Texas declared itself an independent state, and a provisional government was formed with <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a> of <a href="Brazoria%2C%20Texas">Brazoria</a> elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his command of the army, and <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> was named army chief. <a href="Edward%20Burleson">Edward Burleson</a> was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.

Houston offered Bowie a commission as an officer on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining that he wanted to be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the <a href="Grass%20Fight">Grass Fight</a> on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187 men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60 mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo. The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.

Shortly after Bowie left San Antonio, <a href="Ben%20Milam">Ben Milam</a> led an assault on the city. In the ensuing fighting, the Texians suffered only a few casualties including Miliam, while the Mexican army lost many troops to death and desertion. Cós surrendered and returned to Mexico, taking with him the last Mexican troops in Texas. Believing the war was over, many of the Texian volunteers left the army and returned to their families. In early January 1836, Bowie went to San Felipe and asked the council to allow him to recruit a regiment. He again was turned down as he "was not an officer of the government nor army."

After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the <a href="Alamo%20Mission%20in%20San%20Antonio">Alamo</a> from the expected attack. He arrived with 30 men on January 19, where they found a force of 104 men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston knew that there were not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, <a href="James%20C.%20Neill">James C. Neill</a>, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and they did not want to destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, <a href="James%20Bonham">James Bonham</a>, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.

Through Bowie's connections because of his marriage and his fluency in Spanish, the predominantly Mexican population of San Antonio often furnished him with information about the movements of the Mexican army. After learning that Santa Anna had 4,500 troops and was heading for the city, Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo, especially "men, money, rifles, and cannon powder". In another letter, to Governor Smith, he reiterated his view that "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the Sabine." The letter to Smith ended, "Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy."

On February 3, <a href="Davy%20Crockett">Davy Crockett</a> appeared with thirty Tennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 11 to visit his sick family, leaving Travis, a member of the regular army, in command. Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel. He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but two days later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.

On February 23, the bells of San Fernando sounded the alarm of the approach of the Mexicans. Travis ordered all the Texan forces into the Alamo. Bowie hurried to gather provisions and herd cattle into the Alamo compound.
Fearing for the safety of his wife's relatives in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and <a href="Juana%20Navarro%20Alsbury">Juana Navarro Alsbury</a>, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to stay inside the walls of the Alamo. Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress. Bowie had been ill, and two doctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">siege of the Alamo</a> on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that <a href="no%20quarter">no quarter</a> would be given.

Bowie and Travis began sending out couriers with pleas for provisions and assistance. Travis sent <a href="Juan%20Seguin">Juan Seguin</a> on Bowie's horse, to recruit reinforcements on February 25, and arrived. On February 26, Crockett reported that Bowie, though suffering from his affliction, continued to crawl from his bed around noon every day and presented himself to the Alamo's inhabitants, which much boosted the morale of his comrades.
Thirty-five years after the Alamo fell, a reporter identified <a href="Moses%20Rose">Louis "Moses" Rose</a> as the only man to have "deserted" the <a href="Texian">Texian</a> forces at the Alamo. According to the reporter's version of Rose's account, when Travis realized that the Mexican army would likely prevail, he drew a line in the sand and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line. At Bowie's request Crockett and several others carried the cot over the line, leaving Rose alone on the other side. After its publication, several other eyewitnesses confirmed the account, but as Rose was deceased the story can only be authenticated by the word of the reporter, who admitted to embellishing other articles, "and thus many historians refuse to believe it."

Bowie perished with the rest of the Alamo defenders on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the <a href="alcalde">alcalde</a> of San Antonio, <a href="Francisco%20Antonio%20Ruiz">Francisco Antonio Ruiz</a>, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.

When Bowie's mother was informed of his death, she calmly stated, "I'll wager no wounds were found in his back." Various eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of Bowie's death. A newspaper article claimed that a Mexican soldier saw Bowie carried from his room on his cot, alive, after the conclusion of the battle. The soldier maintained that Bowie verbally castigated a Mexican officer in fluent Spanish, and the officer ordered Bowie's tongue cut out and his still-breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre. This account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses, and it is thought to have been invented by the reporter. Other witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him, alive, from the room. Various other stories circulated, with some witnesses claiming that Bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. Alcalde Ruiz said that Bowie was found "dead in his bed." According to Wallace O Chariton, the "most popular, and probably the most accurate" version is that Bowie died on his cot, "back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife." One year after the battle, Juan Seguin returned to the Alamo and gathered the remaining ashes from the funeral pyre. He placed these in a coffin inscribed with the names of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. The ashes were interred at the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20San%20Fernando">Cathedral of San Fernando</a>.

Despite his continual pronouncements of wealth, Bowie's estate was found to be very small. His possessions were auctioned for only $99.50. His larger legacy is his position as "one of the legendary characters of the American frontier." Bowie left a "frustratingly sparse paper trail" of his life, and for many "where history failed, the legends prevailed." Although Bowie's name and knife were well known during his lifetime, his legend grew after October 1852, when "<a href="DeBow%27s%20Review">DeBow's Review</a>" published an article written by his brother John Jones Bowie called, "Early Life in the Southwest—The Bowies." The article focused primarily on the exploits of Jim Bowie. Beginning with that article, "romanticized stories" about Bowie began appearing in national press. In many cases, "these stories were pure melodrama, with Bowie rescuing some naïve planter's son or damsel in distress."

Jim Bowie was inducted posthumously into the <a href="Blade%20%28magazine%29">"Blade Magazine"</a> Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 <a href="Blade%20Show">Blade Show</a> in <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, in recognition of the impact that his eponymous design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.

A number of <a href="Legacy%20of%20the%20Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo%23Film">films have depicted the events of the Battle of the Alamo</a>, and Bowie has appeared as a character in each.

From 1956 to 1958, Bowie was the subject of a <a href="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="television%20series">television series</a>, "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Jim%20Bowie">The Adventures of Jim Bowie</a>", which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas. The show, which starred <a href="Scott%20Forbes">Scott Forbes</a> as Jim Bowie, was based on the 1946 novel "Tempered Blade".

Rock star <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, who was born David Robert Hayward-Jones, adopted the folk legend's surname. Jones changed his last name in the 1960s because he feared confusion with <a href="Davy%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Davy Jones</a>, a member of the already famous <a href="The%20Monkees">The Monkees</a>. He chose the Bowie <a href="eponym">eponym</a> because he admired James Bowie and the Bowie knife, although his pronunciation uses the () variant.

<a href="Bowie%20County%2C%20Texas">Bowie County</a> in northeast Texas, and the city of <a href="Bowie%2C%20Texas">Bowie</a> in <a href="Montague%20County%2C%20Texas">Montague County</a>, Texas, were both named in honor of James Bowie. James Bowie Elementary in <a href="Corsicana%2C%20Texas">Corsicana, Texas</a> was also named in honor of James.

Altrincham

Altrincham ( ) is an affluent town in <a href="Trafford">Trafford</a>, Greater Manchester, England, south of the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> southwest of <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a>, southwest of <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a> and east of <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 Census</a>, it had a population of 52,419.

<a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">Historically</a> part of <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, Altrincham was established as a market town in 1290, a time when the economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town. Further <a href="socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> development came with the extension of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of <a href="Dunham%20Massey%20Hall">Dunham Massey Hall</a>, formerly the home of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Stamford">Earl of Stamford</a>, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I <a href="Listed%20Building">Listed Building</a>s and a deer park.

Altrincham today is an affluent suburban <a href="commuter%20town">commuter town</a>, partly because of its transport links. The town has a strong middle-class presence; there has been a steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to <a href="Altrincham%20F.C.">Altrincham F.C.</a> and three ice hockey clubs: <a href="Manchester%20Storm%20%282015%E2%80%93%29">Manchester Storm</a>, <a href="Altrincham%20Aces">Altrincham Aces</a> and Trafford Tornados.

Local evidence of prehistoric human activity exists in the form of two <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> arrowheads found in Altrincham, and further afield, a concentration of artefacts around Dunham. The remains of a <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a>, part of one of the major Roman roads in North West England connecting the legionary fortresses of <a href="Chester">Chester</a> (<a href="Deva%20Victrix">Deva Victrix</a>) and <a href="York">York</a> (<a href="Eboracum">Eboracum</a>), run through the <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Broadheath</a> area. As it shows signs of having been repaired, the road was in use for a considerable period of time. The name Altrincham first appears as "Aldringeham", probably meaning "homestead of Aldhere's people". As recently as the 19th century it was spelt both Altrincham and Altringham.
Until the Normans invaded England, the <a href="manorialism">manors</a> surrounding Altrincham were owned by the Saxon <a href="thegn">thegn</a> Alweard; after the invasion they became the property of <a href="Hamon%20de%20Massey">Hamon de Massey</a>, though Altrincham is not mentioned in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290, when it was granted its <a href="charter">charter</a> as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V. The charter, which exists and is held by Trafford MBC, allowed a weekly market to be held, and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. This suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town, unusual during the Middle Ages, when most communities were agricultural. Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than Dunham – which would have been protected by <a href="Dunham%20Castle">Dunham Castle</a> – because its good access to roads was important for trade.

Altrincham Fair became St James's Fair or Samjam in 1319 and continued until 1895. Fair days had their own <a href="Court%20of%20Piepowders">court of Pye Powder</a> (a corruption of the French for "dusty feet"), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes arising from the day's dealings. By 1348 the town had 120 <a href="burgage%20plots">burgage plots</a> – ownership of land used as a measure of status and importance in an area – putting it on a par with the Cheshire town of <a href="Macclesfield">Macclesfield</a> and above <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a> and <a href="Knutsford">Knutsford</a>. The earliest known residence in Altrincham was ""the Knoll"", on Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. A 1983 excavation on the demolished building, made by <a href="South%20Trafford%20Archaeological%20Group">South Trafford Archaeological Group</a>, discovered evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may have contained a drying kiln or malting floor. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, men from Altrincham fought for the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> <a href="George%20Booth%2C%201st%20Baron%20Delamer">Sir George Booth</a>. During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.

In 1754, a stretch of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was <a href="Turnpike%20trust">turnpiked</a>. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed passengers for the maintenance of the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of <a href="market%20gardening">market gardening</a>, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, the first step in the development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a>.
Moves to connect the town to the UK's railway network gained pace in 1845, when the <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> for the construction of the <a href="Manchester%2C%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a> (MSJAR) was passed. The first train left Altrincham early on 20 July 1849, carrying 65 passengers. The MSJAR had two stations in the town: <a href="Altrincham%20%281st%29%20railway%20station">Altrincham</a>, on Stockport Road, and <a href="Bowdon%20railway%20station">Bowdon</a> – though not actually in <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a> – on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 by <a href="Altrincham%20Interchange">Altrincham & Bowdon railway station</a> on Stamford New Road. The <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s station at Broadheath, on the town's northern edge, was opened in 1854, while a further connection was created on 12 May 1862 by the <a href="Cheshire%20Midland%20Railway">Cheshire Midland Railway</a> (later the <a href="Cheshire%20Lines%20Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee</a>), who opened their line from Altrincham to Knutsford.

With its new railway links, Altrincham and the surrounding areas became desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live. Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. While some travelled daily by coach, the less well–to–do commuted by express or "flyer" <a href="barge">barge</a>s from Broadheath. Between 1851 and 1881 the population increased from 4,488 to 11,250. Broadheath's industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by <a href="Harry%20Grey%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford</a>, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, cameras and grinding machines. The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14 companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the <a href="Budenberg%20Gauge%20Company">Budenberg Gauge Company</a>. Linotype also created 172 workers' homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased by 35 per cent, from 12,440 to 16,831.

From the turn of the 20th century to the start of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>'s raids on the Manchester area in the latter war, it emerged from the war relatively unscathed having lost only 23 civilian residents through enemy action, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40 per cent.

Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a <a href="charter">charter</a> in June 1290 by the <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">Lord of the Manor</a>, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's <a href="burgess%20%28word%29">burgesses</a> to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a <a href="Court%20Leet">Court Leet</a> and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.

The borough was not one of those reformed by the <a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835">Municipal Corporations Act of 1835</a>, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its <a href="Unreformed%20boroughs%20in%20England%20and%20Wales%201835%E2%80%931886">final abolition</a> in 1886. The <a href="Local%20board%20of%20health">Public Health Act of 1848</a> led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.

The local board was reconstituted as an <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> council in the <a href="administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201894">Local Government Act 1894</a>. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of <a href="Carrington%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Carrington</a> and <a href="Dunham%20Massey">Dunham Massey</a> Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; <a href="Timperley">Timperley Civil Parish</a> was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with <a href="Hale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hale Urban District</a>; a minor addition from <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon Urban District</a>; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a <a href="royal%20charter">charter of incorporation</a> and became a <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a>. The new borough was granted <a href="coat%20of%20arms">armorial bearings</a> which featured <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough">Metropolitan Borough</a> of <a href="Trafford">Trafford</a> in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.

Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education, social services, town planning, waste collection and <a href="council%20housing">council housing</a>. The area is divided into seven electoral <a href="ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a>: <a href="Altrincham%20%28ward%29">Altrincham</a>, <a href="Bowdon%20%28ward%29">Bowdon</a>, <a href="Broadheath%20%28ward%29">Broadheath</a>, <a href="Hale%20Barns%20%28ward%29">Hale Barns</a>, <a href="Hale%20Central">Hale Central</a>, <a href="Timperley%20%28ward%29">Timperley</a>, and <a href="Village%20%28ward%29">Village</a>. These wards have 21 out of the 63 seats on the Trafford Council; as of the <a href="Trafford%20Council%20election%2C%202014">2014 local elections</a> fifteen of these seats were held by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, three by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, and three by the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a>. Altrincham was in the <a href="Altrincham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">eponymous parliamentary constituency</a> which was created in 1885. This lasted until 1945 when it was replaced by Altrincham and Sale. In 1997, this in turn became part of the newly created constituency of <a href="Altrincham%20and%20Sale%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Altrincham and Sale West</a>. Since its formation, Altrincham and Sale West has been represented in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative MP</a>, <a href="Graham%20Brady">Graham Brady</a>. This is one of only four Conservative <a href="List%20of%20Parliamentary%20constituencies%20and%20Members%20of%20Parliament%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">seats in Greater Manchester</a>.

At (53.3838, −2.3547), Altrincham is on the southwestern edge of the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Urban%20Area">Greater Manchester Urban Area</a>, immediately south of the town of <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a>, and southwest of Manchester city centre. It lies in the northwest corner of the <a href="Cheshire%20Plain">Cheshire Plain</a>, just south of the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>. The <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> passes through the <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Broadheath</a> area of the town. Altrincham's drinking water is supplied by <a href="United%20Utilities">United Utilities</a>. The local bedrock consists mainly of Keuper Waterstone, a type of sandstone, and water retrieved from those rocks is very hard and often saline, making it undrinkable. The town's climate is generally <a href="temperate">temperate</a>, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom; whereas both annual rainfall and average hours of sunshine are slightly below the average for the UK.

Along with Sale, <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a> and <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a>, Altrincham is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford. The Altrincham area, as defined by Trafford Council, comprises the south of Trafford. In addition to the town of Altrincham, it includes the villages of <a href="Timperley">Timperley</a>, <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a>, <a href="Hale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hale</a> and <a href="Hale%20Barns">Hale Barns</a>. The Broadheath area of the town was a light industrial centre until the 1970s and is now a retail park. The most densely populated part of the town is around the town centre, with the less populated areas and more green space further from the centre of town in villages such as Bowdon and Hale. The <a href="Oldfield%20Brow">Oldfield Brow</a> area lies on the outskirts of the town beside the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> and close to <a href="Dunham%20Massey">Dunham Massey</a>.

As of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 UK census</a>, the town of Altrincham had a total population of 52,419. Of its 41,530 residents aged 16 and over, 62.1 per cent were couples living together.
The town's population density is 37.4 inhabitants per hectare, with the population consisting of 49.0% males and 51.0% females. Of those aged 16 and over, 15.2 per cent had no <a href="Education%20in%20England%23Specialist%20qualifications">academic qualifications</a>, similar to the 18.6 per cent in all of Trafford. At 8.4 percent, Altrincham has a low proportion of non-white people. Asians are the area's largest ethnic minority, at 4.9 per cent of the population.

In 1931, 14.6 per cent of Altrincham's population was middle class, slightly higher than the figure for England and Wales, which was 14 per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8 per cent compared to 24 per cent nationally, while the town's working class population had declined, from 30.3 per cent in 1931 (36 per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6 per cent (26 per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure was similar to that seen across the nation – although biased towards the middle classes – making Altrincham the middle-class town it is today.

According to the <a href="hearth%20tax">hearth tax</a> returns from 1664, the township of Altrincham had a population of about 636, making it the largest of the local settlements; this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In the first half of the 19th century, the town's population increased by 165 per cent, higher than 89 per cent across England and 98 per cent in the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>, <a href="Hyde%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hyde</a>, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham's population grew by 275 per cent, higher than the 235 per cent for Trafford and 69 per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the <a href="late%20industrialisation">late industrialisation</a> of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.

Historically, Altrincham was a <a href="market%20town">market town</a> and the two main areas of employment were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the mid-19th century and the market still continues. During the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Broadheath</a> area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four cotton mills in Altrincham, part of its textile industry, although they had closed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%201851">1851 census</a>. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham mirrored the decline of the industry in the Trafford area as a result of a lack of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>, and <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 and 1970. Despite the presence of retailers such as <a href="Tesco">Tesco</a>, <a href="Sainsbury%27s">Sainsbury's</a> and <a href="Marks%20%26amp%3B%20Spencer">Marks & Spencer</a> in the town, a new <a href="Asda">Asda</a> superstore in Broadheath, and redevelopment schemes costing over £100 million, Altrincham's 15.5 per cent level of employment in retail is below the national average of 16.9 per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a> and <a href="Hale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hale</a>, is said to constitute a "stockbroker belt", with well-appointed dwellings in an area of <a href="wikt%3Asylvan">sylvan</a> opulence.

The historic market town developed as a residential area in the 19th century although it retains its retail heritage in the Old Market Place (a <a href="conservation%20area">conservation area</a>) and a new pedestrianised shopping centre. The retail districts of the town have more recently fallen victim to decline due to competition from the nearby <a href="Trafford%20Centre">Trafford Centre</a> and a regenerated Manchester city centre. In 2006 Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council unveiled plans for a £1.5 million redevelopment for the town centre. The renovation will create of new retail space and of refurbished space, providing in total.

Construction on Altair, a £100 million development on Oakfield Road, is expected to begin in 2013(still not started as at Oct 2018). The scheme includes a hotel, offices, shops and eating places, and is expected to create 2,000 permanent jobs. A further £20 million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby <a href="Altrincham%20Interchange">Altrincham Interchange</a>. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, nearly a third of the shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the <a href="Late-2000s%20recession">recession</a> and plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.

According to the 2011 UK census, the main industries of employment of residents in Altrincham were wholesale and retail trade (14.8%), human health and social work activities (13.0%), and professional, scientific and technical activities (11.6%). The census recorded the economic inactivity of residents aged 16–74 as 3.5 per cent looking after home or family, 2.8 per cent long-term sick or disabled, 4.1 per cent students, and 1.5 per cent economically inactive for other reasons. The 3.1 per cent unemployment rate of Altrincham was low compared with the national rate of 4.4 per cent.

The Old Market Place is thought to stand on the site of the original town settlement. Now a registered <a href="conservation%20area">conservation area</a> it consists of a series of part <a href="timber%20framing">timber-framed</a> buildings echoing the <a href="wattle%20and%20daub">wattle and daub</a>e constructions of the original houses and <a href="burgage">burgage</a> plots. The cobblestone paving was replaced in 1896. The Buttermarket which stood in the area near the Old Market Place from the 17th century until the late 19th century was also the site for dispensing early local justice. A courtroom, <a href="stocks">stocks</a> and <a href="Pillory">whipping post</a> saw public floggings take place there until the early 19th century. The whipping post and stocks were restored as a tourist attraction by local traders in the 1990s. However the Buttermarket area was also a site of religious importance, since prospective brides and grooms are thought to have declared their intentions here. In 1814 <a href="Thomas%20de%20Quincey">Thomas de Quincey</a> described the Old Market Place in his "<a href="Confessions%20of%20an%20English%20Opium%20Eater">Confessions of an English Opium Eater</a>" while travelling from Manchester to Chester. He noted how little the place had changed since his visit 14 years earlier at the age of three, and that "fruits, such as can be had in July, and flowers were scattered about in profusion: even the stalls of the butchers, from their brilliant cleanliness, appeared attractive: and bonny young women of Altrincham were all tripping about in caps and aprons coquettishly disposed" In 1974 Altrincham artist George Allen was approached by Trafford Council to paint a picture of The Old Market Place .This picture was used to produce postcards which were sold to promote Altrincham, and are still sold today to raise funds for a local charity.
Another of Altrincham's attractions is the historic <a href="market%20%28place%29">market</a>, set up over 700 years ago when the town was first established.
Of the 21 conservation areas in Trafford, ten are in Altrincham: The Downs, The Devisdale, Bowdon, Ashley Heath, Goose Green, Old Market Place, Sandiway, George Street, the Linotype Housing Estate and Stamford New Road. On the town's outskirts is the 18th-century <a href="Dunham%20Massey">Dunham Massey Hall</a>, surrounded by its deer park, both now owned by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>. The hall is early <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> in style, and along with its stables and carriage house, is a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>.

<a href="Royd%20House">Royd House</a> was built between 1914 and 1916, by local architect <a href="Edgar%20Wood">Edgar Wood</a>, as his own residence. It has a flat concrete roof, a concave façade, and is faced in Portland red stone and Lancashire brick. It is regarded as one of the most advanced examples of early 20th-century domestic architecture, and is referenced in architectural digests. It has been a Grade I listed building since 1975, one of six such buildings in Trafford. The Grade II listed clock outside the main transport interchange was built in 1880.

The Stamford Park was designed by landscape gardener John Shaw. It opened to the public in 1880, as a sports park with areas for cricket and football. The land was donated by <a href="George%20Grey%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">George Grey</a>, the 7th <a href="Earl%20of%20Stamford">Earl of Stamford</a>, and is now owned and run by Trafford Council. The park is listed as Grade II on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens">Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England</a>, and has won a bronze award from the Greenspace award scheme.

Altrincham has its own music festival that takes place in August. The Goose Green Festival takes place over the August bank holiday weekend in the Goose Green area of Altrincham, and features a number of unsigned bands, local food and drink and entertainment for all the family. Founded in 2015, the two day festival attracts over 6000 visitors over the two days, and headline acts have included Prose, The Jade Assembly, The Rainband, Apollo Junction and Corella.
Altrincham has two theatres, the <a href="Altrincham%20Garrick%20Playhouse">Altrincham Garrick Playhouse</a> and the Club Theatre (latterly known as the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the world stage premier of "<a href="Psycho%20%28novel%29">Psycho</a>" in 1982. In 1998, it received a grant of £675,000 from the <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a> as part of a £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also had Greater Manchester's only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.

<a href="Altrincham%20F.C.">Altrincham F.C.</a>, nicknamed "The Robins", were founded in 1903 and play home matches at <a href="Moss%20Lane">Moss Lane</a>. The club plays in the <a href="National%20League%20North">National League North</a>. In the 1970s and 1980s Altrincham F.C. built a reputation for "<a href="wikt%3Agiant-killing">giant-killing</a>" acts against Football League teams in <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> matches. The club has knocked out Football League opposition on a record 16 occasions, including a <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20FA%20Cup">1986</a> victory against top-flight <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. Altrincham won the forerunner of the Football Conference in its first two seasons, but was denied election to <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> on both occasions, falling a single vote short in 1980. Altrincham have since had mixed fortunes. Relegated to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Football%20Conference">1997</a>, the club <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Northern%20Premier%20League">earned promotion</a> two years later, but suffered a second relegation after a <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Football%20Conference">single season</a> in the Conference. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Football%20Conference">2010–11 season</a> Altrincham were relegated to Conference North.

Altrincham is one of the few towns in North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Broadheath</a>. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until construction of the 2,500 capacity <a href="Altrincham%20Ice%20Dome">Altrincham Ice Dome</a> was completed. <a href="Manchester%20Phoenix">Manchester Phoenix</a>, a club having a professional presence in the <a href="English%20Premier%20Ice%20Hockey%20League">English Premier Ice Hockey League</a> and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's <a href="MEN%20Arena">MEN Arena</a>. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix <a href="English%20National%20Ice%20Hockey%20League">English National Ice Hockey League</a> team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.

Seamons Cycling Club was formed in 1948 in the area of Altrincham known locally as Seamons Moss.

As Altrincham was part of the Bowdon parish, children from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40 boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9 schools, 1 college, and 23 teachers. The introduction of compulsory education during the second half of the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12 church schools and 8 private schools.

Responsibility for local education fell to <a href="Cheshire%20County%20Council">Cheshire County Council</a> in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively. Although still open these schools have since changed their names to <a href="Altrincham%20Grammar%20School%20for%20Girls">Altrincham Grammar School for Girls</a>, <a href="Altrincham%20Grammar%20School%20for%20Boys">Altrincham Grammar School for Boys</a>, and <a href="Loreto%20Grammar%20School">Loreto Grammar School</a>. Altrincham received evacuees during the Second World War, and it was in this period that <a href="St.%20Ambrose%20College">St. Ambrose College</a> was founded.

Altrincham now has eighteen primary schools, one <a href="special%20school">special school</a> and eight secondary schools, including five <a href="Grammar%20schools%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">grammar schools</a>; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system assessed by entrance exams set by each school. Several of Altrincham's secondary schools have <a href="specialist%20school">specialist status</a>: <a href="Altrincham%20College%20of%20Arts">Altrincham College of Arts</a> (<a href="Arts%20College">arts</a>); Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (<a href="Language%20College">language</a>); Altrincham Grammar School for Girls (language); <a href="Blessed%20Thomas%20Holford%20Catholic%20College">Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College</a> (<a href="Mathematics%20and%20Computing%20College">maths and computing</a>); Loreto Grammar School (<a href="Science%20College">science</a> and maths); and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing). Altrincham College of Arts, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College, Loreto Grammar School, and St. Ambrose College were all rated as outstanding in their most recent <a href="Ofsted">Ofsted</a> reports. <a href="Brentwood%20Special%20School">Brentwood Special School</a> is a mixed school for 11- to 19-year-olds who have special needs or learning difficulties.

During the medieval and post-medieval periods the township of Altrincham was part of Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town did not have a church until the <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> church established a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a> in 1799. <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a>s were also present in Altrincham; <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a> set up a chapel in 1790, and <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> built one in the 1870s. Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s also returned <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> to the area, the first <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.

Several churches in Altrincham are deemed architecturally important enough to be designated Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed</a> buildings. These are Christ Church, the <a href="St%20Alban%27s%20Church%2C%20Broadheath">Church of St Alban</a>, the <a href="St%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Altrincham">Church of St George</a>, the Church of St John the Evangelist and Trinity United Reformed Church. Of the nine Grade II* listed buildings in Trafford, three are in Altrincham: the Church of St Margaret, the Church of St John the Divine and Hale Chapel in <a href="Hale%20Barns">Hale Barns</a>. As of the 2001 UK census, 78.8 per cent of Altrincham's residents reported themselves as being Christian, 1.1 per cent Jewish, 1.1 per cent Muslim, 0.4 per cent Hindu, 0.2 per cent Buddhist and 0.1 per cent Sikh. The census recorded 12.1 per cent as having no religion, 0.2 per cent with an alternative religion, while 6.1 per cent did not state a religion. Altrincham is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and the Church of England Diocese of Chester. The nearest synagogue, belonging to Hale and District Hebrew Congregation, is on Shay Lane in Hale Barns.

Construction of the <a href="Manchester%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a> began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from <a href="Manchester%20Piccadilly%20railway%20station">Manchester London Road</a> via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrified</a> railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC <a href="Overhead%20lines">overhead line</a>. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> light rail system. <a href="Broadheath%20railway%20station">Broadheath railway station</a> served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.

<a href="Altrincham%20Interchange">Altrincham Interchange</a> is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area.

Leg before wicket

Leg before wicket (lbw) is one of the ways in which a <a href="batsman">batsman</a> can be <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissed</a> in the sport of <a href="cricket">cricket</a>. Following an <a href="Appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a> by the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielding side</a>, the <a href="umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpire</a> may rule a batsman out lbw if the <a href="cricket%20ball">ball</a> would have struck the <a href="wicket">wicket</a>, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the <a href="cricket%20bat">bat</a>). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.

Leg before wicket first appeared in the <a href="laws%20of%20cricket">laws of cricket</a> in 1774, as batsmen began to use their <a href="Pads%23Batting">pads</a> to prevent the ball hitting their wicket. Over several years, refinements were made to clarify where the ball should pitch and to remove the element of interpreting the batsman's intentions. The 1839 version of the law used a wording that remained in place for nearly 100 years. However, from the latter part of the 19th century, batsmen became increasingly expert at "pad-play" to reduce the risk of their dismissal. Following a number of failed proposals for reform, in 1935 the law was expanded, such that batsmen could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29">off stump</a>. Critics felt this change made the game unattractive as it encouraged negative tactics at the expense of <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowling.

After considerable debate and various experiments, the law was changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, which is used to this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.

In his 1995 survey of cricket laws, <a href="Gerald%20Brodribb">Gerald Brodribb</a> states: "No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days". Owing to its complexity, the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators, administrators and commentators; lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble. Since the law's introduction, the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years. Statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing.

The definition of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the <a href="Laws%20of%20Cricket">Laws of Cricket</a>, written by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must <a href="Appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a> to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a> — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must <a href="Cricket%20pitch%23Related%20usages">pitch</a> in line with or on the off side of the <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his <a href="Cricket%20bat">bat</a>, in line with the wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.

A batsman can be out lbw even if the ball did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw, although this situation is extremely rare. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), even if the ball would have otherwise hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted to hit the ball with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the <a href="switch%20hit">switch hit</a> or <a href="reverse%20sweep">reverse sweep</a>, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.
According to MCC guidelines for umpires, factors to consider when giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was <a href="Swing%20bowling">swinging</a> through the air. He must also account for the height of the ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.

The earliest known written version of the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does not include an lbw rule. At the time, batsmen in English cricket used curved bats, which made it unlikely that they would be able to stand directly in front of the wickets. However, a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was "standing unfair to strike". Cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years, allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen. The 1788 version of the laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman's intent; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that "pitch[ed] straight". Further clarification of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that "the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket". The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.

In essence, the lbw law remained the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in <a href="County%20Championship">county cricket</a> began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their <a href="Cricket%20clothing%20and%20equipment">pads</a> only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur cricketers</a> did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. <a href="Arthur%20Shrewsbury">Arthur Shrewsbury</a> was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.

Several proposals were made to prevent pad-play. At a meeting of representatives of the main county cricket clubs in 1888, one representative expressed the opinion that a "batsman who defended his wicket with his body instead of with his bat should be punished". The representatives supported a motion to alter the law to state that the batsman would be out if he stopped a ball that would have hit the wicket; in contrast to the existing wording, this took no account of where the ball pitched relative to the wickets. Further proposals included one in which the intent of the batsman was taken into account, but no laws were changed and the MCC merely issued a condemnation of the practice of using pads for defence. This reduced pad-play for a short time, but when it increased again, a second pronouncement by the MCC had little effect.

Further discussion on altering the law took place in 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, <a href="Alfred%20Lyttelton">Alfred Lyttelton</a> formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. <a href="A.%20G.%20Steel">A. G. Steel</a> was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed it would make the task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton's brother, <a href="Robert%20Lyttelton">Robert</a>, supported the alteration and campaigned for the rest of his life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the <a href="Minor%20Counties%20Cricket%20Championship">Minor Counties Championship</a>, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.

Between 1900 and the 1930s, the number of runs scored by batsmen, and the proportion of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play and the extent to which batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.
To address the problem, and redress the balance for bowlers, the MCC made some alterations to the laws. The size of the ball was reduced in 1927, and that of the stumps increased in 1931, but the changes had little effect. Between 1929 and 1933, county authorities conducted a trial in which a batsman could be lbw if he had hit the ball onto his pads. Then, in 1935, an experimental law was introduced in which the batsman could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump—in other words, a ball that turned or swung into the batsman but did not pitch in line with the wickets. However, the ball was still required to strike the batsman in line with the wickets. The umpire signalled to the scorers when he declared a batsman out under the new rule, and any such dismissal was designated "lbw (n)" on the scorecard.

Several leading batsmen opposed the new law, including the professional <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>, known as an exponent of pad-play, and amateurs <a href="Errol%20Holmes">Errol Holmes</a> and <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a>. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" noted that these three improved their batting records during the 1935 season, but batsmen generally were less successful. There were also fewer drawn matches. There was an increase in the number of lbws— out of 1,560 lbw dismissals in first-class matches in 1935, 483 were given under the amended law. "Wisden" judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season; batsmen soon became accustomed to the alteration. Although Australian authorities were less convinced, and did not immediately introduce the revision into domestic first-class cricket, in 1937 the new rule became part of the Laws of Cricket.

According to <a href="Gerald%20Brodribb">Gerald Brodribb</a>, in his survey and history of the Laws, the change produced more "enterprising", exciting cricket but any alteration in outlook was halted by the Second World War. When the sport resumed in 1946, batsmen were out of practice and the amended lbw law played into the hands of <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> and <a href="Inswinger">inswing</a> bowlers, who began to dominate county cricket. The cricket historian Derek Birley notes that many of these bowlers imitated the methods of <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, an inswing bowler who was successful immediately after the war, but that the resulting cricket was unexciting to watch. The revised lbw law, and other alterations in the game in favour of the bowler, further encouraged such bowling. The new law continued to provoke debate among writers and cricketers; many former players claimed that the alteration had caused a deterioration in batting and reduced the number of shots played on the off side. A 1963 report in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" blamed the law for reducing the variety of bowling styles: "the change has led to a steady increase in the amount of seam and off-spin bowling. Whereas in the early thirties every county had a leg spinner and an orthodox left arm spinner, leg spinners, at any rate, are now few and far between. Walk on to any of the first-class grounds at any time tomorrow and the chances are that you will see the wicketkeeper standing back and a medium pace bowler in action ... there is little doubt that the game, as a spectacle, is less attractive than it was." Several critics, including Bob Wyatt, maintained that the lbw law should be returned to its pre-1935 wording; he campaigned to do so until his death in 1995. On the other hand, Bradman, in the 1950s, proposed extending the law so that batsmen could be lbw even if they were struck outside the line of off stump. An MCC study of the state of cricket, carried out in 1956 and 1957, examined the prevalent and unpopular tactic involving off-spin and inswing bowlers aiming at leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side. Rather than alter the lbw law to combat the problem, the MCC reduced the number of fielders allowed on the leg side.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the amount of pad-play increased, owing to more difficult and unpredictable pitches that made batting much harder. Critics continued to regard this tactic as "negative and unfair". In an effort to discourage pad-play and encourage <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowling, a new variant of the lbw law was introduced, initially in Australia and the West Indies in the 1969–70 season, then in England for 1970. Under the re-worded law, a batsman would be lbw if a ball destined to hit the stumps pitched in line with the wickets or "outside a batsman's off stump and in the opinion of the umpire he made no genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat". This revision omitted the requirement that the impact should be in line with the wickets, but meant that any batsman playing a shot could not be out if the ball pitched outside off stump, in contrast to the 1935 law. The editor of "Wisden" believed the change encouraged batsmen to take more risks, and had produced more attractive cricket. However, the proportion of wickets falling lbw sharply declined, and concerns were expressed in Australia. The Australian authorities proposed a reversion to the previous law. A batsman could once more be out to a ball that pitched outside off stump, but a provision was added that "if no stroke is offered to a ball pitching outside the off-stump which in the opinion of the umpire would hit the stumps, but hits the batsman on any part of his person other than the hand, then the batsman is out, even if that part of the person hit is not in line between wicket and wicket". The difference to the 1935 rule was that the batsman could now be out even if the ball struck outside the line of off-stump. This wording was adopted throughout the world, although it was not yet part of the official Laws, from 1972 and the percentage of lbws sharply increased to beyond the levels preceding the 1970 change. The MCC added the revised wording to the Laws of Cricket in 1980; this version of the lbw law is still used as of 2013.

Since 1993, the proportion of lbws in each English season has risen steadily. According to cricket historian Douglas Miller, the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball-tracking technology such as <a href="Hawk-Eye">Hawk-Eye</a> into their television coverage of matches. Miller writes: "With the passage of time and the adoption of Hawkeye into other sports, together with presentations demonstrating its accuracy, cricket followers seem gradually to have accepted its predictions. Replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an outstretched leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected." He also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence; their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batsmen who are standing further away from the stumps. This trend is replicated in international cricket, where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires. Spin bowlers in particular win far more appeals for lbw. However, the use of on-field technology has proved controversial; some critics regard it as more reliable than human judgement, while others believe that the umpire is better placed to make the decision.

The <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC), responsible for running the game worldwide, conducted a trial in 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the <a href="third%20umpire">third umpire</a>, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the <a href="Umpire%20Decision%20Review%20System">Umpire Decision Review System</a> (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, <a href="Dave%20Richardson%20%28cricketer%29">Dave Richardson</a>, DRS increased the frequency with which umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: "Umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they might, I suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out. I think if we're totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would."

Critics of the system suggest that rules for the use of DRS have created an inconsistency of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The <a href="Board%20of%20Control%20for%20Cricket%20in%20India">Board of Control for Cricket in India</a> (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation. However, as of 2016 they have accepted it.

A study in 2011 by Douglas Miller shows that in English <a href="County%20Championship">county cricket</a>, the proportion of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less likely to be out lbw when batting and more likely to dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batsmen from the subcontinent were less likely to be lbw wherever they played in the world.

Teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.

In his survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb suggests that "no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days". Among those who do not follow cricket, the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand, of equivalent complexity to <a href="Offside%20%28association%20football%29">association football's offside rule</a>. Owing to the difficulty of its interpretation, lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a yardstick by which an umpire's abilities are judged. In his book "Cricket and the Law: The Man in White Is Always Right", David Fraser writes that umpires' lbw decisions are frequently criticised and "arguments about bias and incompetence in adjudication inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions". Problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred. Controversial aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump, and in certain circumstances whether the batsman intended to hit the ball or leave it alone. Umpires are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players, commentators and spectators. Historically, trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions. For example, a prolonged crowd disturbance, in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed, took place when <a href="Mohammad%20Azharuddin">Mohammad Azharuddin</a> was adjudged lbw during a 1996 <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> in India.

Billy Martin

Alfred Manuel Martin Jr. (May 16, 1928 – December 25, 1989), commonly called Billy, was an American <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a> and <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> who, as well as leading other teams, was five times the manager of the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Known first as a scrappy infielder who made considerable contributions to the championship Yankee teams of the 1950s, he built a reputation as a manager who would initially make bad teams good, and then be fired amid dysfunction. In each of his stints with the Yankees, he managed them to winning records before being fired or forced to resign by team owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, usually amid a well-publicized scandal such as Martin's involvement in an alcohol-fueled fight.

Martin was born in a working-class section of <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. His skill as a baseball player gave him a route out of his home town. Signed by the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> <a href="Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29">Oakland Oaks</a>, Martin learned much from the man who would manage him both in Oakland and in New York, <a href="Casey%20Stengel">Casey Stengel</a>, and enjoyed a close relationship with him. Martin's spectacular catch of a wind-blown <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> popup late in Game Seven of the <a href="1952%20World%20Series">1952 World Series</a> saved that Series for the Yankees, and he was the hitting star of the <a href="1953%20World%20Series">1953 World Series</a>, earning the Most Valuable Player award in the Yankee victory. He missed most of two seasons, 1954 and 1955, after being <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">drafted into the Army</a>, and his abilities never fully returned; the Yankees traded him after a brawl at the <a href="Copacabana%20%28nightclub%29">Copacabana club</a> in New York during the 1957 season. Martin bitterly resented being traded, and did not speak to Stengel for years, a time during which Martin completed his playing career, appearing with a series of also-ran baseball teams.

The last team for whom Martin played, the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, gave him a job as a <a href="scout%20%28baseball%29">scout</a>, and he spent most of the 1960s with them, becoming a coach in 1965. After a successful managerial debut with the minor-league <a href="Denver%20Bears">Denver Bears</a>, Martin was made Twins manager in 1969, and led the club to the <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> title, but was fired after the season. He then was hired by a declining <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> franchise in 1971, and led the team to an <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> title in 1972 before being fired by the Tigers late in the 1973 season. He was quickly hired by the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>, and turned them for a season (1974) into a winning team, but was fired amid conflict with ownership in 1975. He was almost immediately hired by the Yankees.

As Yankee manager, Martin led the team to consecutive <a href="American%20League">American League</a> pennants in 1976 and 1977; the Yankees were swept in the <a href="1976%20World%20Series">1976 World Series</a> by the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> but triumphed over the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in six games in the <a href="1977%20World%20Series">1977 World Series</a>. The 1977 season saw season-long conflict between Martin and Steinbrenner, as well as between the manager and Yankee slugger <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, including a near brawl between the two in the dugout on national television, but culminated in Martin's only world championship as a manager. He was forced to resign midway through the 1978 season after saying of Jackson and Steinbrenner, "one's a born liar, and the other's convicted"; less than a week later, the news that he would return as manager in a future season was announced to a huge ovation from the <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> crowd. He returned in 1979, but was fired at season's end by Steinbrenner. From 1980 to 1982, he managed the <a href="Oakland%20A%27s">Oakland A's</a>, earning a division title with an aggressive style of play known as "Billyball", but he was fired after the 1982 season. He was rehired by the Yankees, whom he managed three more times, each for a season or less and each ending in his firing by Steinbrenner. Martin died in an automobile accident on Christmas night, 1989, and is fondly remembered by many Yankee fans.

Alfred Manuel Martin Jr. was born on May 16, 1928, in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. He was given his father's name; the elder Martin, usually nicknamed Al, was a truck driver for the city of Berkeley. Al Martin had been born in <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a>, the son of Portuguese immigrants, and had moved to <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a>. Billy Martin's mother's birth name was Juvan Salvini, but she went by the first name Jenny for most of her life. The daughter of Italian immigrants who had lived in San Francisco, but who moved across <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">the Bay</a> about the time of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Earthquake%20of%201906">1906 earthquake</a>, she also changed her last name, first when she married Donato Pisani around 1918, by whom she had a son, Frank, nicknamed Tudo, before the marriage broke up—Jenny later claimed Donato was unfaithful. There is some doubt that Jenny and Al ever married, but they lived together as a wedded couple for a time, during which Billy Martin was born at his maternal grandmother's house in <a href="West%20Berkeley">West Berkeley</a>.

Billy Martin acquired his name because his grandmother, who never mastered English, would croon "bello" (beautiful) repeatedly over the baby, who only learned his birth name when a teacher used it at school. The Martin couple broke up soon after Billy was born, and each later accused the other of infidelity. In any event, Billy Martin would have no further contact with his father until he was in his thirties, and the conflict between the parents likely left him with emotional wounds.

With Al Martin having returned to his native <a href="Hawaii%20Territory">Hawaii</a>, Jenny no longer used his name, either in conversation or as part of hers, and before Billy's first birthday had met John "Jack" Downey, a laborer and <a href="jack%20of%20all%20trades%2C%20master%20of%20none">jack-of-all-trades</a>, who she married in late 1929, and whose name she took for herself, but not for her sons. Billy Martin later called his stepfather a "great guy". Jenny always regretted that fame came to her son under the name Billy Martin, not Billy Downey.

Billy was an indifferent student once he started school, and from the age of about 12, was often in trouble with teachers or the principal. His unusual home situation, his small size and large nose, and his residence in poverty-stricken West Berkeley caused other children to mock him, leading to conflict. Intensely competitive and thin-skinned, he quickly gained a reputation as a street fighter who would do almost anything to win.

Sports proved an outlet for Martin's competitiveness. He boxed at an amateur level, but it was baseball that proved to be his calling. His older brother Tudo, 10 years his senior, had grown up with <a href="Augie%20Galan">Augie Galan</a>, an outfielder for the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> from 1934 to 1941 who continued in the major leagues until his retirement in 1949. Galan, like other professional ballplayers, made James Kenney Park in Berkeley his off-season training ground, for there was a well-maintained baseball field there. Tudo was a good enough ballplayer that he was often invited to play, and Billy would tag. As the boy got to play more and more as he grew, Galan took a special interest in tutoring Martin in the art of baseball.

When Martin reached <a href="Berkeley%20High%20School%20%28Berkeley%2C%20California%29">Berkeley High School</a>, which he attended from 1942 to 1946, he was dressed worse than many students from the more upscale housing east of <a href="San%20Pablo%20Avenue">San Pablo Avenue</a>, but gained acceptance through sports, especially baseball, raising his <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> from .210 as a <a href="sophomore">sophomore</a> to .450 as a <a href="senior%20%28education%29">senior</a>. He was an aggressive player, and was involved in fights both in and out of baseball uniform. One such on-field incident his senior year led to his dismissal from the team and concerned the professional baseball teams considering signing him. He was given a workout by the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, but they chose another California infielder, <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>.

The <a href="Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29">Oakland Oaks</a>, a <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> team, had been quietly scouting Martin for years, impressed with everything but his temper. Soon after Martin's high school graduation, Oaks trainer <a href="Red%20Adams">Red Adams</a> persuaded the team's new manager, <a href="Casey%20Stengel">Casey Stengel</a>, to give Martin a tryout. Stengel had seen Martin play in a high school all-star game, and though Martin did not play well, Stengel had told him that he had a future in baseball. Within weeks of the tryout, an infielder for the Oaks' <a href="Class%20D%20%28baseball%29">Class D</a> affiliate, the <a href="Idaho%20Falls%20Russets">Idaho Falls Russets</a>, was injured, and Stengel recommended that team owner Brick Laws sign Martin. Laws did so but first attempted, without success, to put a clause in the contract that would have nullified it if Martin misbehaved in a way similar to the fight that had ended his high school career. He would not be the last baseball owner to attempt to regulate Martin's behavior in such a manner.

The 18-year-old Martin was unimpressive with Idaho Falls in 1946, hitting .254 while playing mostly third base, and racking up many throwing errors. He had a good <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> with the Oaks in 1947, but was sent to the <a href="Class%20C%20%28baseball%29">Class C</a> <a href="Phoenix%20Senators">Phoenix Senators</a> of the <a href="Arizona-Texas%20League">Arizona-Texas League</a>. Martin felt he should have remained with the Oaks, and told Stengel so. The manager's response: "Prove me wrong".

Playing most day games in the arid Southwest in the era before widespread air conditioning, the Senators endured harsh playing and living conditions, as many of them boarded in a barracks beyond the right field fence. Nevertheless, Martin thrived there. Wearing the uniform number 1, a number he tried to secure with each team he played for, he hit .393, the highest average in <a href="organized%20baseball">organized baseball</a> in 1947, drove in 173 runs, and was named the league's most valuable player. When the team's regular second baseman was injured in a fight with opposing catcher <a href="Clint%20Courtney">Clint Courtney</a>—with whom Martin would lock horns himself—Martin was moved from third base, and would remain as a second baseman for most of the remainder of his playing career. Phoenix's season ended before that of the Oaks, and Martin was called up to the parent club. Though he did not play much, Martin won two games with doubles, and was an instant hit with the fans at Oaks Park.

When not playing, Martin closely shadowed Stengel, wanting to learn why the manager made the decisions he did. This impressed Stengel, who during his time as an outfielder for the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28baseball%29">New York Giants</a> had sought to learn from their manager, <a href="John%20McGraw">John McGraw</a>. Stengel and Martin grew closer in what has sometimes been described as a father-son relationship—Stengel had no children, and Martin had been abandoned by his father. According to Martin biographer <a href="Peter%20Golenbock">Peter Golenbock</a>, "the two men, the punk kid and the old-time ballplayer, would develop a bond that would not be broken for a decade. Binding them was their deep love for the game of baseball."

Martin made the Oaks' roster in 1948, but was slow to get regular playing time, as the Oaks had a former major-leaguer at each position and Stengel did not want to use Martin until the young ballplayer was ready. Instead, the manager had Martin sit on the bench next to him as he pointed out nuances of the game. Martin also learned about life on and off the field from his teammates.

Stengel assigned veteran players to work with Martin and be his roommate on road trips; at first Mel Duezabou, a student of the art of hitting with a lifetime minor league batting average over .300, who improved Martin at the plate. Later in the season, Duezabou was replaced with <a href="Cookie%20Lavagetto">Cookie Lavagetto</a>, a fellow infielder and former Dodgers star who was able to help Martin with fielding and advise him on what to expect in the major leagues. As injuries depleted the Oaks' regulars, Martin got increasing playing time, and finished the season with a .277 batting average, 3 home runs and 42 runs batted in. He became a team leader, active in brawls on the field and a loud and annoying <a href="bench%20jockey">bench jockey</a> in an era when a player often had to contend with a stream of insults from the opposing team's dugout. The Oaks won the PCL pennant and the <a href="Governors%27%20Cup">Governors' Cup</a> playoffs. Martin's reward for the championship was a new car, bought by Laws, but to his distress, Stengel's reward was the manager's job with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, leaving Martin feeling abandoned. He was especially dispirited because his lifelong desire was to be a Yankee.

Stengel's replacement with the Oaks was <a href="Charlie%20Dressen">Charlie Dressen</a>. Highly knowledgeable about the game, Dressen was initially wary of Martin as a Stengel favorite, but was won over by the second baseman's hard work and desire to learn. Martin's education continued under Dressen, as he learned such things as the art of stealing signs, and learned to try to force the other team into game-deciding mistakes. Although the team did not play as well as it had in 1948, Martin improved his statistics, hitting .286 with 12 home runs and 92 runs batted in. At the same time, Stengel, who was managing the Yankees to the 1949 American League pennant and a World Series triumph, talked of Martin to the New York press, leading many to assume he would soon be a Yankee. On October 13, 1949, Martin and fellow Oak <a href="Jackie%20Jensen">Jackie Jensen</a> were acquired by the Yankees.

Press coverage of Martin's sale by the Oaks to the Yankees dismissed him as a "<a href="utility%20infielder">utility infielder</a>", calling him "Alfred M. Martin", a name he detested. He was among those younger Yankees players, including <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a>, <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>, who reported in February 1950 to a pre-spring training <a href="Florida%20Instructional%20League">instructional camp</a> in Phoenix to work on fundamentals under Stengel's eye. Martin hoped to become the starting second baseman for the defending world champion Yankees, but the incumbent, <a href="Jerry%20Coleman">Jerry Coleman</a>, had just won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">American League Rookie of the League</a> award. On reporting to spring training in <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, he stood out for his brashness if nothing else, taking care to correct the press on how to refer to him.

Confident of Stengel's protection, Martin sometimes defied Yankee coaches such as <a href="Frank%20Crosetti">Frank Crosetti</a> and <a href="Jim%20Turner%20%28baseball%29">Jim Turner</a>, but won over most of his teammates as he showed his desire to learn and win, goals consistent with the "Yankee Way", that individual achievement was insignificant compared to team victory. Martin made his major league debut on April 18, 1950, Opening Day, for the Yankees as they visited the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> inserted in the eighth inning with the Yankees down, 9–4, with two men on base. Martin doubled off the <a href="Green%20Monster">Green Monster</a> in left field to drive in the runners. The Yankees <a href="batting%20around">batted around</a> and in his second at-bat of the inning, he singled with the bases loaded to drive in two more runs, the first time in major league history that a player got two hits in an inning in his debut game. Despite the feat, Martin was not made an everyday player, but sat next to Stengel in the dugout, listening and learning. When he did play, he quickly became a favorite of the <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> crowd, and they would remain loyal to him for the rest of his life.

Despite his stellar start, Martin was little-used by the Yankees in 1950 and 1951, as Coleman remained the starting second baseman. Martin was sent to the minor leagues in May 1950 to give him everyday playing experience, a decision with which he vociferously disagreed, and so stated to Yankee <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="George%20Weiss%20%28baseball%29">George Weiss</a>, an outburst that Martin always believed poisoned the relationship between himself and the team front office. He was recalled after a month, but remained mostly on the bench, with only 39 plate appearances for the Yankees in 1950, batting .250. The Yankees won the pennant again, and swept the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> in the <a href="1950%20World%20Series">1950 World Series</a>, in which Martin did not play and Coleman was the Most Valuable Player. After the season, with the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> raging, the 22-year-old was drafted into the army, but gained a <a href="hardship%20discharge">hardship discharge</a> after two months, something that made him less of a hero in West Berkeley. He was discharged in late April, and rejoined the Yankees, but was used sparingly, Rookie of the Year <a href="Gil%20McDougald">Gil McDougald</a> absorbing what playing time at second base was not used by Coleman. Martin, wearing uniform number 1 for the Yankees for the first time, hit .259 in 51 games. Martin helped bring rookie outfielder Mickey Mantle out of his shell, introducing him to New York nightlife. In the <a href="1951%20World%20Series">1951 World Series</a>, which the Yankees won in six games over the Giants, Martin did not bat, but was inserted as a <a href="pinch%20runner">pinch runner</a> in Game Two with the Yankees leading by a run after losing Game One. Martin scored a crucial insurance run in the Yankee victory, evading the tag from the catcher, <a href="Roy%20Noble">Roy Noble</a>, and after the game was singled out for praise by Giants manager <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a>.
Coleman's induction into the armed forces before the 1952 season opened the way for Martin to be the regular Yankee second baseman. His debut as such was delayed when he broke his ankle demonstrating the technique of sliding into second base on a television show in March, and it was not until May 12 that he made his regular season debut. Once he did, he hit .267 in 109 games, his highest as an everyday player, becoming the "sparkplug" that Stengel had sought for his team, energizing it. When Stengel offered $100 to any player who let himself be hit by a pitch, Martin earned $300 for the game. In the <a href="1952%20World%20Series">1952 World Series</a> against the Dodgers, Martin got 5 hits in 23 at-bats, but that included a three-run home run to break open Game Two and tie the series. In Game Four, with the Dodgers leading the Series two games to one and threatening to tie the one-run game in the fifth inning, Charlie Dressen, who was coaching third base for the Dodgers, called for the <a href="squeeze%20play%20%28baseball%29">squeeze play</a>. Martin stole the sign and the runner was out when pitcher <a href="Allie%20Reynolds">Allie Reynolds</a> threw a <a href="pitchout">pitchout</a>, killing the rally. In Game Seven, with the Yankees up 4–2 in the seventh inning, two outs, and the bases loaded, Jackie Robinson hit a high, wind-blown pop fly. When first baseman <a href="Joe%20Collins">Joe Collins</a> appeared to lose the ball in the sun, Martin raced in from second base, catching the ball in fair ground near home plate only inches off the grass. All three runners would most likely have scored had the ball dropped, giving the Dodgers the lead going into the eighth inning; Martin biographer David Falkner called the catch "one of the great moments in World Series history".

As Yankees' regular second baseman in 1953, Martin saw his average drop to .257, but set what would be career highs with 149 games played (146 at second base), 15 home runs and 75 runs batted in. He was also ejected for the first two occasions in his career, once for arguing balls and strikes, the other for fighting. With Martin's growing reputation as a fighter, opposing players often slid into second base hard, hoping to injure him: Stengel stated, "Billy’s being hit with the hardest blocks this side of a professional football field." Nevertheless, he finished second in the league in <a href="fielding%20percentage">fielding percentage</a> among second basemen. The Yankees won their fifth consecutive pennant, and in the <a href="1953%20World%20Series">1953 World Series</a>, Martin dominated, collecting 12 hits (tying a series record) with 23 <a href="total%20bases">total bases</a> (breaking Babe Ruth's record of 19) as the Yankees beat the Dodgers in six games; Martin's hit in the ninth inning of Game Six scored the winning run. He was elected the Series' Most Valuable Player. Stengel exulted, "Look at him. He doesn’t look like a great player—but he is a helluva player. Try to find something he can't do. You can't."
There had been congressional investigations into whether athletes and others were given preferable treatment to avoid conscription and, in early 1954, Martin was drafted into the army, his renewed request for a hardship discharge denied. He complained to a reporter that he was given worse treatment than his fellow soldiers, allowed fewer weekend passes and not allowed to play on the <a href="Fort%20Ord">Fort Ord</a> baseball team. He missed the entire 1954 season, in which the Yankees, uniquely during Martin's career with them, did not win the pennant, and much of the 1955 season. He was transferred to <a href="Fort%20Carson">Fort Carson</a> in Colorado, where he was allowed to live off base. He played on and managed the baseball team, and rose to the rank of corporal. In August 1955, a furlough allowed him to return to the Yankees and, when they won the pennant, it was extended for the <a href="1955%20World%20Series">1955 World Series</a>. Although Martin batted .300 for the regular season, and .320 with four runs batted in during the Series, the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in seven games, and Martin berated himself for letting down Stengel. He was discharged from the army later in October, having been awarded the <a href="Good%20Conduct%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">Good Conduct Medal</a>.

During the 1956 season, Weiss began to hint to the media that Martin was a poor influence on his fellow players, especially on his roommate, Mantle, with whom he often caroused until the early hours of the morning. A dignified man, Weiss did not feel that Martin fit the image he wanted for the Yankees, and may have been offended by the player's outburst on being sent to the minors in 1950. By 1956, the Yankees were developing the next wave of infielders, including <a href="Bobby%20Richardson">Bobby Richardson</a> and <a href="Tony%20Kubek">Tony Kubek</a>. Weiss would have liked to trade Martin, but was deterred by the fact that the second baseman was extremely popular with Yankee fans and with the press covering the team. Although Martin appeared in the <a href="1956%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1956 All-Star Game</a>—his only All-Star appearance as a player—his abilities as a player never fully returned after leaving the army. With Richardson progressing rapidly through the Yankee <a href="farm%20system">farm system</a>, Martin worried that his days with the team were numbered. Nevertheless, he hit .264 with nine home runs for the Yankees in 1956, and in the <a href="1956%20World%20Series">1956 World Series</a> against the Dodgers, Martin played well both in the field and at the plate, getting the hit that gave the Yankees the lead for good in Game Four to tie the Series, and hitting .296 with two home runs as the Yankees won in seven games, thus finishing his World Series career as a player with a .333 batting average.

Weiss warned Martin before the 1957 season to avoid trouble, and the infielder did nothing to aid his own cause by injuring both himself and Mantle (the reigning MVP) in an intentional collision between their <a href="golf%20cart">golf cart</a>s as they played a round on a Florida course during spring training. While Martin recovered from this and other injuries, Bobby Richardson played, showing a fielding range that Martin no longer possessed. But the incident that gave Weiss the leeway to trade Martin was a brawl at the <a href="Copacabana%20%28nightclub%29">Copacabana nightclub</a> in New York on May 16. Although it was fellow Yankee <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a> who was accused of throwing the first punch, Martin believed that Weiss would blame him, and as the trade deadline of June 15 approached, his foreboding and tension grew. Stories differ about how Martin learned he had been traded to the <a href="Kansas%20City%20A%27s">Kansas City A's</a> on the trade deadline: biographer David Falkner stated that Martin, out of the lineup in the game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium, was informed by farm director <a href="Lee%20MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a>, and that Stengel refused to see Martin, but Martin in his autobiography alleged that he had been sitting in the bullpen and that Stengel came to inform him. <a href="Marty%20Appel">Marty Appel</a>, in his biography of Stengel, stated that Martin was called in to see Stengel, was told of the trade, and Martin blamed the manager for not preventing it. According to Appel, "No one had worn the Yankees uniform more proudly than Billy; it was like a fraternity jacket to him. An eighteen-year exile was beginning for him, and his sadness, bitterness, melancholy, resentment, and hurt never really faded. His career as a journeyman infielder—playing with six teams, none more than a year, and never to see the World Series again—had begun." Among the consequences of the trade was the loss of the relationship with Stengel, with whom he rarely spoke in the years that followed.

Martin switched dugouts after the trade to the A's, and in his first game got two hits, including a home run off the Yankees' <a href="Johnny%20Kucks">Johnny Kucks</a>. Then the Yankees left town, without Martin, who now faced playing for a seventh-place team with little hope of doing better. He hit .360 in his first ten games, but the A's lost nine of them. Although Martin hit .257 with Kansas City, an improvement over the .241 he was hitting with the Yankees, the A's lost 94 games, finishing 38 games behind the Yankees. At the end of the season, Martin was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a 13-player deal, and he stated angrily, "They just can’t throw us [players] around from one club to another without us having a say-so."

Detroit manager <a href="Jack%20Tighe">Jack Tighe</a> called Martin "the key to our future"; he was expected to electrify the team as he had the Yankees. Without talent on the field and Stengel in the dugout to back him up, Martin was unable to do that, as after a decent start, the Tigers settled down to a losing season, and the players became annoyed at Martin's ways. The Tigers had him play shortstop, but he lacked the range and the throwing arm needed to be effective, and made 20 errors for the season. He hit .255 with seven home runs, but the Tigers finished fifth, 15 games behind the Yankees. After the season, Martin and <a href="Al%20Cicotte">Al Cicotte</a> were traded to Cleveland in exchange for <a href="Don%20Mossi">Don Mossi</a>, <a href="Ray%20Narleski">Ray Narleski</a> and <a href="Ossie%20Alvarez">Ossie Alvarez</a>.

With Martin at second base, the Indians finished second in 1959, five games behind the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> and ahead of the third-place Yankees. Despite the relatively good finish, Martin was embittered, contending that if manager <a href="Joe%20Gordon">Joe Gordon</a> had used him properly, the Indians would have won the pennant. In August, Martin, who did not wear a <a href="batting%20helmet">batting helmet</a>, was hit on the head by a pitch from <a href="Tex%20Clevenger">Tex Clevenger</a> of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>, breaking a cheekbone and giving him an unconscious fear of being hit again, diminishing his effectiveness at the plate. He was traded, after the season, to the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>; manager <a href="Fred%20Hutchinson">Fred Hutchinson</a> hoped Martin could instill some fight into his team. Although he could not make the Reds a winner with his diminished skills, he still was a battler on the field, notoriously fighting pitcher <a href="Jim%20Brewer">Jim Brewer</a> of the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> on August 4, 1960. In the aftermath of his beaning by Clevenger, teams pitched Martin inside, as did Brewer. After one such pitch, Martin, on the next, swung and let his bat go, though it landed far from the <a href="pitching%20mound">pitching mound</a>. When he went out to retrieve it, Brewer approached, Martin swung at him, and sometime during the brawl, a punch broke Brewer's <a href="orbital%20bone">orbital bone</a>, though whether it was Martin who did it or Reds pitcher <a href="Cal%20McLish">Cal McLish</a> is uncertain. Martin was ejected (his sixth and final ejection as a player), and was suspended for five games and fined by National League president <a href="Warren%20Giles">Warren Giles</a>. With Brewer out for the season, the Cubs sued Martin. Litigation dragged on for a decade and the case was eventually settled in 1969 for $10,000 plus $12,000 attorney's fees. Martin, who in the press defended his actions as justified given pitchers threw inside to him, asked, "Do they want a check or cash?"

Although Martin played 103 games for the Reds in 1960, batting .246, he had only three home runs and 16 runs batted in, and following the season was sold to the <a href="Milwaukee%20Braves">Milwaukee Braves</a>. His old manager with the Oaks, Dressen, led the Braves, but even he could not find a starting position for Martin. He had only six at-bats for the Braves, with no hits, and on June 1, 1961, was traded to the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> for <a href="Billy%20Consolo">Billy Consolo</a>. Martin, given the starting second baseman position, started well and finished well for the Twins, but in between had a prolonged batting slump. Between the Braves and Twins, he batted .242 for 1961, his lowest full-season average. He reported for spring training in 1962, but was soon approached by manager <a href="Sam%20Mele">Sam Mele</a>, a longtime friend, and told that he had been released by the team. No longer able to compete on the field, Martin's playing career was over at the age of 32.

Martin accepted an offer by Twins owner <a href="Calvin%20Griffith">Calvin Griffith</a> to be a scout for the team. He also took a job with <a href="Grain%20Belt%20Brewery">Grain Belt Brewery</a> in public relations. The combination worked well; Martin proved himself a competent evaluator of talent, while selling the Twins in bars across Minnesota. He urged the Twins to sign pitching prospect <a href="Jim%20Palmer">Jim Palmer</a>, but Griffith was unwilling to pay the $50,000 signing bonus Palmer requested, and the pitcher went on to a Hall of Fame career with the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. With his survival in baseball on the line, Martin kept his nose clean, his drinking moderate, and his fists unclenched.

With manager Mele's consent, Griffith made Martin third base coach before the 1965 season, leading to immediate media speculation that when the Twins hit a rough patch, Martin would be appointed as manager. Mele later denied having any feeling that Martin was after his job, and the Twins experienced few losing streaks in 1965, winning the American League pennant. Martin worked with the players to make them more aggressive on the base paths. He recognized the talent of the young <a href="Rod%20Carew">Rod Carew</a>, and spent much time working with him to make him a better ballplayer. The Twins had tried to trade shortstop <a href="Zoilo%20Versalles">Zoilo Versalles</a> the previous winter; Martin worked on his hitting and base running and Versalles was voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Although the Twins lost the <a href="1965%20World%20Series">1965 World Series</a> to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in seven games, Martin was given much of the credit for getting them there.

In 1966, Martin damaged his chances of promotion to the managerial job by getting in a fight with Twins traveling secretary <a href="Howard%20Fox%20%28baseball%20executive%29">Howard Fox</a>. The Twins and Yankees shared a charter flight, and the players got rowdy. Martin refused Fox's request that he intercede with his former teammates, including Mantle and Ford, to get them to quiet down. When the Twins reached their hotel, Fox was slow to give Martin his room key, violating baseball's usual etiquette that the manager and coaches got theirs first. When Martin demanded it, Fox threw it at him, and after words were exchanged, Martin hit him in the face. Martin was fined by Griffith, a friend of Fox's. When Mele was fired in 1967, his replacement was not Martin, as had been widely speculated, but <a href="Cal%20Ermer">Cal Ermer</a>.
The Twins started the 1968 season poorly and Martin was called into Griffith's office, expecting to be offered Ermer's job. Instead, the owner wanted to make Martin the manager of the <a href="Denver%20Bears">Denver Bears</a>, the Twins' top affiliate, at that time with an 8–22 record. Martin was reluctant to accept, but did when his wife Gretchen told him that he needed to prove his ability as a manager before getting a job as one in the major leagues. The Bears started well under .500, but by the end of the season had a winning record. Martin had stressed to the team that they were a single unit, with him as boss. He instituted the aggressive base running he had used in Minnesota, and focused on fundamentals. When the team lost, he told them (and anyone else within earshot) exactly why they had lost; third baseman <a href="Graig%20Nettles">Graig Nettles</a>, who would play again for Martin as a major leaguer, stated Martin made the players afraid to lose. He defended them before the outside world, confronting umpires—he was ejected from games eight times. The team was 65–50 under Martin, and by season's end there was widespread speculation that Martin would be a major league manager in 1969. Despite the two AL expansion teams, the <a href="Seattle%20Pilots">Seattle Pilots</a> and <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>, having vacancies, and expressing interest in hiring Martin, he stated that his loyalty was to the Twins, who had had another disappointing season. On October 11, 1968, the Twins gave Martin a one-year contract as manager. Said Griffith, "I feel like I'm sitting on a keg of dynamite."

As Twins manager, Martin continued the aggressive baseball he had urged on the team as third-base coach. The team lost the first four games of the season, on the road, but came home to the largest Opening Day crowd since the franchise moved to Minnesota. Winning streaks of 5 and 8 games in April established the team in first place in the new <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> and kept the fans coming to <a href="Metropolitan%20Stadium">Metropolitan Stadium</a>. Martin set a tone of willingness to do anything to win. When <a href="Oakland%20A%27s">Oakland A's</a> slugger <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a> hit home runs in his first two at bats against the Twins, Minnesota pitcher <a href="Dick%20Woodson">Dick Woodson</a> threw a pitch behind Jackson's head. After a second pitch closer to Jackson's head than to the plate, the slugger charged the mound, provoking a full-scale brawl, for which Jackson later blamed Martin, who he said had ordered the pitches.

Despite the winning baseball, owner Griffith was less than enamored with Martin's conduct. Griffith wanted Martin to meet regularly with him to discuss the team; Martin repeatedly showed up during the time set aside for Griffith's daily nap. When pitcher <a href="Dave%20Boswell%20%28baseball%29">Dave Boswell</a> and outfielder <a href="Bob%20Allison">Bob Allison</a> got into a fight outside the Lindell A. C. sports bar in August, Martin joined the battle, repeatedly punching Boswell, who won 20 games that year. Martin claimed that Boswell had come at him first, which Boswell denied. Although it was Boswell who was fined by the team, Griffith considered firing Martin, but decided that the victories on the field justified keeping him. The Twins won the Western Division by 9 games over Oakland, with Boswell winning 8 games down the stretch.

The Twins played the Orioles, who had won 109 games during the regular season (the Twins had won 97) and who were managed by <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a> in the <a href="1969%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1969 American League Championship Series</a> (ALCS). Baltimore won the first two games of the best-of-five series at home, with both games going extra innings. At home for Game Three, Martin was expected to start star pitcher <a href="Jim%20Kaat">Jim Kaat</a> but instead chose <a href="Bob%20Miller%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201939%29">Bob Miller</a>, who was knocked out of the box in the second inning, and the Twins were eliminated.

Martin had been given a one-year contract for 1969; he asked for a two-year deal for 1970 and 1971. Griffith was unhappy both that Martin had not pitched Kaat (a friend of his) and that the explanation he had asked Martin for had been "Because I'm the manager". Martin's decision was defensible, as Kaat had been struggling with injuries, and Miller had won during the pennant race. Other events during the season, such as the fight with Boswell and Martin kicking former US vice president <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> out of the locker room when he tried to visit after a Twins loss also embarrassed the team. Although Martin had led the team to a division title, Fox and other Twins executives felt Martin was more trouble than he was worth and urged his dismissal. Griffith fired him on October 13, 1969. There was outrage among Twins fans, and attendance, which had been boosted by Martin's presence and the team's success, sank in 1970. The Twins won their second straight division title but again lost <a href="1970%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">the ALCS</a> to Baltimore in three games, this time with Kaat pitching—and losing—Game Three.

Martin spent the 1970 season unemployed by any baseball team, working as a radio interviewer for Minneapolis station <a href="KDWB">KDWB</a>. He received nibbles of interest, including from A's owner <a href="Charlie%20Finley">Charlie Finley</a>, and each later blamed the other for the failure to come to terms. The <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> had won <a href="1968%20World%20Series">the World Series in 1968</a>, but dropped below .500 two years later. Team general manager <a href="Jim%20Campbell%20%28baseball%20executive%29">Jim Campbell</a> felt that the team could win again with the right manager. On October 2, 1970, Campbell gave Martin a two-year deal (for 1971 and 1972) at an annual salary of $65,000. Martin seemed to be an odd fit for the Tigers, given their straitlaced reputation under Campbell's watch, but the manager felt that Martin was the spark the Tigers needed to return to contention.

Martin announced that the Tigers would win the 1971 <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> title, and that the Orioles were over the hill. He made it clear that he was going to run the team his way, and his clubhouse tirades for poor play even during spring training were reported in the media and concerned Detroit management. He had a well-publicized feud with slugger <a href="Willie%20Horton%20%28baseball%29">Willie Horton</a>, whom Martin repeatedly benched and who kept himself out of the lineup with an alleged injury that Martin disputed. There were repeated conflicts with umpires, and with personnel off the field: he accused the organist in Oakland of trying to distract his players, and the scoreboard operators in Baltimore with spying on his team. After a poor April, Martin's players won seven in a row to surge to within 4 games of the top-placing Red Sox near the start of June. The results helped establish Martin as one of the best managers in baseball, at least on the field. His generalship could not paper over the flaws in the ball club, and the Tigers finished second, 11 games behind the Orioles. The team's improvement by 12 victories to a record of 91–71 proved to many people that Martin's success in Minnesota had not been a fluke.

Martin was rewarded with a new two-year contract, through 1973, with an increase in salary. At spring training, Martin was relaxed and confident, his Tigers a favorite to win the American League East. The season started late, due to a player's strike, and the missed games were not made up, which left the teams playing an unequal number of games. Once play started, Martin was his usual self, berating opposing managers and the umpires from the dugout, and being ejected for it in the second game of the season, against Baltimore and Weaver. This was his first ejection as Tigers manager. There was a close AL East pennant race in 1972, when the Tigers and Orioles were joined by the Yankees and Red Sox in contending for the division title. With Detroit winning, those players hostile to Martin remained silent. The season came down to a three-game set between the Tigers and Red Sox, with Boston a half game ahead. The Tigers won the first two, though they lost the meaningless third game, making them the AL East champs by a half game.

In the <a href="1972%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1972 American League Championship Series</a>, the Tigers faced the Oakland A's. The Tigers lost Game One in extra innings. With the A's up 5–0 in Game Two, Tigers pitcher <a href="Lerrin%20LaGrow">Lerrin LaGrow</a> hit the speedy A's shortstop, <a href="Bert%20Campaneris">Bert Campaneris</a>, in the legs. Before a national television audience, Campaneris threw his bat towards the mound, and a brawl ensued. Many believed Martin had ordered Campaneris hit. The Tigers recovered from the 2–0 deficit by winning Games Three and Four at <a href="Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29">Tiger Stadium</a>, but lost Game Five and the series. Martin was praised for taking the Tigers as far as he did, but his lineup choices for Game Five were questioned—playing catcher <a href="Bill%20Freehan">Bill Freehan</a> with a broken thumb, while a healthy catcher, <a href="Duke%20Sims">Duke Sims</a>, played left field instead of Horton. Both of Martin's choices were involved in plays that resulted in A's runs, which a better-fielding player might have prevented. Nevertheless, Martin again received a revised two-year contract, through the 1974 season.

The Tigers did not repeat in 1973, as the Orioles won the division. Nevertheless, Martin did have some successes, making <a href="John%20Hiller">John Hiller</a> a successful <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> after the pitcher had survived a heart attack, and discovering <a href="Ron%20LeFlore">Ron LeFlore</a> in a Michigan prison; LeFlore would go on to a successful major league career. Martin wanted general manager Campbell to trade some aging veterans to renew the squad, but Campbell refused. Martin briefly quit during spring training when Campbell did not uphold a fine he had imposed on Horton. Factional conflict within the team, muted by the team's 1972 success, resurged as the team, after contending for first place with the Orioles and Yankees, in August fell further from the lead. Martin criticized the front office in the media. On August 30, frustrated that umpires were not calling Indians pitcher <a href="Gaylord%20Perry">Gaylord Perry</a> for <a href="spitball">spitball</a>s, Martin ordered his pitchers to do the same, and told the media what he had done after the game. He was suspended by AL president <a href="Joe%20Cronin">Joe Cronin</a> for breaching league rules. Campbell had seen enough, and fired Martin before the suspension ran out.

<a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> owner <a href="Bob%20Short">Bob Short</a> was a person Martin knew and trusted from the time in the 1960s when Short was an executive with the Twins. After Martin was dismissed by the Tigers, Short told his manager, <a href="Whitey%20Herzog">Whitey Herzog</a>, that he would fire his own grandmother to have a chance to hire Martin. Short, days later, fired Herzog and hired Martin, provoking Herzog's comment, "I'm fired, I'm the grandmother."

Martin faced a serious challenge in trying to rebuild a team that was 47–81 and would lose 105 games that season. No pitcher on the staff won more than nine games that year, and the team had the worst fan attendance in baseball. But Martin felt Short understood him, and he was given a five-year contract with, informally, control over who would be on the Rangers' 25-player roster. Martin faced a receptive clubhouse; most of the players had grown up watching him as a Yankee on television.
Over the winter of 1973–1974, Martin made several trades, bringing <a href="Ferguson%20Jenkins">Ferguson Jenkins</a> from the Cubs in exchange for <a href="Bill%20Madlock">Bill Madlock</a>. Jenkins and <a href="Jim%20Bibby">Jim Bibby</a> would anchor the pitching staff. He promoted <a href="Jim%20Sundberg">Jim Sundberg</a> and <a href="Mike%20Hargrove">Mike Hargrove</a> to the Rangers from the lower minor leagues. Short sold the team to <a href="Brad%20Corbett">Brad Corbett</a> just before the 1974 season began; the new owner retained Martin as manager, but did not allow him control of the roster.

The Rangers opened at <a href="Arlington%20Stadium">Arlington Stadium</a> against the two-time defending world champion A's: Martin billed the series as the meeting of the top two AL West teams though <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a> put the Rangers at 50–1 to win the division. The A's won two of three, but all the games were close. After winning a series at Oakland at the end of April marked by aggressive baserunning, the Rangers were in first place. Martin taught the Rangers to improve their play and to beware his rage; outfielder <a href="Tom%20Grieve">Tom Grieve</a> later stated that he made the team afraid to lose.

The Rangers stayed close to the division lead through May and June, though they dropped to fourth place and eight games back at the <a href="MLB%20All-Star%20break">All-Star break</a>. The Rangers kept the race close until late September, and finished second, five games back, their record of 84–76 a considerable improvement on 1973. Martin was named AL Manager of the Year, and home attendance more than doubled.

Given their strong performance in 1974 and Martin's reputation for building winners, the Rangers were the favorite in the AL West for 1975 over the three-time defending world champion A's. The team underperformed, however, Jenkins going from 25 wins to 17 and other key players not doing as well as in 1974. After a slow start, the Rangers recovered to some extent, but near the end of June found themselves 12 games behind the A's. Relations between Martin and the Ranger front office were strained by off-field issues, including Martin's drinking and conflict with some of the players, including Sundberg. As he lost control of his team, Martin struck Rangers traveling secretary <a href="Bert%20Hawkins%20%28baseball%29">Bert Hawkins</a>, allegedly for organizing a players' wives' club. In July, after a dispute with Corbett over whether to sign free agent catcher <a href="Tom%20Egan">Tom Egan</a>, Martin told the media that the owner, who had made a fortune selling plumbing pipes, "knows as much about baseball as I do about pipe". Corbett began consulting the minority owners to decide whether to fire Martin, and informed the manager of this. One day later, on July 20, after Martin ordered the public address announcer to play "<a href="Thank%20God%20I%27m%20a%20Country%20Boy">Thank God I'm a Country Boy</a>" during the <a href="seventh%20inning%20stretch">seventh inning stretch</a> instead of "<a href="Take%20Me%20Out%20to%20the%20Ball%20Game">Take Me Out to the Ball Game</a>" (as Corbett had instructed), he was fired.

Martin was not out of work for very long. Two weeks after Texas fired Martin, manager <a href="Bill%20Virdon">Bill Virdon</a> was fired by the Yankees. The former Yankee second baseman was hired to take his place, marking Martin's first time in a Yankee uniform since the 1957 trade. Some players and writers have concluded that he had long campaigned for the Yankee job; what is certain is that after Martin was dismissed by Texas, New York general manager <a href="Gabe%20Paul">Gabe Paul</a>, acting on behalf of team owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, was quickly in touch, and an agreement soon followed. Well aware of Martin's behavioral proclivities, Paul and Steinbrenner believed they could keep Martin under control. They not only inserted good-conduct clauses in Martin's contract, but picked the coaching staff themselves.

With little chance of catching the first-place Red Sox, Martin spent the remainder of the 1975 season evaluating his team, cultivating the press and getting ready for 1976. At that time, Paul was operating head of the franchise; Steinbrenner had been suspended from baseball by Commissioner <a href="Bowie%20Kuhn">Bowie Kuhn</a> following his conviction for making illegal contributions to <a href="Committee%20to%20Re-Elect%20the%20President">Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign</a>, but continued to make decisions (such as Martin's hiring) behind the scenes. With Martin at the helm, the Yankees went 30–26 in their final 56 games of the 1975 season; they ended the season in third place, where they had been when he took over.

Martin worked with Paul during the offseason to dispose of players such as <a href="Bobby%20Bonds">Bobby Bonds</a> and <a href="Doc%20Medich">Doc Medich</a>, obtaining in return <a href="Mickey%20Rivers">Mickey Rivers</a>, <a href="Willie%20Randolph">Willie Randolph</a> and others. The <a href="1976%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1976 Yankee season</a> was probably his most trouble-free as a major league manager. Martin endeared himself to his players quickly by effectively winning a game in Milwaukee. He pointed out that the first-base umpire had, almost unnoticed, called time out just before an apparent game-winning grand slam by <a href="Don%20Money">Don Money</a>. Steinbrenner had been restored to the Yankee offices when Kuhn shortened his suspension during spring training, but did not interfere with Martin's managing, content to sit back and watch as the Yankees continued to win.
The Yankees won the AL East by 11 games over Baltimore, securing their first postseason appearance since 1964. In the <a href="1976%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1976 American League Championship Series</a>, they played Kansas City. Aggressive baserunning, plus <a href="bench%20jockey">bench jockey</a>ing that may have caused Royals third baseman <a href="George%20Brett">George Brett</a> to make two crucial errors, helped New York win Game One, but Kansas City won two of the next three. Martin's choice of <a href="Ed%20Figueroa">Ed Figueroa</a> to pitch the decisive Game Five at Yankee Stadium was controversial as Figueroa had not pitched well late in the season and had lost Game Two, but he was in good form and helped the Yankees to a 6–3 lead in the eighth inning—when Brett tied the game with a three-run home run. Martin did not let the home run faze him, and had a verbal exchange with the next batter, <a href="John%20Mayberry">John Mayberry</a>, which helped wake the Yankees up from their stunned disbelief at Brett's home run. Yankee first baseman <a href="Chris%20Chambliss">Chris Chambliss</a> drove the first pitch of the bottom of the ninth over the right field wall, and the Yankees had their first pennant since 1964, and Martin his first as a manager. The Yankees faced the defending world champion Reds in the <a href="1976%20World%20Series">1976 World Series</a>, and lost in four straight games. Martin was ejected from Game Four, at Yankee Stadium, after rolling a baseball towards umpire <a href="Bruce%20Froemming">Bruce Froemming</a>, the only Yankee to ever be kicked out of a World Series game.

In the offseason, Steinbrenner sought to sign free agent outfielder Reggie Jackson, convinced that he would add punch to the middle of the Yankee lineup. Steinbrenner wooed the slugger, taking him to lunch at the <a href="21%20Club">21 Club</a> and walking with him on Manhattan's sidewalks as fans called out to Jackson, urging him to become a Yankee. Though New York did not make the highest offer, Jackson signed with the team. Sources record Martin's views on Jackson's signing differently: Pennington stated that Martin was not opposed and told Steinbrenner he could use a right fielder, whereas Golenbock deemed Martin ""certainly" didn't want Reggie", feeling that Jackson was too much of a prima donna, who might rebel against the manager's authority, and be "tougher to handle than a bull at a rodeo". Falkner wrote that while Martin did not see Jackson as filling the team's needs, he was not opposed. Both Martin and Paul stated that once <a href="Bobby%20Grich">Bobby Grich</a> was signed by the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a>, Martin supported signing Jackson. Nevertheless, Martin was embittered by Steinbrenner taking Jackson to famous restaurants when he had not invited Martin to lunch, even though the manager was spending the offseason in nearby New Jersey.
When the Yankees lost six of the first eight games of the 1977 season, Steinbrenner called separate meetings with the players, the manager and the press, and told Martin that he had better get the team to turn things around or he could expect to be fired. Steinbrenner told the press what he had told Martin. In May, Jackson alienated most of his teammates by saying in an interview that he, rather than the respected team captain, <a href="Thurman%20Munson">Thurman Munson</a>, was "the straw that stirs the drink" on the team. Martin was drinking heavily, and had briefly quit in spring training following an argument with Steinbrenner, who was, according to Falkner, "the owner whose idea of 'hands-on' was a stranglehold". 
Jackson's ties to Steinbrenner, who had given him his contract, made Martin powerless to discipline the slugger. Golenbock noted,

The question of whether the strife between Martin and Jackson involved a racial element has divided Yankee players and those who have written about the 1977 team. In his 2013 autobiography, Jackson stated that there was, and that Martin and some white Yankees would tell racist jokes. Among black Yankees who were there when Martin was, <a href="Elliott%20Maddox">Elliott Maddox</a> agreed with Jackson but others, such as Chambliss, denied there was racism.

Tensions between Martin and Jackson exploded on national television on June 18 at Fenway Park, the NBC <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Game%20of%20the%20Week">Saturday afternoon Game of the Week</a>, with the Yankees a half game behind the Red Sox. Martin pulled Jackson off the field mid-inning (replacing him with <a href="Paul%20Blair%20%28baseball%29">Paul Blair</a>) for failing to hustle on a shallow outfield fly ball by <a href="Jim%20Rice">Jim Rice</a>, allowing Rice to reach second base. The extremely angry Martin had to be restrained by coaches <a href="Elston%20Howard">Elston Howard</a> and <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a> from getting into a fight with Jackson in the dugout, scenes shown across the nation by NBC. Steinbrenner was convinced that he should fire Martin, but negotiations brokered by backup catcher <a href="Fran%20Healy%20%28baseball%29">Fran Healy</a> secured a truce. Nevertheless, the rumors that Martin would be fired, some originated by Steinbrenner, would continue season-long. All of this went on in the full glare of New York's newspapers and, with the public firmly on Martin's side, Steinbrenner stayed his hand. According to Appel in his history of the Yankees, "the team was winning, the turnstiles were clicking, and the Yanks were dominating the sports pages".

By August 7, there was renewed conflict on the team, including between Martin and Jackson, and the Yankees had fallen five games behind the Red Sox. Martin had pledged to bat Jackson <a href="cleanup%20hitter">cleanup</a>, as he wanted, but had rarely done so. Healy and Munson interceded with Martin, and when Martin batted Jackson fourth on August 10, both Jackson and the team responded by going on hot streaks. Despite a season of turmoil, the Yankees won 40 of their last 50 games to take the division by 2 games over both Boston and Baltimore. Appel noted, "The '77 Yanks won 100 games and the division title, but Billy Martin looked much more like a man who had taken each of the 62 defeats as a sock in the face. Hidden behind dark glasses, losing weight, drinking excessively, he had been through hell and back."

The Yankees played the Royals again in the <a href="1977%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1977 American League Championship Series</a>, the teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium, and the Royals won Game Three in Kansas City. Needing to win two straight on the road to win the pennant, the Yankees won Game Four, and Martin benched Jackson from the starting lineup in Game Five, feeling that he did not hit Royals pitcher <a href="Paul%20Splittorff">Paul Splittorff</a> well. In the eighth inning, with the Yankees losing 3–1, Martin put Jackson in as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> and Jackson singled off reliever <a href="Doug%20Bird">Doug Bird</a> to drive in a run. The Yankees scored three runs in the ninth to win their second straight pennant, 5–3.

The <a href="1977%20World%20Series">1977 World Series</a> was against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. In Game One in New York, the Yankees won 4–3 in 12 innings on a single by Blair, who had replaced Jackson late in the game for defensive reasons. The Yankees lost Game Two, and on the off day before Game Three at <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a>, there was more conflict in the press between Martin and Jackson. A conference in Gabe Paul's hotel room smoothed matters over, and the Yankees won Games Three and Four, but lost Game Five to send the series back to New York. Prior to Game Six, the Yankees announced that Martin was being given a bonus and an extended contract, relieving some of the intense pressure on him—the media had reported that he would be fired if the Yankees lost the World Series. Jackson, who had been mockingly dubbed <a href="Mr.%20October">Mr. October</a> by Munson during the conflict before Game Three, made the name his own by hitting three home runs off three Dodger pitchers on consecutive pitches, and the Yankees won 8–4, before a jubilant crowd which invaded the field after the final pitch. Jackson and Martin were interviewed for television with arms around each other. Golenbeck noted that Martin "had fought the other teams in the league, fought his star player, and fought his owner, who respected no man". According to Appel, "it would be the only world championship of Martin's managing career, and it was a painful one".

The events of 1977 placed Martin among the most prominent New York celebrities, a status he would keep until his death, as headline writers would refer to "Billy" without fear of readers misunderstanding who was meant. He was seen in the city's nightlife, often with different young women, at a time when his second marriage was disintegrating after years of turmoil. Paul's departure to run the Cleveland Indians after the 1977 season removed one of the buffers between Martin and Steinbrenner; Martin blamed the owner for constant interference during the season. Paul was replaced by <a href="Al%20Rosen">Al Rosen</a>.

There was no relief from conflict when the 1978 season began, with Mickey Rivers benched after appearing to loaf after a fly ball, and an alcohol-fueled altercation between team members on an airplane that helped put an end to the Yankees flying on commercial airlines in favor of charter flights. Steinbrenner blamed Martin for failure to keep discipline; the manager did not believe in trying to regulate the players' conduct off the field, something he had learned from Casey Stengel. Injuries to several players, including much of the starting staff, meant the Yankees did not commence the season as well as the previous year. By mid-June, the Yankees were seven games behind the Red Sox, and Steinbrenner was impatient. Repeated rumors that he would be fired put Martin under extreme stress.

By July 17, the Yankees were 13 games behind Boston. That day, against the Royals, Jackson came to the plate in the bottom of the tenth inning with Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off, with Jackson instructed to swing away. Jackson tried to bunt the next two pitches, and popped out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but on conversing with upper management agreed on a five-game suspension. When Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him. Martin also learned, from White Sox owner <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a>, that while Steinbrenner had been publicly pledging that Martin would remain Yankee manager for the rest of the season no matter what, he had been trying to arrange a trade of managers with Chicago, with New York to receive <a href="Bob%20Lemon">Bob Lemon</a>, through the deal was not made and Lemon had been subsequently fired by Veeck. Martin told reporters of Jackson and Steinbrenner, "They deserve each other." He went on to say of Jackson, "one's a born liar" and then referred to Steinbrenner's illegal contributions by saying "and the other's convicted".

The next day, July 24, 1978, Martin resigned at a tearful press conference in Kansas City, having quit before he could be fired by Rosen, stating that he was doing so for health reasons. Steinbrenner replaced Martin with Lemon. There was considerable anger among Yankee fans at Martin's forced departure, and towards Steinbrenner; some holders of season tickets burned them outside Yankee Stadium.

Steinbrenner almost immediately had second thoughts about Martin's departure, and negotiations for his return, including meetings between the two, began within two days of the resignation. At first, the plan was for Martin to return in 1979, working elsewhere in the organization until then, but Rosen felt Lemon, who replaced Martin, needed to be given a full year. The talks were successfully kept quiet, and at <a href="Old-Timers%27%20Day">Old-Timers' Day</a> at Yankee Stadium, July 29, 1978, Martin was introduced as the Yankee manager for 1980 and after by public address announcer <a href="Bob%20Sheppard">Bob Sheppard</a>, meeting an ovation from the crowd second only to that given <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> on his retirement in 1939; according to Golenbock it might have been greater, "The fans "liked" Gehrig. They "loved" Billy."
The re-hiring was only a verbal commitment, and was to some extent dependent on Martin staying out of trouble, which he did not do. During the offseason, Martin engaged in fisticuffs with "<a href="Reno%20Gazette-Journal">Reno Gazette</a>" reporter Ray Hagar while visiting the city as a guest of the <a href="Reno%20Bighorns">Reno Bighorns</a> basketball team. Steinbrenner insisted that Martin could only return to the Yankees if there was no conviction nor out-of-court settlement, and this occurred, though money likely changed hands behind the scenes. In the interim, the Yankees, under Lemon, had made a dramatic comeback to win the division, pennant and their second consecutive World Series over the Dodgers.

In 1979, the Yankees got off to a slow start under Lemon. Injuries to Jackson and Gossage, and key players proving less effective than the year before had the Yankees reeling. Steinbrenner fired Lemon on June 18 and brought back Martin. The Yankees failed to improve, and Munson's death in a private plane crash on August 1 devastated the team. The Yankees were 34–30 when Martin took over and finished 89–71, in fourth place. After the season, Martin got into a fight with <a href="marshmallow">marshmallow</a> salesman Joseph Cooper at a hotel in Minneapolis. Cooper alleged that he said that Martin should not have won his American League Manager of the Year award, which he believed should have gone to <a href="Dick%20Williams">Dick Williams</a> or <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a>. Martin, in his autobiography, replied by mocking Cooper's profession and in the process angered him to the point where Cooper challenged Martin to a fight. Martin responded by wagering $500 that he could beat Cooper and proceeded to do so. Steinbrenner fired Martin days later.

Martin did not get any immediate interest after being dismissed by the Yankees, but in February 1980 Oakland owner Charlie Finley sought to hire him. The A's had fallen far from their championship heyday of the early 1970s as Finley had refused to go along with the escalating salaries of free agency; in 1979, the team had lost 108 games. The job brought Martin back to his East Bay roots, but he also knew it might be his last chance, both because of the conflict that surrounded him, and because of his lack of success with the 1979 Yankees.

The 1980 A's had few standouts, and many of the young players were in awe of Martin: some who later became stars credited Martin with developing them. He had <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a> steal only on signs until Henderson learned how to read pitchers in their windup; then Martin turned Henderson loose. According to Pennington, "under Billy's tutelage, Henderson became the best leadoff hitter and base stealer in the history of Major League Baseball." Many in baseball were surprised to find the A's only 2 games behind the heavily favored Royals at the end of May. The A's finished second with an 83–79 record, 14 games behind the Royals, and Martin was given a Manager of the Year award. Attendance at the <a href="Oakland%E2%80%93Alameda%20County%20Coliseum">Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum</a> rose by 500,000, enabling Finley to sell the team at a better price.

The new owners, the Haas family, owners of <a href="Levi%20Strauss">Levi Strauss</a>, were inexperienced in baseball. They named Martin general manager, giving him complete control of the baseball side of the operation. Martin brought his aggressive style of play, which was dubbed "Billyball" by a sportswriter early in the 1981 season, and the name stuck. The A's began the season going 18–3, and Martin appeared on the cover of <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a>. He was applauded by baseball fans across the country even when he was kicked out of a game and suspended by the league for a week for kicking dirt on the umpire. The Oakland momentum was finally checked by the <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1981 Major League Baseball strike</a>, which shut down baseball for nearly two months midseason. The season was split into two halves, the division leaders at the time of the strike (in the AL West, the A's) to play the second-half winners (the Royals) in a <a href="1981%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">special division series</a>. The A's won in three straight games to face the Yankees in the <a href="1981%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1981 American League Championship Series</a>. The opportunity to beat the Yankees meant much to Martin, and Steinbrenner, seeing the Oakland success, was privately stating that he might have been too quick to fire Martin after the marshmallow salesman incident. But the veteran New York lineup and pitching staff was able to dominate the A's as the Yankees won the first three games to take the series. The A's finished a combined 64–45, the second-best record in baseball, and hopes were very high for 1981.

The 1982 season did not go as well for the A's, who never got much above .500. By July were well below .500, and a long way out of the pennant race. None of the starting pitchers matched their 1981 form, nor ever would, leading to accusations from baseball historians and statisticians that Martin abbreviated their careers by overusing them in 1981. In 2006, <a href="Rob%20Neyer">Rob Neyer</a> estimated that the four top starters from the 1981 team threw anywhere from 120–140 pitches per complete game—a heavy workload for pitchers that young. The A's went 68–94 and finished fifth, both the worst full-season records of Martin's managerial career.

Martin's behavior during the 1982 season concerned A's management; incidents included considerable drinking, traveling with a mistress while on the road, and trashing his own office after being refused a loan by the team to pay a tax debt. There has been speculation that Martin had been assured by Steinbrenner that he would be Yankee manager in 1983 if he could get himself fired by Oakland, and he may have been acting to that end. On October 20, 1982, three weeks after the A's season ended, Martin was fired with three years remaining on his contract.

The Yankees had finished fifth in 1982, their first losing record in the Steinbrenner era, doing so under three managers—Lemon, <a href="Gene%20Michael">Gene Michael</a> and <a href="Clyde%20King">Clyde King</a>—all fired by Steinbrenner.

On January 11, 1983, the Yankees announced that Martin had been hired as manager under a long-term contract: he would stay with the Yankees, though not always manager, for the rest of his life. Jackson had departed for the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a>, but other Yankees from Martin's earlier tenures remained, such as Randolph and <a href="Ron%20Guidry">Ron Guidry</a>, and the team had added strong players like <a href="Dave%20Winfield">Dave Winfield</a> and <a href="Don%20Baylor">Don Baylor</a>. Steinbrenner had pledged non-interference but, as the team struggled early in the season, resumed his second-guessing of Martin, both directly and by leak to the media. As relations between owner and manager deteriorated, Martin had conflicts with reporters and a brawl with a patron in an <a href="Anaheim">Anaheim</a> bar.

During the 1983 season, Martin was involved in one of the most controversial regular season games, known as the <a href="Pine%20Tar%20Incident">Pine Tar Incident</a>, when Martin challenged a home run by George Brett on the ground that the amount of pine tar on the bat broke the rules. Brett was ruled out and the home run disallowed; as this occurred with two out in the top of the ninth, it ended the game with the Yankees leading 4–3. American League President <a href="Lee%20MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a> ruled in favor of the Royals' protest. The game was resumed some weeks later with Kansas City leading 5–4 and two out in the top half of the ninth. At the start of the resumed game, Martin tried to protest on the grounds that Brett had missed a base. The umpires had anticipated this, and had obtained an affidavit from the crew who had worked the original game saying that Brett had indeed touched all the bases. The Yankees did not play as well during and after the distraction of the Pine Tar Game, and fell further behind the division-leading Orioles. The Yankees finished second, 91–71, seven games behind the Orioles. On December 16, Steinbrenner fired Martin as manager, but kept him under contract, giving him a scouting assignment.

Yogi Berra was the Yankee manager for 1984, and the team finished third, 17 games behind the Tigers. When, at the start of the 1985 season, Steinbrenner pledged that Berra would remain manager for the whole season, there was immediate speculation that Martin would return, which he did, Berra being dismissed after 16 games. Stated Martin, "George and I have the greatest relationship I've ever had with him." With an MVP season from <a href="Don%20Mattingly">Don Mattingly</a> and a strong effort from Rickey Henderson, who had been acquired by the Yankees, the team played well throughout the summer, coming to within a game and a half of the division-leading <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> on September 12. They then lost eight in a row, and as the Yankees fell out of the race, according to Pennington, "Martin seemed to melt down with it." On September 22, 1985, while at a hotel bar in Baltimore, Martin fought one of his pitchers, <a href="Ed%20Whitson">Ed Whitson</a>, who was larger, heavier and trained in martial arts. Martin suffered a broken arm. The Yankees recovered to win 97 games, but finished two games back of the Blue Jays, eliminated on the second to last day of the season. On October 27, 1985, Martin was fired again as Yankee manager, replaced by longtime Yankee player <a href="Lou%20Piniella">Lou Piniella</a>. Nevertheless, Steinbrenner, believing that Martin could again bring a championship to the Yankees and, fearing he might do so elsewhere, increased Martin's salary; the four-time manager of the Yankees turned down lucrative offers from the White Sox and Indians.

Steinbrenner kept Martin as a close advisor in 1986; he was formally part of the broadcasting staff under his <a href="personal%20services%20contract">personal services contract</a>, which the owner extended so that Martin was now earning over $300,000 per year, a sum he was unlikely to match as manager elsewhere. Steinbrenner had considerable affection for Martin and wanted him to be without financial worries. Martin had long wanted to see his number 1 retired by the Yankees, and seeking to keep his past and future manager happy, Steinbrenner agreed, and Billy Martin Day took place at Yankee Stadium on August 10, 1986. At the ceremony, during which the number was retired and Martin given a plaque in <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a>, he stated, "I may not have been the greatest Yankee to ever put on the uniform but I was the proudest."

New York finished second behind the Red Sox in 1986, but were never really in contention, and finished fourth in 1987. Piniella was asked to become general manager so that Steinbrenner could make Martin manager for a fifth time in 1988. Despite minimal expectations, Martin got the 1988 Yankees off to a good start, but on the night of May 7, was involved in a brawl at a Dallas-area nightclub in which he came out worst. Already foreseeing the end, and with marital troubles, on May 30, Martin was kicked out of a game against the A's, flinging dirt on umpire <a href="Dale%20Scott">Dale Scott</a>. Martin was suspended for three games and fined by the league, a punishment the umpire's association considered inadequate, and American League umpires stated that they would eject Martin as soon as he left the Yankee dugout. A month later, Steinbrenner fired Martin, citing "a combination of factors" in explaining his decision; Pennington suggested that while many Yankee fans took to <a href="talk%20radio">talk radio</a> in anger at Martin's firing, there was less outrage than there had been in the 1970s, and greater concern for Martin as a person. He became a special adviser to Steinbrenner, though in practice he had no duties and rarely visited New York.

The Yankees had played under .500 in 1988 with Piniella as manager, and at the end of the 1988 season, Steinbrenner fired him and hired <a href="Dallas%20Green%20%28baseball%29">Dallas Green</a>. The Yankees saw little success under Green in 1989, and he was fired in August, replaced by <a href="Bucky%20Dent">Bucky Dent</a>. Steinbrenner was unconvinced that Dent could lead the Yankees back to a championship, and planned to keep Martin close at hand in 1990, as manager-in-waiting should Dent falter. He apparently told Martin of this during a November meeting at Yankee Stadium, as Martin began to recruit coaches for a sixth managerial tenure with the Yankees.

Martin was still a special consultant to Steinbrenner when he was killed in a low speed <a href="single-vehicle%20accident">single-vehicle accident</a> on <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a> 1989. His vehicle ran into a drainage culvert near the entrance of the driveway to his farm in <a href="Port%20Crane">Port Crane</a>, north of <a href="Binghamton%2C%20New%20York">Binghamton, New York</a>. He was pronounced dead at a hospital in <a href="Johnson%20City%2C%20New%20York">Johnson City, New York</a>.

Also present in the vehicle that night was Martin's friend Bill Reedy, who had been drinking with Martin at a local bar, and who was seriously injured in the accident. Reedy at first stated that he had driven the vehicle with Martin the passenger but after learning that Martin had died, changed his story, saying that he had lied to protect Martin against the consequences of a drunk driving conviction. He was convicted in a jury trial of driving with a blood alcohol level of .10, was fined and his license suspended. A subsequent civil trial also found he was the driver. Golenbock, who wrote his book after the criminal trial but before the civil, was convinced that Martin was the driver. In this, he joined Martin's children and some of his close friends, like Mickey Mantle, who believed Martin would not have allowed another to drive him that night. Martin's biographers point to inadequacies in the police investigation. Pennington noted that those who believe Martin was the driver are the minority; Reedy was seen holding the car keys as the two left the bar, and the positions of the men when rescuers arrived pointed to Reedy being the driver. No autopsy was performed, allegedly due to opposition by Martin's widow and by Steinbrenner; <a href="Office%20of%20Chief%20Medical%20Examiner%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">New York City Medical Examiner</a> <a href="Michael%20Baden">Michael Baden</a> was allowed to examine the body.

Martin was eulogized by <a href="Cardinal%20John%20O%27Connor">Cardinal John O'Connor</a> at <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a>, before his interment at <a href="Gate%20of%20Heaven%20Cemetery">Gate of Heaven Cemetery</a> in <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20New%20York">Hawthorne, New York</a>. His grave is located about from <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s, in Section 25. The following epitaph, spoken by Martin at his <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">number retiring</a> ceremony at Yankee Stadium in 1986, appears on the headstone: "I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the uniform, but I was the proudest." Steinbrenner and former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States President</a> <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, along with many New York Yankee greats attended Martin's funeral service.

<a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> noted that "Billy Martin, of course, improved every team he ever managed in his first year in control, usually by huge margins. Within a year or two, all of those teams were ready to get rid of him." According to Chris Jaffe in his book evaluating baseball managers, "Martin was the perfect manager to hire if you wanted an immediate improvement and the worst manager for a team seeking sustained success." Part of this, Jaffe argued, was because Martin "would do whatever it took to win that day, and not worry about any negative side effects in the future", even if it meant a shortened career for his players. The subsequent ineffectiveness of the young starting pitchers on the 1981 A's is cited by Jaffe as one example of this; others include pitcher <a href="Catfish%20Hunter">Catfish Hunter</a>, who completed every game he started but one during Martin's partial season with the 1975 Yankees, and who was never the same pitcher after that year, and Ferguson Jenkins with Texas in 1974, who pitched 29 complete games for the Rangers, and who declined thereafter. A similar attitude permeated his use of relief pitchers: "he wanted who he wanted when he wanted without concern towards keeping their arms well rested."

In 1988, the <a href="Elias%20Sports%20Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a> proclaimed Martin the best manager in major league history, based on modeling that found that Martin's teams won 7.45 more games per year than they should have as predicted by statistics, higher than any other manager. Martin sought to catch the other team by surprise, using such techniques as stealing home—once having two Twins steal home on different pitches of the same at bat, with the slugger <a href="Harmon%20Killebrew">Harmon Killebrew</a> at the plate. Stealing home is a tactic unlikely to succeed, yet Martin made it work, and his teams got better. Jaffe noted that with Minnesota in 1969, Martin ended such risky tactics well before the end of the season, by which time he had set the tone he wanted both with his team, and with opponents. According to Jimmy Keenan and Frank Russo in their biography of Martin for the <a href="Society%20for%20American%20Baseball%20Research">Society for American Baseball Research</a> (SABR), "He played the game hard and made no excuses for the way he handled himself on or off the field. Many people, including his off-and-on boss, George Steinbrenner, considered Martin a baseball genius for the intuitive way he managed his teams."

Hall of Fame manager <a href="Tony%20La%20Russa">Tony La Russa</a> stated of him, "without reservation I would call Billy the most brilliant field manager I ever saw. He was unmatched. None of us felt up to him." Stengel stated in an interview a month before his death in 1975, "He’s a good manager. He might be a little selfish about some things he does and he may think he knows more about baseball than anybody else and it wouldn’t surprise me if he was right." When asked why he had admired Martin as a player, Stengel replied, "If liking a kid who never let you down in the clutch is favoritism, then I plead guilty." James deemed Martin the third-most successful manager of the 1970s, behind <a href="Sparky%20Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> and Earl Weaver, and the most controversial.

Falkner noted that what Martin wanted was "to win, period", and quoted him as saying, "I would play <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a>, <a href="Mussolini">Mussolini</a> and <a href="Hideki%20T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">Tojo</a> on my team if I thought it would help me win." Willie Randolph stated, "you always knew if you got to the eighth or ninth inning and you were tied or one run down, Billy would find a way to win". Falkner noted, "he wanted to win, that was all. And for the time he was in the game, everyone knew it. And he won." Jaffe suggested that the person Martin was most akin to was not any other baseball manager, but <a href="Hernando%20Cortez">Hernando Cortez</a>, the <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a> who burned his own ships after arriving in Mexico, forcing his soldiers to conquer or die. "That was Billyball, sixteenth century style."

Pennington believed that Martin was very much a person of his times: "In the age of several round-the-clock ESPN channels, the ceaseless chatter of sports talk radio, and omnipresent smartphone cameras, Billy could not exist. At least not as an employed baseball manager." Pennington suggested, though, that had Martin been born 20 years later, his friends would have confronted him about his drinking problem; in Martin's day, such things were more often ignored. Pennington believes Martin's reputation for brawling and drinking has kept him out of the Hall of Fame; even if other managers who are in the Hall, such as Weaver and <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a>, got into fights and drank sometimes to excess, they did not acquire the same reputation for those things as did Martin. Golenbock suggested that Martin's alcoholism, together with his pride in being a Yankee kept him in a relationship with Steinbrenner that kept him willing to try to manage the team again and again, despite the difficult relationship with the owner.

Martin was married four times and had two children, a daughter named Kelly Ann and a son named Billy Joe. His first marriage was to Lois Berndt, by whom he had his daughter. She divorced him in 1955, after he had contested the action for more than a year on the grounds that he was Catholic. He married Gretchen Winkler in 1961, by whom he had his son, and stayed married to her until 1979, when the two divorced. He was married a third time, to Heather Ervolino, while he was managing in Oakland, but was never faithful to her and eventually married his mistress, a woman named Jillian Guiver, in January 1988.

Martin and Steinbrenner appeared together in the series of "Tastes Great!...Less Filling!" commercials for <a href="Miller%20Lite">Miller Lite</a> beer. In one, filmed in 1978, during the final days of Martin's first stint with the Yankees, Steinbrenner fires Martin, who says, "Oh, not again". Within weeks, Martin was forced to resign over the "one's a born liar, and the other's convicted" statement. The commercial aired again in June 1979, following Martin's return to manage the Yankees a second time, but with Steinbrenner saying "You're hired."

In 1978, Martin played himself in the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> TV movie "". Martin was a guest ring announcer at the inaugural <a href="WrestleMania%20%281985%29">WrestleMania</a> in March 1985. On May 24, 1986, on the season finale of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>", co-host Martin was "fired" by <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> <a href="Lorne%20Michaels">Lorne Michaels</a> for being "drunk" in a skit, slurring his lines. In retaliation, Martin set the dressing room on fire, a staged scene set as a cliffhanger for the following season.

In 1978, Martin and <a href="sports%20agent">sports agent</a> Doug Newton opened "Billy Martin's", a <a href="western%20wear">western wear</a> <a href="boutique">boutique</a> in New York City. Newton bought out Martin in 1982, and the store remained open until 2010.

Pennington, writing over 20 years after Martin's death, noted, "Billy was beloved because he represented a traditional American dream: freedom. He lived independent from rules. He bucked the system ... He told his boss to shove it. Often." The biographer complained that Martin, in the era of video clips and ESPN, has been reduced to a caricature: the man who kicked dirt on umpires, battled with Reggie Jackson in a dugout and who was forever being hired and fired, something that ignores a record of achievement both as player and manager. Appel noted, "There was never a more prideful Yankee. Or a more complicated one.

James wrote, "I suppose one could say the same about Billy Martin or about Richard Nixon ... had he not been so insecure, he could have resisted the self-destructive excesses which gradually destroyed him". Pennington, who covered the Yankees as a newspaper reporter from 1985 to 1989, described Martin as "without question one of the most magnetic, entertaining, sensitive, humane, brilliant, generous, insecure, paranoid, dangerous, irrational, and unhinged people I had ever met". Golenbock, who co-wrote Martin's autobiography, said of him, "but because Billy was an alcoholic who drank and fought publicly, and because the man for whom he worked destroyed his reputation through constant public denigrations and firings, he may never join the hallowed hall where he should rightfully be placed next to his mentor, Casey Stengel."

<a href="Mike%20Lupica">Mike Lupica</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">Daily News</a>" wrote that "Yankee fans never seemed to see him drunk, or nasty, or as Steinbrenner's toady, the way others did. They looked the other way, again and again and again. They always saw him as Billy the Kid." Pennington noted that the new owners of Martin's farm sometimes find fans wanting to see where he died, or makeshift memorials by the roadside where the accident occurred. Martin's grave has remained well-visited by Yankee fans, sometimes before driving to the Bronx to take in a home game. Andrew Nagle, who oversaw the cemetery, stated "people want to leave some acknowledgement of what he meant to them ... we don't let go of the people that touched us ... It's the same with Billy Martin. People won't let him go. They won't forget him."

Marjory Stoneman Douglas

Marjory Stoneman Douglas (April 7, 1890 – May 14, 1998) was an American journalist, author, women's suffrage advocate, and conservationist known for her staunch defense of the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> against efforts to drain it and reclaim land for development. Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", she became a <a href="freelance%20writer">freelance writer</a>, producing over a hundred <a href="short%20story">short stories</a> that were published in popular magazines. Her most influential work was the book "" (1947), which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp. Its impact has been compared to that of <a href="Rachel%20Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s influential book "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>" (1962). Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami, enabling her to advance her causes.

As a young woman, Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> and <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> movements. She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old. For the remaining 29 years of her life she was "a relentless reporter and fearless crusader" for the natural preservation and restoration of <a href="South%20Florida">South Florida</a>. Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname "Grande Dame of the Everglades" as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida. She received numerous awards, including the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, and was inducted into several halls of fame.

Douglas lived to 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" in London stated, "In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas."

Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7, 1890, in <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, the only child of Frank Bryant Stoneman (1857–1941) and Florence Lillian Trefethen (1859–1912), a concert violinist. One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her "<a href="The%20Song%20of%20Hiawatha">The Song of Hiawatha</a>", at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe. She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>", which she kept well into adulthood until "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back". She visited Florida when she was four, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Hotel">Tampa Bay Hotel</a>. From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from <a href="Tampa">Tampa</a> to <a href="Havana">Havana</a>.

When she was six, Marjory's parents separated. Her father endured a series of failed entrepreneurial ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the Trefethen family house in <a href="Taunton%2C%20Massachusetts">Taunton, Massachusetts</a>. She lived there with her mother, aunt, and grandparents, who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father, to her dismay. Her mother, whom Marjory characterized as "high-strung", was committed to a <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">mental sanitarium</a> in <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a> several times. Her parents' separation and the contentiousness of her mother's family caused her to suffer from <a href="night%20terror">night terror</a>s. She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her "a skeptic and a dissenter" for the rest of her life.

As a youth, Marjory found solace in reading, and eventually she began to write. At sixteen she contributed to the most popular children's publication of the day, "<a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Magazine">St. Nicholas Magazine</a>"—also the first publisher of 20th-century writers <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Rachel%20Carson">Rachel Carson</a>, and <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>—with a puzzle titled "Double Beheadings and Double Curtailings". In 1907, she was awarded a prize by the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" for "An Early Morning Paddle", a story about a boy who watches a sunrise from a canoe. As her mother's mental health deteriorated, Marjory took on more responsibilities, eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance.

Marjory left for college in 1908, despite grave misgivings about her mother's mental state. Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns, but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life. She was a straight-A student at <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>, graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular success in a class on <a href="elocution">elocution</a>, and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates. She was elected Class Orator, but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.

After drifting with college friends through a few jobs to which she did not feel well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30 years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other matters. Douglas was married to Marjory while already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for <a href="fraud">passing a bad check</a>, she remained faithful to him. His scheme to <a href="scam">scam</a> her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and end the marriage. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation. Shortly before that, her father had married Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, a great-great-granddaughter of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (her grandfather was <a href="Francis%20W.%20Eppes">Francis W. Eppes</a>). Marjory later wrote that Shine "remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida."

Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5,000 people lived in Miami and it was "no more than a glorified railroad terminal". Her father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>". Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a>, and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">circuit judge</a>, Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman was referred to as "Judge" for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one.

Douglas joined the newspaper's staff in 1915. She began as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'". When her father went on vacation less than a year after her arrival in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at "<a href="The%20Miami%20Metropolis">The Miami Metropolis</a>" whose greater familiarity with Miami history gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.

Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman from Miami to join the <a href="US%20Naval%20Reserve">US Naval Reserve</a>. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas herself joined the Navy as a <a href="Yeoman%20%28F%29">Yeoman (F)</a> first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar, so she requested a discharge and joined the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a>, which stationed her in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the <a href="Rue%20de%20Rivoli">Rue de Rivoli</a> when the Armistice was signed and cared for war <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".

After the war, Douglas served as assistant editor at "The Miami Herald". She gained some renown for her daily column, "The Galley", becoming something of a local celebrity. She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem. "The Galley" was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose. She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami <a href="Florida%20land%20boom%20of%20the%201920s">saw a population boom</a> of 100,000 people in a decade. She wrote supporting women's suffrage, <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a>, and better sanitation while opposing <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> and foreign trade tariffs.

Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the region's wealth as being in its "inevitable development", and she supplemented her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life. In the early 1920s she wrote "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now", a ballad lamenting the death of a 22-year-old <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">vagrant</a> who was beaten to death in a <a href="labor%20camp">labor camp</a>. It was printed in "The Miami Herald", and read aloud during a session of the <a href="Florida%20Legislature">Florida Legislature</a>, which passed a law banning <a href="Convict%20lease">convict leasing</a> in large part due to her writing. "I think that's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I've written", she wrote in her autobiography.

After quitting the newspaper in 1923, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a> magazine "<a href="Black%20Mask%20%28magazine%29">Black Mask</a>" for $600 (equivalent to $ in 2018). Forty of her stories were published in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>"; one, "Story of a Homely Woman", was reprinted in 1937 in the "Post's" best short stories compilation. Recurring settings in her fiction were South Florida, the Caribbean, and Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent, quirky women or youthful underdogs who encountered social or natural injustices. The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings. "Plumes", originally published in the "Saturday Evening Post" in 1930, was based on the murder of <a href="Guy%20Bradley">Guy Bradley</a>, an Audubon Society game warden, by <a href="Poaching">poacher</a>s. "Wings" was a nonfiction story, also first appearing in the "Post" in 1931, that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers. Her story "Peculiar Treasure of a King" was a second-place finalist in the <a href="O.%20Henry%20Award">O. Henry Award</a> competition in 1928.

During the 1930s, she was commissioned to write a <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> supporting a <a href="botanical%20garden">botanical garden</a> called "An argument for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden in South Florida." Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area, then to serve on the board to support the <a href="Fairchild%20Tropical%20Botanic%20Garden">Fairchild Garden</a>. She called the garden "one of the greatest achievements for the entire area".

Douglas became involved with the <a href="Miami%20Theater">Miami Theater</a>, and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, "The Gallows Gate", was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts. With William W. Muir, husband of reporter <a href="Helen%20Muir%20%28reporter%29">Helen Muir</a>, she authored "Storm Warnings", a play loosely based on the life of mobster <a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a>. Some of Capone's henchmen showed up at the theater, "add[ing] an extra tingle for the audience that night", though no actual problems arose. Douglas wrote the foreword to the <a href="Work%20Projects%20Administration">Work Projects Administration</a>'s guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the <a href="Federal%20Writers%27%20Project">Federal Writers' Project</a>'s <a href="American%20Guide%20Series">American Guide Series</a>.

Douglas served as the book review editor of "The Miami Herald" from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the <a href="University%20of%20Miami">University of Miami</a> Press from 1960 to 1963. She released her first novel, "Road to the Sun", in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several nonfiction books on regional topics including Florida <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> and <a href="David%20Fairchild">David Fairchild</a>, a biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography, "Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River", was written with <a href="John%20Rothchild">John Rothchild</a> in 1987. She had been working on a book about <a href="W.%20H.%20Hudson">W. H. Hudson</a> for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.

Early in the 1940s Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the <a href="Rivers%20of%20America%20Series">Rivers of America Series</a> by writing about the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a>. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about "an inch long", but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher to allow her to write about them instead. She spent five years researching what little was known about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist <a href="Garald%20G.%20Parker">Garald Parker</a>, who discovered that South Florida's sole freshwater source was the <a href="Biscayne%20Aquifer">Biscayne Aquifer</a>, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the Everglades' essence, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.

"" was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing in a month. The book's first line, "There are no other Everglades in the world", has been called the "most famous passage ever written about the Everglades", and the line welcomes visitors to the <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a> website. Douglas characterized the Everglades as an ecosystem surrounding a river worthy of protection, inescapably connected to South Florida's people and cultures. She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter, "The Eleventh Hour":

Cattlemen's grass fires roared uncontrolled. Cane-field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke. Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette butts, and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before every wind leaving only blackness ... There was no water in the canals with which to fight [the fires] ... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or had shrunk far down into its strange holes and cleavages.

"The Everglades: River of Grass" galvanized people to protect the Everglades and has been compared to <a href="Rachel%20Carson">Rachel Carson</a>'s 1962 exposé of the harmful effects of <a href="DDT">DDT</a>, "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>"; both books are "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice". Its impact is still felt as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists, and "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades". It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000 copies since its original publication. The "<a href="Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" wrote of it in 1997, "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world". The downside of the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> of a River of Grass is so predominant that the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades is oversimplified. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas's "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.

Women's suffrage was an early interest of Douglas, and although she tended to shy away from polemics in her early work at "The Miami Herald", on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>'s wife, and two other women to <a href="Tallahassee%2C%20Florida">Tallahassee</a> to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to <a href="Idolatry">graven images</a>. They never paid attention to us at all." Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.

Using her influence at "The Miami Herald", Douglas wrote columns about poverty:

You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept ... but if you have a weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value.

In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or <a href="sanitary%20sewer">sewer</a>s were connected to the <a href="racial%20segregation">racially segregated</a> part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the <a href="referendum">referendum</a> passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.

Stoneman Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by <a href="Ernest%20F.%20Coe">Ernest F. Coe</a> and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969—at the age of 79—Douglas founded <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20Everglades">Friends of the Everglades</a> to protest the construction of a <a href="Environmental%20Impact%20of%20the%20Big%20Cypress%20Swamp%20Jetport">jetport in the Big Cypress</a> portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, "It is a woman's business to be interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping."

She toured the state giving "hundreds of ringing denunciations" of the airport project, and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3,000 within three years. She ran the public information operation full-time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport's developers and backers, who called her a "damn butterfly chaser". President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, however, scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups.

Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on <a href="Restoration%20of%20the%20Everglades">restoring the Everglades</a> after declaring that "Conservation is now a dead word ... You can't conserve what you haven't got." Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades. A coalition of <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, which served as the fresh water source for the <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">Miami metropolitan area</a>. She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, which, she claimed, was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.

Besides Big Sugar, Douglas spoke about the damage the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C&SF), run by former members of the Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. "What a liar I turned out to be!" remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement".

Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in attendance dropped his pen on the floor. As he was stooping to pick it up, Douglas stopped her speech and said to him, "Colonel! You can crawl under that table and hide, but you can't get away from me!"

In 1973, Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in <a href="Everglades%20City%2C%20Florida">Everglades City</a>, and was observed by John Rothchild:

Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like <a href="Scarlett%20O%27Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a> as played by <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes ... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.

Douglas was not well received by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County</a> named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, she was the only opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. "Can't you boo any louder than that?" she chided, eventually making them laugh. "Look. I'm an old lady. I've been here since eight o'clock. It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat," she told them. Later, she wrote, "They're all good souls—they just shouldn't be out there." Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.

Florida Governor <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a> explained her impact, saying, "Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life. She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement, she was a prophet, calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren."

Douglas also served as a charter member of the first <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> chapter organized in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect <a href="migrant%20workers%23United%20States">migrant farm workers</a> who were centered on <a href="Belle%20Glade%2C%20Florida">Belle Glade</a>, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor <a href="Bob%20Graham">Bob Graham</a> in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8 million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in <a href="Crandon%20Park">Crandon Park</a>. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.

Although Douglas grew up in an <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal</a> household, she described herself as agnostic throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial. Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers when her mother was dying. However, she credited the motivation for her support of <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> to her <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> paternal grandparents whose dedication to the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolition of slavery</a> she admired, and proudly claimed <a href="Levi%20Coffin">Levi Coffin</a>, an organizer of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>, was her great-great-uncle. She wrote that his wife was a friend of <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" fleeing slavery because Douglas' great-great-aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape. Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony, and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life, even after converting to Episcopalianism. Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen Muir suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas' use of "Friends" in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries.

As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents' separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors. Following her mother's death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at "The Miami Herald", in the 1920s, she suffered the first of three <a href="nervous%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>s.

Douglas suggested she had what she referred to as "blank periods" before and during her marriage, but they were brief. She connected these lapses to her mother's insanity. She eventually quit the newspaper, but after her father's death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown, when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming. She realized she had a "<a href="father%20complex">father complex</a>", explaining it by saying, "Having been brought up without him all those years, and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect".

Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades, Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. "To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there ... It's too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable", she wrote. Instead, she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity.

Despite Douglas' demure appearance—she stood at and weighed , and was always immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had an uncanny ability to get her point across. She was known for speaking in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" who interviewed and wrote several stories about Stoneman Douglas, wrote of her, "She had a tongue like a <a href="switchblade">switchblade</a> and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen." Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.

She enjoyed drinking <a href="Scotch%20whisky">Scotch</a> and <a href="sherry">sherry</a>; as friend and neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, "She would come up and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, and we would have another sherry. What fun she was." Novelist <a href="Hervey%20Allen">Hervey Allen</a> called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and the role of women in South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a>, electric stove, or dishwasher.

She was attached to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, she said she did not believe in <a href="extramarital%20sex">extramarital sex</a> and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying "I wasn't a wild woman". However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work. "People don't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways", she wrote in her autobiography.

Douglas began accruing honors in her early days writing for "The Miami Herald". In the 1980s, the awards became more prestigious, and her reactions to them mixed. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (now the <a href="Florida%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Florida Department of Environmental Protection</a>) named its headquarters in Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she considered a dubious honor. She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building. During her polite acceptance speech, she railed against <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and the then-Secretary of the Interior <a href="James%20G.%20Watt">James Watt</a> for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation. In 1986 the <a href="National%20Parks%20Conservation%20Association">National Parks Conservation Association</a> established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award, which "honor(s) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the <a href="National%20Park%20System">National Park System</a>". Despite blindness and diminished hearing, Douglas continued to be active into her second century, and was honored with a visit from <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of "The Everglades: River of Grass" in 1991. Instead of gifts and celebrations, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, resulting in over 100,000 planted trees across the state and a bald cypress on the lawn of the governor's mansion. The <a href="South%20Florida%20Water%20Management%20District">South Florida Water Management District</a> began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.

In 1993, when she was 103, President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> awarded Douglas the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the highest civilian honor granted by the United States of America. The citation for the medal read,

Marjory Stoneman Douglas personifies passionate commitment. Her crusade to preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation's respect for our precious environment, reminding all of us of nature's delicate balance. Grateful Americans honor the 'Grandmother of the Glades' by following her splendid example in safeguarding America's beauty and splendor for generations to come.

Douglas donated her medal to Wellesley College. Most of the others she received she stored at her home.

Douglas was posthumously inducted into the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> Hall of Fame in 1999, and the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a> in 2000. John Rothchild declared her a <a href="feminism">feminist</a> before the word existed. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a> made a papier-mâché bust of her with <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a> and <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> in <a href="Bart%20vs.%20Thanksgiving">an early episode</a> of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>".

Some of Douglas's stories were collected by <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: "Nine Florida Stories" in 1990 and "A River In Flood" in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas's short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her as an environmentalist but did not know about her career as a freelance writer. "Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove", McCarthy wrote in the introduction to "A River in Flood".

<a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas%20High%20School">A high school in Parkland, Florida</a>, was named after Marjory Stoneman Douglas when it opened in 1990, the year of her 100th birthday.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on May 14, 1998. John Rothchild, who helped write her autobiography, said that her death was the only thing that could "shut her up" and added, "The silence is terrible." <a href="Carl%20Hiaasen">Carl Hiaasen</a> eulogized her in "The Miami Herald", writing that "The Everglades: River of Grass" was "monumental", and praised her passion and her resolve; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a <a href="photo%20opportunity">photo opportunity</a>, she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.

The National Wildlife Federation described her as "a passionate, articulate, and tireless voice for the environment". Chairman of the Florida <a href="Audubon%20Society">Audubon Society</a> Ed Davison remembered her, saying, "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't give a lot of credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" She was aware of it, once saying, "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." Her ashes were scattered over the of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>.

In 2000, the <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples, Florida</a>-based composer Steve Heitzeg wrote a 15-minute orchestra piece, "Voice of the Everglades (Epitaph for Marjory Stoneman Douglas)", for the Naples Philharmonic. Heitzeg said, "She was outspoken, she was direct, she had the energy and belief to make the world a better place." Two South Florida public schools are named in her honor: <a href="Broward%20County%20Public%20Schools">Broward County Public Schools</a>' <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas%20High%20School">Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</a> and <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%20Public%20Schools">Miami-Dade County Public Schools</a>' Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School.

<a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas%20House">Douglas's cottage</a> in <a href="Coconut%20Grove%2C%20Miami%2C%20Florida">Coconut Grove</a> at 3744–3754 Stewart Avenue, was built in 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories there, and the City of Miami designated it an historic site in 1995, not only for its famous owner but also for its unique Masonry <a href="Vernacular%20architecture">Vernacular architecture</a>. After Douglas's death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the <a href="1926%20Miami%20Hurricane">1926 Miami Hurricane</a> and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in <a href="Coral%20Gables">Coral Gables</a>, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life-size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas's house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the <a href="Florida%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Florida Department of Environmental Protection</a>. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.

On April 22, 2015, while giving an <a href="Earth%20Day">Earth Day</a> speech in the Everglades, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> announced that <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Secretary</a> <a href="Sally%20Jewell">Sally Jewell</a> had designated the house a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>.



Douglas appears as a major supporting character in the 2014 point and click adventure "<a href="A%20Golden%20Wake">A Golden Wake</a>".

In "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" season 2 episode "<a href="Bart%20vs.%20Thanksgiving">Bart vs. Thanksgiving</a>" Lisa makes a centerpiece for the table that features Douglas as an empowering woman.

Maya Angelou

Maya Angelou (; born Marguerite Annie Johnson; April 4, 1928 – May 28, 2014) was an American poet, singer, memoirist, and <a href="civil%20rights%20activist">civil rights activist</a>. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.

She became a poet and writer after a series of occupations as a young adult, including fry cook, <a href="sex%20worker">sex worker</a>, nightclub dancer and performer, cast member of the opera "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>", coordinator for the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a>, and journalist in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> during the <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonization of Africa</a>. She was an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at <a href="Wake%20Forest%20University">Wake Forest University</a> in <a href="Winston-Salem%2C%20North%20Carolina">Winston-Salem, North Carolina</a>. She was active in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and worked with <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>. Beginning in the 1990s, she made around 80 appearances a year on the <a href="lecture%20circuit">lecture circuit</a>, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" (1993) at the <a href="first%20inauguration%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">first inauguration of Bill Clinton</a>, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> at the <a href="inauguration%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">inauguration of John F. Kennedy</a> in 1961.

With the publication of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as <a href="Biography%20in%20literature%23Autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as <a href="Racism%20in%20the%20United%20States">racism</a>, identity, family and travel.

Marguerite Annie Johnson was born in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, Missouri, on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. Angelou's older brother, Bailey Jr., nicknamed Marguerite "Maya", derived from "My" or "Mya Sister". When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' "calamitous marriage" ended, and their father sent them to <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps, Arkansas</a>, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson. In "an astonishing exception" to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> because the <a href="general%20store">general store</a> she owned sold needed basic commodities and because "she made wise and honest investments".

Four years later, the children's father "came to Stamps without warning" and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, "I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone." According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.

Shortly after Freeman's murder, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again. Flowers introduced her to authors such as <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="Douglas%20Johnson%20%28historian%29">Douglas Johnson</a>, and <a href="James%20Weldon%20Johnson">James Weldon Johnson</a>, authors who would affect her life and career, as well as black female artists like <a href="Frances%20Harper">Frances Harper</a>, <a href="Anne%20Spencer">Anne Spencer</a>, and <a href="Jessie%20Fauset">Jessie Fauset</a>.

When Angelou was 14, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again, who had since moved to <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland, California</a>. During World War II, Angelou attended the <a href="California%20Labor%20School">California Labor School</a>. At the age of 16, she became the first black female <a href="streetcar">cable car</a> conductor in San Francisco. She wanted the job badly, admiring the uniforms of the operators — so much so that her mother referred to it as her "dream job." Her mother encouraged her to pursue the position, but warned her that she would need to arrive early and work harder than others. In 2014, Angelou received a lifetime achievement award from the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials as part of a session billed “Women Who Move the Nation.”

Three weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson).

In 1951, Angelou married Tosh Angelos, a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers <a href="Alvin%20Ailey">Alvin Ailey</a> and Ruth Beckford. Ailey and Angelou formed a dance team, calling themselves "Al and Rita", and performed <a href="modern%20dance">modern dance</a> at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> so she could study <a href="African%20dance">African dance</a> with Trinidadian dancer <a href="Pearl%20Primus">Pearl Primus</a>, but they returned to San Francisco a year later.

After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub <a href="the%20Purple%20Onion">the Purple Onion</a>, where she sang and danced to <a href="calypso%20music">calypso music</a>. Up to that point she went by the name of "Marguerite Johnson", or "Rita", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion, she changed her professional name to "Maya Angelou" (her nickname and former married surname). It was a "distinctive name" that set her apart and captured the feel of her <a href="Calypso%20music">calypso</a> dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>". She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, "<a href="Miss%20Calypso">Miss Calypso</a>", which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film "<a href="Calypso%20Heat%20Wave">Calypso Heat Wave</a>", in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions.

Angelou met novelist <a href="John%20Oliver%20Killens">John Oliver Killens</a> in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the <a href="Harlem%20Writers%20Guild">Harlem Writers Guild</a>, where she met several major African-American authors, including <a href="John%20Henrik%20Clarke">John Henrik Clarke</a>, <a href="Rosa%20Guy">Rosa Guy</a>, <a href="Paule%20Marshall">Paule Marshall</a>, and <a href="Julian%20Mayfield">Julian Mayfield</a>, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized "the legendary" "Cabaret for Freedom" to benefit the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and "eminently effective". Angelou also began her pro-<a href="Fidel%20Castro">Castro</a> and anti-<a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> activism during this time.

In 1961, Angelou performed in <a href="Jean%20Genet">Jean Genet</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Blacks%20%28play%29">The Blacks</a>", along with <a href="Abbey%20Lincoln">Abbey Lincoln</a>, <a href="Roscoe%20Lee%20Brown">Roscoe Lee Brown</a>, <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, <a href="Louis%20Gossett">Louis Gossett</a>, <a href="Godfrey%20Cambridge">Godfrey Cambridge</a>, and <a href="Cicely%20Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a>. Also in 1961, she met South African freedom fighter <a href="Vusumzi%20Make">Vusumzi Make</a>; they never officially married. She and her son Guy moved with Make to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English-language newspaper "The <a href="Arab%20Observer">Arab Observer</a>". In 1962, her relationship with Make ended, and she and Guy moved to <a href="Accra%2C%20Ghana">Accra, Ghana</a> so he could attend college, but he was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965. She became an administrator at the <a href="University%20of%20Ghana">University of Ghana</a>, and was active in the African-American expatriate community. She was a feature editor for "<a href="The%20African%20Review">The African Review</a>", a freelance writer for the "<a href="Ghanaian%20Times">Ghanaian Times</a>", wrote and broadcast for <a href="Radio%20Ghana">Radio Ghana</a>, and worked and performed for Ghana's National Theatre. She performed in a revival of "The Blacks" in Geneva and Berlin.

In Accra, she became close friends with <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> during his visit in the early 1960s. Angelou returned to the U.S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization, the <a href="Organization%20of%20Afro-American%20Unity">Organization of Afro-American Unity</a>; he was assassinated shortly afterward. Devastated and adrift, she joined her brother in Hawaii, where she resumed her singing career. She moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career. Working as a market researcher in <a href="Watts%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Watts</a>, Angelou witnessed the <a href="Watts%20riots">riots</a> in the summer of 1965. She acted in and wrote plays, and returned to New York in 1967. She met her lifelong friend <a href="Rosa%20Guy">Rosa Guy</a> and renewed her friendship with <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called "my brother", during this time. Her friend <a href="Jerry%20Purcell">Jerry Purcell</a> provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing.
In 1968, <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> asked Angelou to organize a march. She agreed, but "postpones again", and in what Gillespie calls "a macabre twist of fate", he was assassinated on her 40th birthday (April 4). Devastated again, she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin. As Gillespie states, "If 1968 was a year of great pain, loss, and sadness, it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou's spirit and creative genius". Despite having almost no experience, she wrote, produced, and narrated "Blacks, Blues, Black!", a ten-part series of documentaries about the connection between <a href="blues">blues</a> music and black Americans' African heritage, and what Angelou called the "Africanisms still current in the U.S." for <a href="National%20Educational%20Television">National Educational Television</a>, the precursor of <a href="PBS">PBS</a>. Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin, cartoonist <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a>, and his wife Judy, and challenged by <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> editor <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, she wrote her first autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>", published in 1969. This brought her international recognition and acclaim.

Angelou's "<a href="Georgia%2C%20Georgia">Georgia, Georgia</a>", produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, the first screenplay written by a black woman, was released in 1972. She also wrote the film's soundtrack, despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> carpenter and ex-husband of writer <a href="Germaine%20Greer">Germaine Greer</a>, in San Francisco in 1973. Over the next ten years, as Gillespie has stated, "She [Angelou] had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime." Angelou worked as a composer, writing for singer <a href="Roberta%20Flack">Roberta Flack</a>, and composing movie scores. She wrote articles, short stories, TV scripts, documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry, produced plays, and was named visiting professor at several colleges and universities. She was "a reluctant actor", and was nominated for a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> in 1973 for her role in "Look Away". As a theater director, in 1988 she undertook a revival of <a href="Errol%20John">Errol John</a>'s play "<a href="Moon%20on%20a%20Rainbow%20Shawl">Moon on a Rainbow Shawl</a>" at the <a href="Almeida%20Theatre">Almeida Theatre</a> in <a href="London">London</a>.

In 1977, Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini-series "<a href="Roots%20%281977%20miniseries%29">Roots</a>". She was given a multitude of <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Maya%20Angelou">awards</a> during this period, including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. In the late 1970s, Angelou met <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> when Winfrey was a <a href="TV%20anchor">TV anchor</a> in Baltimore, Maryland; Angelou would later become Winfrey's close friend and mentor. In 1981, Angelou and du Feu divorced.

She returned to the southern United States in 1981 because she felt she had to come to terms with her past there and, despite having no bachelor's degree, accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of <a href="American%20Studies">American Studies</a> at <a href="Wake%20Forest%20University">Wake Forest University</a> in <a href="Winston-Salem%2C%20North%20Carolina">Winston-Salem</a>, North Carolina, where she was one of a few full-time African-American professors. From that point on, she considered herself "a teacher who writes". Angelou taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing. "<a href="The%20Winston-Salem%20Journal">The Winston-Salem Journal</a> "reported that even though she made many friends on campus, "she never quite lived down all of the criticism from people who thought she was more of a celebrity than an intellect...[and] an overpaid figurehead". The last course she taught at Wake Forest was in 2011, but she was planning to teach another course in late 2014. Her final speaking engagement at the university was in late 2013. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou actively participated in the lecture circuit in a customized tour bus, something she continued into her eighties.

In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at the presidential inauguration of <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s inauguration in 1961. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal "across racial, economic, and educational boundaries". The recording of the poem won a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>. In June 1995, she delivered what <a href="Richard%20A.%20Long">Richard Long</a> called her "second 'public' poem", titled "<a href="A%20Brave%20and%20Startling%20Truth">A Brave and Startling Truth</a>", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>.

Angelou achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996, "<a href="Down%20in%20the%20Delta">Down in the Delta</a>", which featured actors such as <a href="Alfre%20Woodard">Alfre Woodard</a> and <a href="Wesley%20Snipes">Wesley Snipes</a>. Also in 1996, she collaborated with <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> artists <a href="Ashford%20%26amp%3B%20Simpson">Ashford & Simpson</a> on seven of the eleven tracks of their album "Been Found". The album was responsible for three of Angelou's only <a href="Billboard%20charts">"Billboard" chart</a> appearances. In 2000, she created a successful collection of products for <a href="Hallmark%20Cards">Hallmark</a>, including <a href="greeting%20cards">greeting cards</a> and decorative household items. She responded to critics who charged her with being too commercial by stating that "the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as 'the people's poet'". More than thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story, she completed her sixth autobiography "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>", in 2002.
Angelou campaigned for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">in the 2008 presidential primaries</a>, giving her public support to <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. In the run-up to the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008">January Democratic primary in South Carolina</a>, the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou's endorsement. The ads were part of the campaign's efforts to rally support in the Black community; but <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> won the South Carolina primary, finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80% of the Black vote. When Clinton's campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Obama, who went on to win <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">the presidential election</a> and became the first African-American president of the United States. After Obama's inauguration, she stated, "We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism."

In late 2010, Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the <a href="Schomburg%20Center%20for%20Research%20in%20Black%20Culture">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</a> in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. They consisted of more than 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", a 1982 telegram from <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King">Coretta Scott King</a>, fan mail, and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis. In 2011, Angelou served as a consultant for the <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.%20Memorial">Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C. She spoke out in opposition to a paraphrase of a quotation by King that appeared on the memorial, saying, "The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit", and demanded that it be changed. Eventually, the paraphrase was removed.

In 2013, at the age of 85, Angelou published the seventh volume of autobiography in her series, titled "Mom & Me & Mom", which focuses on her relationship with her mother.

Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the <a href="Mende%20people">Mende people</a> of West Africa.. In 2008, a DNA test revealed that among all of her African ancestors, 45 percent were from the <a href="Congo%20Basin">Congo</a>-<a href="Angola">Angola</a> region and 55 percent were from <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. A 2008 <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child. After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite the discovery that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County <a href="poorhouse">poorhouse</a> in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother. Angelou described Lee as "that poor little Black girl, physically and mentally bruised".

The details of Angelou's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and "with no time chart in front of her". For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou held many jobs, including some in the <a href="sex%20trade">sex trade</a>, working as a <a href="prostitute">prostitute</a> and <a href="madame">madame</a> for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>". In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong.' They can’t forgive themselves and go on with their lives."

Angelou had one son, Guy, whose birth she described in her first autobiography; one grandson, two great-grandchildren, and, according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family. Angelou's mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson, Jr., died in 2000 after a series of strokes; both were important figures in her life and her books. In 1981, the mother of her grandson disappeared with him; finding him took four years.

In 2009, the gossip website <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis, which resulted in rumors of her death and, according to Angelou, concern among her friends and family worldwide. In 2013, Angelou told her friend Oprah Winfrey that she had studied courses offered by the <a href="Unity%20Church">Unity Church</a>, which were spiritually significant to her. She did not earn a university degree, but according to Gillespie it was Angelou's preference to be called "Dr. Angelou" by people outside of her family and close friends. She owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and a "lordly brownstone" in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>, which was purchased in 2004 and was full of her "growing library" of books she collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens. "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" writer <a href="Gary%20Younge">Gary Younge</a> reported that in Angelou's Harlem home were several African wall hangings and her collection of paintings, including ones of several jazz trumpeters, a watercolor of <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>, and a <a href="Faith%20Ringgold">Faith Ringgold</a> work titled "Maya's Quilt Of Life".

According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem; "her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend—from <a href="haute%20cuisine">haute cuisine</a> to down-home comfort food". "The Winston-Salem Journal" stated: "Securing an invitation to one of Angelou’s <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a> dinners, <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> decorating parties or birthday parties was among the most coveted invitations in town." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", describing Angelou's residence history in New York City, stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year's Day parties. She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book "<a href="Hallelujah%21%20The%20Welcome%20Table">Hallelujah! The Welcome Table</a>", which featured 73 recipes, many of which she learned from her grandmother and mother, accompanied by 28 vignettes. She followed up in 2010 with her second cookbook, "<a href="Great%20Food%2C%20All%20Day%20Long">Great Food, All Day Long</a>: Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart", which focused on weight loss and portion control.

Beginning with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play <a href="solitaire">solitaire</a>, "<a href="Roget%27s%20Thesaurus">Roget's Thesaurus</a>", and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10–12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She went through this process to "enchant" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>, "relive the agony, the anguish, the "<a href="Sturm%20und%20Drang">Sturm und Drang</a>"". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences such as her rape in "Caged Bird", in order to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. She said, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in "telling the truth".

Angelou died on the morning of May 28, 2014. She was found by her nurse. Although Angelou had reportedly been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances, she was working on another book, an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders. During her memorial service at Wake Forest University, her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure, she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life. He said, "She left this mortal plane with no loss of acuity and no loss in comprehension."

Tributes to Angelou and condolences were paid by artists, entertainers, and world leaders, including Obama, whose sister was named after Angelou, and Bill Clinton. <a href="Harold%20Augenbraum">Harold Augenbraum</a>, from the <a href="National%20Book%20Foundation">National Book Foundation</a>, said that Angelou's "legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to." The week after Angelou's death, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" rose to number 1 on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>'s bestseller list.

On May 29, 2014, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, of which Angelou was a member for 30 years, held a public memorial service to honor her. On June 7, a private memorial service was held at <a href="Wait%20Chapel">Wait Chapel</a> on the campus of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. The memorial was shown live on local stations in the Winston-Salem/Triad area and streamed live on the university web site with speeches from her son, Oprah Winfrey, <a href="Michelle%20Obama">Michelle Obama</a>, and Bill Clinton. On June 15, a memorial was held at <a href="Glide%20Memorial%20Church">Glide Memorial Church</a> in San Francisco, where Angelou was a member for many years. Rev. <a href="Cecil%20Williams%20%28pastor%29">Cecil Williams</a>, Mayor <a href="Ed%20Lee%20%28politician%29">Ed Lee</a>, and former mayor <a href="Willie%20Brown%20%28politician%29">Willie Brown</a> spoke.

On October 5, 2014, a major tribute entitled "Maya Angelou: A Celebration", scripted by <a href="Margaret%20Busby">Margaret Busby</a> and directed by <a href="Paulette%20Randall">Paulette Randall</a>, took place in London's <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>; chaired by <a href="Jon%20Snow%20%28journalist%29">Jon Snow</a> and <a href="Moira%20Stuart">Moira Stuart</a>, it featured contributions from artists including <a href="Adjoa%20Andoh">Adjoa Andoh</a>, <a href="Angel%20Coulby">Angel Coulby</a>, <a href="Chiwetel%20Ejiofor">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>, <a href="Nicola%20Hughes%20%28actress%29">Nicola Hughes</a>, Ella Odedina, NITROvox, <a href="Roderick%20Williams">Roderick Williams</a> and Ayanna Witter-Johnson.

In 2015 a <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> stamp was issued commemorating Maya Angelou with the <a href="Joan%20Walsh%20Anglund">Joan Walsh Anglund</a> quote "A bird doesn’t sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song", though the stamp mistakenly attributes the quote to Angelou. The quote is from Anglund's book of poems "A Cup of Sun" (1967). On April 4, 2018, Google presented a <a href="Google%20Doodle">doodle</a> to honor her 90th birthday.

Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's third autobiography "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" marked the first time a well-known African-American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life. Her books "stretch over time and place", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S., and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> She published her seventh autobiography "Mom & Me & Mom" in 2013, at the age of 85. Critics have tended to judge Angelou's subsequent autobiographies "in light of the first", with "Caged Bird" receiving the highest praise. Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> called her "wisdom books" and "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts". Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, an executive editor at <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>; he retired in 2011 and has been called "one of publishing's hall of fame editors." Angelou said regarding Loomis: "We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers."

Angelou's long and extensive career also included poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking. She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume "<a href="Just%20Give%20Me%20a%20Cool%20Drink%20of%20Water%20%27fore%20I%20Diiie">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie</a>" (1971) was nominated for the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>, and she was chosen by US President Bill Clinton to recite her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" during his inauguration in 1993.

Angelou's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, including her appearance in the television mini-series "<a href="Roots%20%281977%20miniseries%29">Roots</a>" in 1977. Her screenplay, "Georgia, Georgia" (1972), was the first original script by a black woman to be produced, and she was the first African-American woman to direct a major motion picture, "Down in the Delta", in 1998.


When "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote. Linguist <a href="John%20McWhorter">John McWhorter</a> agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called "tracts", as "apologetic writing". He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of black culture, which he called "a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period". Writer Julian Mayfield, who called "Caged Bird" "a work of art that eludes description", argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers, but also African-American autobiography as a whole. Als said that "Caged Bird" marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could, as he put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense". Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women. It made her "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer", and "a major autobiographical voice of the time". As writer Gary Younge said, "Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work."

Als said that "Caged Bird" helped increase black <a href="feminist">feminist</a> writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than "its resonance in the prevailing <a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>", or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world". Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that "Caged Bird" was "perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing" autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era. Angelou's poetry has influenced the modern <a href="hip-hop%20music">hip-hop music</a> community, including artists such as <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, <a href="Common%20%28rapper%29">Common</a>, <a href="Tupac%20Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>, and <a href="Nicki%20Minaj">Nicki Minaj</a>.

Reviewer <a href="Elsie%20B.%20Washington">Elsie B. Washington</a>, most likely due to President Clinton's choice of Angelou to recite her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" at his 1993 inauguration, called her "the black woman's poet laureate". Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300–600% the week after Angelou's recitation. <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>, which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand. They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase. Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, "I agree with <a href="Balzac">Balzac</a> and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money'." Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou's third book of essays, "<a href="Letter%20to%20My%20Daughter">Letter to My Daughter</a> "(2008), has said, "For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art—issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation."

Angelou's books, especially "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. According to the <a href="National%20Coalition%20Against%20Censorship">National Coalition Against Censorship</a>, parents and schools have objected to "Caged Bird"s depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence. Some have been critical of the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion. "Caged Bird" appeared third on the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list.

Angelou was honored by universities, literary organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups. Her honors included a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> nomination for her book of poetry, "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie," a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nomination for her role in the 1973 play "Look Away", and three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammys</a> for her spoken word albums. She served on two presidential committees, and was awarded the <a href="Spingarn%20Medal">Spingarn Medal</a> in 1994, the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Arts">National Medal of Arts</a> in 2000, and the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2011. Angelou was awarded over fifty honorary degrees.

Angelou's autobiographies have been used in <a href="narrative">narrative</a> and multicultural approaches in <a href="teacher%20education">teacher education</a>. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>, has trained teachers how to "talk about race" in their classrooms with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "Gather Together in My Name". According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to either explore their feelings about race and their own "privileged status", or to avoid the discussion as a means of keeping their privilege. Glazier found that critics have focused on the way Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her <a href="literary%20techniques">literary techniques</a>, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book "Stories of Resilience in Childhood", analyzed the events in "Caged Bird" to illustrate resiliency in children. He argued that Angelou's book has provided a "useful framework" for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using "Caged Bird" to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of <a href="child%20development">child development</a> topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found "Caged Bird" a "highly effective" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.

Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called "the black woman's poet laureate", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans. Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in "Caged Bird". According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the "liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon".

Many critics consider Angelou's autobiographies more important than her poetry. Although all her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied. Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry. Angelou's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Zofia Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".

Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth", which parallels the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> period of U.S. history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.
According to African-American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a> was able to dare her into writing "Caged Bird" by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered "high art". Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books "tracts" that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies "as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times". McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that "she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves". Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.

According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can be placed within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose "follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms". O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a "more expected ghetto expressiveness". McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is "cleaned up" for her readers. Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.

McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the "apologetic" nature of her writing. When Angelou wrote "Caged Bird" at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was "organic unity", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion. The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the <a href="Themes%20in%20Maya%20Angelou%27s%20autobiographies">themes of her books</a>, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that "Angelou's poetry and prose are similar". They both rely on her "direct voice", which alternates steady rhythms with <a href="syncopated">syncopated</a> patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird). According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. For example, she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry. In addition, she used the elements of <a href="blues%20music">blues music</a>, including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.

Tom Thomson

Thomas John Thomson (August 5, 1877July 8, 1917) was a Canadian artist active in the early 20th century. During his short career he produced roughly 400 <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a>es on small <a href="Panel%20painting">wood panels</a> along with around 50 larger works on canvas. His works consist almost entirely of <a href="Landscape%20painting">landscapes</a> depicting trees, skies, lakes, and rivers. His paintings use broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> landscape. Thomson's accidental death at 39 by drowning came shortly before the founding of the <a href="Group%20of%20Seven%20%28artists%29">Group of Seven</a> and is seen as a tragedy for <a href="Canadian%20art">Canadian art</a>.

Raised in rural Ontario, Thomson was born into a large family of farmers and displayed no immediate artistic talent. He worked several jobs before attending a business college, eventually developing skills in <a href="penmanship">penmanship</a> and <a href="Copperplate%20script">copperplate</a> writing. At the turn of the 20th century, he was employed in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> and <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> as a pen artist at several different <a href="photoengraving">photoengraving</a> firms, including <a href="Grip%20Ltd.">Grip Ltd.</a> There he met those who eventually formed the Group of Seven, including <a href="J.%20E.%20H.%20MacDonald">J. E. H. MacDonald</a>, <a href="Lawren%20Harris">Lawren Harris</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Varley">Frederick Varley</a>, <a href="Franklin%20Carmichael">Franklin Carmichael</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Lismer">Arthur Lismer</a>. In May 1912, he visited <a href="Algonquin%20Provincial%20Park">Algonquin Park</a>—a major public park and forest reservation in <a href="Central%20Ontario">Central Ontario</a>—for the first time. It was there that he acquired his first sketching equipment and, following MacDonald's advice, began to capture nature scenes. He became enraptured with the area and repeatedly returned, typically spending his winters in Toronto and the rest of the year in the Park. His earliest paintings were not outstanding technically, but showed a good grasp of <a href="Composition%20%28visual%20arts%29">composition</a> and colour handling. His later paintings vary in composition and contain vivid colours and thickly applied paint. His later work has had a great influence on Canadian art—paintings such as "<a href="The%20Jack%20Pine">The Jack Pine</a>" and "<a href="The%20West%20Wind%20%28painting%29">The West Wind</a>" have taken a prominent place in the <a href="culture%20of%20Canada">culture of Canada</a> and are some of the country's most iconic works.

Thomson developed a reputation during his lifetime as a veritable <a href="Outdoor%20enthusiast">outdoorsman</a>, talented in both fishing and <a href="canoeing">canoeing</a>, although his skills in the latter have been contested. The circumstances of his drowning on <a href="Canoe%20Lake%20%28Nipissing%20District%29">Canoe Lake</a> in Algonquin Park, linked with his image as a master canoeist, led to unsubstantiated but persistent rumours that he had been murdered or committed suicide.

Although he died before the formal establishment of the Group of Seven, Thomson is often considered an unofficial member. His art is typically exhibited with the rest of the Group's, nearly all of which remains in Canada—mainly at the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> in Toronto, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Canada">National Gallery of Canada</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, the <a href="McMichael%20Canadian%20Art%20Collection">McMichael Canadian Art Collection</a> in <a href="Kleinburg">Kleinburg</a> and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in <a href="Owen%20Sound">Owen Sound</a>.

Thomas John "Tom" Thomson was born in <a href="Claremont%2C%20Ontario">Claremont, Ontario</a>, the sixth of John and Margaret Thomson's ten children. He was raised in <a href="Leith%2C%20Ontario">Leith</a>, Ontario, near <a href="Owen%20Sound">Owen Sound</a>, in the municipality of <a href="Meaford%2C%20Ontario">Meaford</a>. Thomson and his siblings enjoyed both drawing and painting, although he did not immediately display any major talents. He was eventually taken out of school for a year because of ill health, including a respiratory problem variously described as "weak lungs" or "inflammatory <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>". This gave him free time to explore the woods near his home and develop an appreciation of nature.

The family were unsuccessful as farmers; both Thomson and his father often abandoned their chores to go hiking, hunting and fishing. Thomson regularly went on walks with Dr. William Brodie (1831–1909), his grandmother's first cousin. Brodie was a well-known <a href="Entomology">entomologist</a>, <a href="Ornithology">ornithologist</a> and <a href="Botany">botanist</a>, and Thomson's sister Margaret later recounted that they collected specimens on long walks together.

Thomson was also enthusiastic about sports, once breaking his toe while playing football. He was an excellent swimmer and fisherman, inheriting his passion for the latter from his grandfather and father. Like most of those in his community, he regularly attended church. Some stories say that he sketched in the hymn books during services and entertained his sisters with caricatures of their neighbours. His sisters later said that they had fun "guessing who they were", indicating that he was not necessarily adept at capturing people's likeness.

Each of Thomson's nine siblings received an inheritance from their paternal grandfather. Thomson received $2000 in 1898 but seems to have spent it quickly. A year later, he entered a machine shop apprenticeship at an iron foundry owned by William Kennedy, a close friend of his father, but left only eight months later. Also in 1899, he volunteered to fight in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, but was turned down because of a medical condition. He tried to enlist for the Boer War three times in all, but was denied each time.

In 1901, Thomson enrolled at Canada Business College in <a href="Chatham%E2%80%93Kent">Chatham</a>, Ontario. The school advertised instruction in <a href="shorthand">stenography</a>, <a href="bookkeeping">bookkeeping</a>, <a href="business%20correspondence">business correspondence</a> and "plain and ornamental <a href="penmanship">penmanship</a>". There, he developed abilities in penmanship and <a href="copperplate%20script">copperplate</a>—necessary skills for a clerk. After graduating at the end of 1901, he travelled briefly to <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> before leaving for <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> in January 1902, joining his older brother, George Thomson. George and cousin F. R. McLaren had established the Acme Business School in Seattle, listed as the 11th largest business school in the United States. Thomson worked briefly as an elevator operator at <a href="The%20Diller%20Hotel">The Diller Hotel</a>. By 1902, two more of his brothers, Ralph and Henry, had moved west to join the family's new school.

After studying at the business school for six months, Thomson was hired at Maring & Ladd as a pen artist, <a href="Drafter">draftsman</a> and <a href="Etching">etcher</a>. He mainly produced business cards, brochures and posters, as well as <a href="CMYK%20color%20model">three-colour printing</a>. Having previously learned <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting. While working at Maring & Ladd, he was known to be stubborn; his brother Fraser wrote that, instead of completing his work according to the direction provided, he would use his own design ideas, which angered his boss. Thomson may have also worked as a <a href="Freelancer">freelance</a> commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work.

He eventually moved on to a local engraving company. Despite a good salary he left by the end of 1904. He quickly returned to Leith, possibly prompted by a rejected marriage proposal after his brief summer romance with <a href="Alice%20Elinor%20Lambert">Alice Elinor Lambert</a>. Lambert, who never married, later became a writer; in one of her stories, she describes a young girl who refuses an artist's proposal and later regrets her decision.

Thomson moved to Toronto in the summer of 1905. His first job upon his return to Canada was at the photo-engraving firm Legg Brothers, earning $11 a week. He spent his free time reading poetry and going to concerts, the theatre and sporting events. In a letter to an aunt, he wrote, "I love poetry best." Friends described him during this time as "periodically erratic and sensitive, with fits of unreasonable despondency". Apart from buying art supplies, he spent his money on expensive clothes, fine dining and tobacco. Around this time, he may have studied briefly with <a href="William%20Cruikshank%20%28painter%29">William Cruikshank</a>, a British artist who taught at the <a href="OCAD%20University">Ontario College of Art</a>. Cruikshank was likely Thomson's only art instructor.

In 1908 or 1909, Thomson joined <a href="Grip%20Ltd.">Grip Ltd.</a>, a firm in Toronto that specialized in design and lettering work. Grip was the leading graphic-design company in the country and introduced <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>, <a href="Steel%20engraving">metal engraving</a> and the <a href="CMYK%20color%20model">four-colour process</a> to Canada. Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that Thomson's early work at the firm was mostly in lettering and decorative designs for booklets and labels. He wrote that Thomson made friends slowly but eventually found similar interests to his coworkers. Several of the employees at Grip had been members of the Toronto Art Students' League, a group of newspaper artists, illustrators and commercial artists active between 1886 and 1904. The members sketched in parts of <a href="eastern%20Canada">eastern Canada</a> and published an annual calendar with illustrations depicting Canadian history and rural life.

The senior artist at Grip, <a href="J.%20E.%20H.%20MacDonald">J. E. H. MacDonald</a>, encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills. It was at Grip that many of the eventual members of the <a href="Group%20of%20Seven%20%28artists%29">Group of Seven</a> would meet. In December 1910, artist William Smithson Broadhead was hired, joined by <a href="Arthur%20Lismer">Arthur Lismer</a> in February 1911. Robson eventually hired <a href="Frederick%20Varley">Frederick Varley</a>, followed by <a href="Franklin%20Carmichael">Franklin Carmichael</a> in April 1911. Although Thomson was not himself a member, it was at the <a href="The%20Arts%20and%20Letters%20Club%20of%20Toronto">Arts and Letters Club</a> that MacDonald introduced Thomson to <a href="Lawren%20Harris">Lawren Harris</a>. The club was considered the "centre of living culture in Toronto", providing an informal environment for the artistic community. Every member of what would become the original Group of Seven had now met. MacDonald left Grip in November 1911 to do freelance work and spend more time painting, after the Ontario government purchased his canvas "By the River (Early Spring)" (1911).

<a href="Algonquin%20Provincial%20Park">Algonquin Park</a> was established in 1893 by <a href="Oliver%20Mowat">Oliver Mowat</a> and the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario">Ontario Legislature</a>. Covering eighteen rectangular townships in <a href="Central%20Ontario">Central Ontario</a>, the Park was created to provide a space dedicated to recreation, wildlife and watershed protection, though logging operations continued to be permitted. Thomson learned of the Park from fellow artist Tom McLean. In May 1912, aged 34, he first visited the Park, venturing through the area on a canoe trip with his Grip colleague H. B. (Ben) Jackson. Together, they took the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Railway">Grand Trunk Railway</a> from Toronto to Scotia Junction, then transferred to the <a href="Ottawa%2C%20Arnprior%20and%20Parry%20Sound%20Railway">Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway</a>, arriving at <a href="Canoe%20Lake%20%28Nipissing%20District%29">Canoe Lake</a> Station. McLean introduced Thomson to the Park superintendent, G. W. Barlett. Thomson and Jackson later met ranger Harry (Bud) Callighen while they camped nearby on Smoke Lake.

It was also at this time that Thomson acquired his first sketching equipment. He did not yet take painting seriously. According to Jackson, Thomson did not think "his work would ever be taken seriously; in fact, he used to chuckle over the idea". Instead, they spent most of their time fishing, except for "a few notes, skylines and colour effects".

During the same trip, Thomson read <a href="Izaak%20Walton">Izaak Walton</a>'s 1653 fishing guide "<a href="The%20Compleat%20Angler">The Compleat Angler</a>". Primarily a fisherman's bible, the book also provided a philosophy of how to live, similar to the one described in <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>'s 1854 book "<a href="Walden">Walden, or Life in the Woods</a>", a reflection on <a href="simple%20living">simple living</a> in natural surroundings. His time in Algonquin Park gave him an ideal setting to imitate Walton's "contemplative" life. Ben Jackson wrote:

Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the "<a href="The%20Toronto%20World">Toronto Sunday World</a>", included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the <a href="Spanish%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Spanish River</a> and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today <a href="Mississagi%20Provincial%20Park">Mississagi Provincial Park</a>). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.

In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him "a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success "was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress. Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies ... Tom Thomson, so far as I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park."
In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. <a href="James%20MacCallum">James MacCallum</a>. A frequent visitor to the <a href="Ontario%20Society%20of%20Artists">Ontario Society of Artists</a>' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as <a href="John%20William%20Beatty">John William Beatty</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Heming">Arthur Heming</a>, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to <a href="A.%20Y.%20Jackson">A. Y. Jackson</a>, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to "take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage." MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their "truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places." He described Thomson's paintings as "dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.

Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: "The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty." He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the <a href="Mattagami%20First%20Nation">Mattagami reserve</a>. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few weeks in the Park the previous year. Thomson became as familiar with logging scenes as with nature in the Park and painted them both.

While returning to Toronto in November 1912, Thomson stopped in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Ontario">Huntsville</a>. The visit was possibly to meet with Winfred Trainor, a woman whose family owned a cottage on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. Trainor was later rumoured to have been engaged to Thomson with a wedding planned for the late 1917, although little is known about their relationship.

Thomson first exhibited with the OSA in March 1913, selling his painting "Northern Lake" (1912–13) to the <a href="Government%20of%20Ontario">Ontario Government</a> for $250 (). The sale afforded him time to paint and sketch through the summer and fall of 1913.

Thomson often experienced self-doubt. A. Y. Jackson recalled that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration, and was "so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches". Harris expressed similar sentiments, writing that Thomson "had no opinion of his own work", and would even throw burnt matches at his paintings. Several of the canvases he sent to exhibitions remained unsigned. If someone praised one of his sketches, he immediately gave it to them as a gift. A turning point in his career came in 1914, when the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Canada">National Gallery of Canada</a>, under the directorship of Eric Brown, began to acquire his paintings. Although the money was not enough to live on, the recognition was unheard of for an unknown artist.

For several years he shared a studio and living quarters with fellow artists, initially living in the <a href="Studio%20Building%20%28Toronto%29">Studio Building</a> with Jackson in January 1914. Jackson described the Studio Building as "a lively centre for new ideas, experiments, discussions, plans for the future and visions of an art inspired by the Canadian countryside". It was there that Thomson, "after much self-deprecation, finally submitted to becoming a full-time artist". They split the rent—$22 a month—on the ground floor while construction on the rest of the building was finished. After Jackson moved out in December to go to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Carmichael took his place. Thomson and Carmichael shared a studio space through the winter. On March 3, 1914, Thomson was nominated as a member of the OSA by Lismer and T. G. Greene. He was elected on the 17th. He did not participate in any of their activities beyond sending paintings for annual exhibitions. Harris described Thomson's strange working hours years later:

In late April 1914, Thomson arrived in Algonquin Park, where he was joined by Lismer on May 9. They camped on Molly's Island in Smoke Lake, travelling to Canoe, Smoke, Ragged, Crown and Wolf Lakes. He spent his spring and summer divided between <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a> and Algonquin Park, visiting James MacCallum by canoe. His travels during this time have proved difficult to discern, with such a large amount of ground covered in such a short time, painting the <a href="French%20River%20%28Ontario%29">French River</a>, <a href="Byng%20Inlet%20%28Ontario%29">Byng Inlet</a>, <a href="Parry%20Sound%2C%20Ontario">Parry Sound</a> and Go-Home Bay from May 24 through August 10. H. A. Callighen, a park ranger, wrote in his journal that Thomson and Lismer left Algonquin Park on May 24. By May 30, Thomson was at Parry Sound and on June 1 was camped at the French River with MacCallum.

Art historian <a href="Joan%20Murray%20%28art%20historian%29">Joan Murray</a> noted that Thomson was at Go-Home Bay for the next two months, or at least until August 10 when he was seen again in Algonquin Park by Callighan. According to Wadland, if this timeline is correct, it would require "an extraordinary canoeist ... The difficulty is augmented by the fact of stopping to sketch at intervals along the way." Wadland suggested that Thomson may have travelled by train at some point and by <a href="steamship">steamship</a> thereafter. Addison and Harwood instead said that Thomson had found much of the inland "monotonously flat" and the rapids "ordinary". Wadland found this characterization unhelpful, pointing out that the rapids Thomson had faced were hardly "ordinary".

MacCallum provided specific dates for two of Thomson's paintings—May 30 and June 1 for "" and "", respectively. These are some of the only instances of precise dating for his work. "Cottage on a Rocky Shore" is a depiction of MacCallum's cottage contrasted with the vast expanse of sky and water. "" is of a nearby island MacCallum took Thomson to visit. He continued to paint around the islands until he departed, probably because he found MacCallum's cottage too demanding socially, writing to Varley that it was "too much like north Rosedale".

Thomson continued canoeing alone until he met with A. Y. Jackson at Canoe Lake in mid-September. Though <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> had erupted that year, he and Jackson went on a canoe trip, in October meeting up with Varley and his wife Maud, as well as Lismer and his wife Esther, and daughter Marjorie. This marked the first time three Group of Seven members painted together, and the only time they worked with Thomson. In his 1958 autobiography, "A Painter's Country", A. Y. Jackson wrote that, "Had it not been for the war, the Group [of Seven] would have formed several years earlier and it would have included Thomson."

Why Thomson did not serve in the war has been debated. Mark Robinson and Thomson's family said that he was turned down after multiple attempts to enlist, likely due to his poor health and age but also possibly because he had <a href="flat%20feet">flat feet</a>. Blodwen Davies wrote that Thomson's artist friends tried to convince him to not risk his life, but he decided to secretly volunteer anyway. Andrew Hunter has found this scenario to be improbable, especially given that other artist friends "did" volunteer for the war, such as A. Y. Jackson. Thomson's sister suggested that he was a pacifist and that "he hated war and said simply in 1914 that he never would kill anyone but would like to help in a hospital, if accepted". William Colgate wrote that Thomson "brooded much upon" the war and that "he himself did not enlist. Rumour has it that he tried, and failed to pass the doctor. This is doubtful." Edward Godin, a companion, said "We had many discussions on the war. As I remember it he did not think that Canada should be involved. He was very outspoken in his opposition to Government patronage. Especially in the Militia. I do not think that we would offer himself for service. I know up until that time he had not tried to enlist." There is only one verifiable example of Thomson's opinion on the war, taken from a letter he wrote to J. E. H. MacDonald in 1915:

With MacCallum's year of financial support over, Thomson's financial future became uncertain. He briefly looked into applying for a position as a park ranger, but balked after seeing that it could take months for the application to go through. Instead, he considered working in an engraving shop over the winter. He made little effort to sell his paintings, preferring to give them away, though he brought in some money from the paintings he sold. In mid-November, he donated "In Algonquin Park" to an exhibition organized to raise money for the <a href="Canadian%20Patriotic%20Fund">Canadian Patriotic Fund</a>. It was sold to Marion Long for $50 ().

In the spring of 1915, Thomson returned to Algonquin Park earlier than he had in any previous year and had already painted twenty-eight sketches by April 22. From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes, and sketching when he had time. In July, he was invited to send paintings to the <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> Provincial Exhibition in September. Because he was in Algonquin Park, his friends selected three works to send—two unidentified works from 1914 and the sketch "Canadian Wildflowers". From the end of September to mid-October, he spent his time at Mowat, a village on the north end of Canoe Lake. By November, he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb. In late November, he returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him, renting it for $1 a month.

In 1915, MacCallum commissioned MacDonald, Lismer and Thomson to paint decorative panels for his cottage on Go-Home Bay. In October of that year, MacDonald went up to take dimensions. Thomson produced four panels which were probably meant to go over the windows. In April 1916, when MacDonald and Lismer went to install them, they found that MacDonald's measurements were incorrect and the panels did not fit.

In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: "In the Northland" (at that time titled "The Birches"), "<a href="Spring%20Ice">Spring Ice</a>", "Moonlight" and "October" (then titled "The Hardwoods"), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase "In the Northland", but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase "Spring Ice" instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Daily Star</a>" wrote, "Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper." A more favourable take came from artist <a href="Edmund%20Wyly%20Grier">Wyly Grier</a> in "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>":

In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left, Harris and Thomson paddled together to Aura Lee Lake. Thomson produced many sketches which varied in composition, although they all had vivid colour and thickly-applied paint. MacCallum was present when he painted his "Sketch for "The Jack Pine"", writing that the tree fell over onto Thomson before the sketch was completed. He added that Harris thought the tree killed Thomson, "but he sprang up and continued painting".

At the end of May, Thomson took a job as a fire ranger stationed at <a href="Achray%2C%20Ontario">Achray</a> on <a href="Grand%20Lake%20%28Nipissing%29">Grand Lake</a> with Ed Godin. He followed the <a href="John%20Rudolphus%20Booth%23Lumber">Booth Lumber Company</a>'s <a href="Log%20driving">log drive</a> down the <a href="Petawawa%20River">Petawawa River</a> to the north end of the park. He found that fire ranging and painting did not mix well together, writing, "[I] have done very little sketching this summer as the two jobs don't fit in... When we are travelling two go together, one for canoe and the other the pack. And there's no place for a sketch outfit when your fire ranging. We are not fired yet but I am hoping to get put off right away." He likely returned to Toronto in late October or early November.

Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career, with Thomson writing in a letter that he "got quite a lot done". Despite this, he did not submit any paintings to the OSA exhibition in the spring of 1917. It was during this time that he produced many of his most famous works, including "<a href="The%20Jack%20Pine">The Jack Pine</a>" and "<a href="The%20West%20Wind%20%28painting%29">The West Wind</a>". Dr. MacCallum suggested that several canvas works were unfinished, including "Woodland Waterfall", "The Pointers" and "The Drive". <a href="Barker%20Fairley">Barker Fairley</a> similarly described "The West Wind" as unfinished. Charles Hill has written that there are no reasons to believe "Woodland Waterfall" was unfinished. Similarly, while it has sometimes been suggested that "The Drive" was modified after Thomson's death, a reproduction from 1918 displays no discernible differences.

Thomson returned to Canoe Lake at the beginning of April, arriving early enough to paint the remaining snow and the ice breaking up on the surrounding lakes. He had little money but wrote that he could manage for about a year. On April 28, 1917, he received a guide's licence. Unlike previous years, he remained at Mowat with Lieutenant Crombine and his wife, Daphne. Thomson invited Daphne Crombie to select something from his spring sketches as a gift, and she selected "".

Besides the deep love he had come to develop for Algonquin Park, Thomson was beginning to show an eagerness to depict areas beyond the park and explore other northern subjects. In an April 1917 letter to his brother-in-law, he wrote that he was considering taking the <a href="Canadian%20Northern%20Railway">Canadian Northern Railway</a> west so he could paint the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a> in July and August. A. Y. Jackson suggested Thomson would have traveled even further north, just as the other members of the Group of Seven eventually did.

On July 8, 1917, Thomson disappeared during a canoeing trip on Canoe Lake. His upturned canoe was spotted later in the afternoon, and his body was discovered in the lake eight days later. It was noted that he had a four-inch cut on his right temple and had bled from his right ear. The cause of death was officially determined to be "accidental drowning". The day after the body was discovered, it was interred in Mowat Cemetery near Canoe Lake. Under the direction of Thomson's older brother George, the body was exhumed two days later, and re-interred on July 21 in the family plot beside the <a href="Leith%2C%20Ontario">Leith Presbyterian Church</a> in what is now the Municipality of <a href="Meaford%2C%20Ontario">Meaford, Ontario</a>.

In September 1917, J. E. H. MacDonald and John William Beatty erected a memorial <a href="cairn">cairn</a> at Hayhurst Point on Canoe Lake, to honour Thomson where he died.

There has been much speculation about the circumstances of Thomson's death, including that he was murdered or committed suicide. Though these ideas lack substance, they have continued to persist in the popular culture. Andrew Hunter has pointed to Park ranger Mark Robinson as being largely responsible for the suggestion that there was more to his death than accidental drowning. Hunter expands on this thought, writing, "I am convinced that people's desire to believe the Thomson murder mystery/soap opera is rooted in the firmly fixed idea that he was an expert woodsman, intimate with nature. Such figures aren't supposed to die by 'accident.' If they do, it is like <a href="Grey%20Owl">Grey Owl</a>'s being exposed as an Englishman."

Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a <a href="graphic%20designer">graphic designer</a> with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to <a href="Algonquin%20Park">Algonquin Park</a> inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the <a href="McMichael%20Canadian%20Art%20Collection">McMichael Canadian Art Collection</a> in <a href="Kleinburg">Kleinburg</a> and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.

Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The <a href="patronage">patronage</a> of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European <a href="post-impressionist">post-impressionist</a>s such as <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement">Arts and Crafts</a> movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

Thomson's artwork is typically divided into two bodies: the first are the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around 50 larger works on canvas. The smaller sketches were typically done "<a href="en%20plein%20air">en plein air</a>" in "the North", primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall. Mark Robinson later recounted that Thomson usually had a particular motif he wanted to depict before going into nature to find a comparison. The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in <a href="Rosedale%2C%20Toronto">Rosedale, Toronto</a>. About a dozen of the major canvases were derived directly from smaller sketches. Paintings like "<a href="Northern%20River%20%28painting%29">Northern River</a>", "Spring Ice", "The Jack Pine" and "The West Wind" were only later expanded into larger oil paintings.

Sketches from 1913 and earlier use a variety of supports, including canvas laid down on paperboard, canvas laid down on wood and commercial canvas-board. In 1914, he began to favour the larger <a href="birch">birch</a> wood panels used by A. Y. Jackson, typically measuring around 21.6 × 26.7 cm (8½ × 10½ in.). From late 1914 on, Thomson alternated between painting on these inexpensive pieces of wood—some from crates, bookbinder's board, and other assorted sources—and composite wood-pulp boards.

Although the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Compared to the panels, they display an "inherent formality", and lack much of the "energy, spontaneity, and immediacy" of the original sketches. The transition from small to large required a reinvention or elaboration of the original details; by comparing sketches with their respective canvases, one can see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns. Although few of the larger paintings were sold during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at <a href="Wembley">Wembley</a> in <a href="London">London</a> in 1924, that eventually brought his work to international attention.

Described as having an "idiosyncratic palette", Thomson had exceptional control of colour. He often mixed available pigments to create new, unusual colours that, along with his brushwork, made his art instantly recognizable regardless of its subject. His painting style and the atmosphere, colours and forms of his work influenced the work of his colleagues and friends, especially Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald, Harris and Carmichael.

Thomson's most famous paintings are his depictions of pine trees, particularly "The Jack Pine" and "The West Wind". David Silcox has described these paintings as "the visual equivalent of a national anthem, for they have come to represent the spirit of the whole country, notwithstanding the fact that vast tracts of Canada have no pine trees", and as "so majestic and memorable that nearly everyone knows them". Arthur Lismer described them similarly, saying that the tree in "The West Wind" was a symbol of the Canadian character, unyielding to the wind and emblematic of steadfastness and resolution.

Thomson had a great enthusiasm for trees and worked to capture their forms, their surrounding locations, and the effect of the seasons on them. He normally depicted trees as amalgamated masses, giving "form structure and colour by dragging paint in bold strokes over an underlying tone". His favourite motif was of a slight hill next to a body of water. His enthusiasm is especially apparent in an anecdote from Ernest Freure, who invited Thomson to camp on an island on Georgian Bay:

The theme of the single tree is common in Art Nouveau, while the motif of the lone, heroic tree goes back even further to at least <a href="Caspar%20David%20Friedrich">Caspar David Friedrich</a> and early <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romanticism</a>. Thomson may also have been influenced by the work of MacDonald while working at Grip Limited. MacDonald in turn was influenced by the <a href="landscape%20painting">landscape art</a> of <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>, whose work he likely saw while in England from 1903 to 1906. Constable's art influenced Thomson's as well, something apparent when Constable's "" () is compared with Thomson's "".

Thomson's earlier paintings were closer to literal renderings of the trees in front of him, and as he progressed the trees became more expressive as Thomson amplified their individual qualities. "Byng Inlet, Georgian Bay" shows the broken, high-keyed colour that Thomson and his colleagues experimented with later in his career, and is similar to Lismer's "Sunglow". While Lismer only applied the technique to the water, Thomson applied it throughout the composition. According to MacCallum, Thomson worked on "Pine Island, Georgian Bay" over an extended period. He wrote that this painting had "more emotion and feeling than any other of [Thomson's] canvases". In contrast, MacDonald found it "rather commonplace in color & composition & not representative of Thomson at his best".

Thomson was preoccupied with capturing the sky, especially near the end of his career from 1915 onward. Paintings like "Sunset"—which was painted at water level in a canoe—illustrate his excited brushstrokes in capturing the lake's reflection. The painting was done over a grey-green ground, adding depth to both the light of the sky and the reflecting water. Paintings from 1913 and on consistently utilize the perspective of the canoe, with a narrow foreground of water, a distant shoreline and a dominating sky.

The <a href="Lassen%20Peak%231914%E2%80%931921">1915 volcanic eruption</a> of <a href="Lassen%20Peak">Lassen Peak</a> in <a href="California">California</a> provided dramatic sunrises and sunsets in the northern hemisphere for the year. These skies provided artistic inspiration for Thomson and other artists in the same way that the <a href="1883%20eruption%20of%20Krakatoa">eruption of Krakatoa</a> in the previous century had inspired <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>. Sky effects were one of Thomson's main interests for the entire year, indicated by his heightened use of colour.

Harold Town has compared "Sky (The Light That Never Was)" to the works of <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>. In particular, he notes the way that the sky "[creeps] into the landscape, big rhythms supplanting small movement". The horizon disappears and pure movement is left behind.

Thomson produced more <a href="Nocturne%20%28painting%29">nocturnes</a> than the rest of the Group of Seven combined—roughly two dozen. MacCallum recalled that Thomson often spent his nights lying in his canoe in the middle of the lake, <a href="Amateur%20astronomy">stargazing</a> and avoiding mosquitoes. Besides capturing the nighttime sky, he also captured silhouettes of spruce and birch trees, lumber camps, two moose emerging from water and the northern lights, painting five different sketches of the <a href="aurora">aurora</a>.

Mark Robinson recounted that Thomson stood and contemplated the aurora for an extended period of time before going back into his cabin to paint by lamplight. He sometimes completed nocturnes this way, going back and forth between painting indoors and looking at the subject outside until he completed the sketch. Other times, given the difficulty of painting by moonlight, many of the nocturnes were painted entirely from memory. MacCallum confirmed that the sketch "Moose at Night" was completed in this way, writing on the back "Winter 1916—at studio", implying it was probably painted in Toronto. His moonlight paintings use a "dreamy, pale-toned style", applying the techniques of <a href="Impressionism">Impressionism</a> in his observations of light, reflection and atmosphere.

As was typical for painters of the early twentieth century, Thomson produced <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s of flowers, all of which appear in the form of sketches. His love of flowers may have developed from his father who, as a neighbour noted, had "a permanent half acre of a really good garden which was always worth going to see". Thomson's time spent as a child collecting samples with his naturalist relative Dr. William Brodie may have similarly influenced him, though his interest in painting flowers seems to have been more focused on patterning and decoration than on the horticultural specifics of the subject.

These paintings, especially "Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch" and "Wildflowers", are particularly powerful examples of the genre. J. E. H. MacDonald—himself deeply invested in floral imagery—was so captured by "Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch" that he kept it for himself, writing "Not For Sale" on the back. Thomson's work is contrasted from MacDonald's by what Joan Murray calls, "its elegant, slightly funky form and throwaway spontaneity." Lawren Harris instead noted "Wildflowers" as a favourite, writing "1st class" on the verso. The colour of the sketch is less brilliant, but has superb brushwork and is well coordinated, setting blues against yellows and reds against whites.

Responding to his subject with improvisation, every painting is different in its colour scheme and arrangement. In all the sketches, he redirected emphasis from the delicacy of the flowers towards simple broad strokes of colour, something Harold Town thought "[imparted] a toughness of design sometimes missing in his harder themes of rock and bracken". In "Water Flowers" particularly, the shapes are handled so summarily that the focus moves entirely to the colour of the flowers. This, combined with the black background, produces a more abstract effect. The black backdrop also causes the colours of the flowers to appear more vivid.

During Thomson's time in Algonquin Park, <a href="logging">logging</a> and the <a href="Wood%20industry">lumber industry</a> were a constant presence. He often painted the machinery left behind by lumber companies; Lismer, MacDonald and he were especially drawn to the subject. A. Y. Jackson wrote, 

Around 1916, Thomson followed the drive of logs down the <a href="Madawaska%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Madawaska River</a>, painting the subject in "The Drive". MacDonald similarly expressed the drive in his 1915 painting "". Besides the dams, <a href="Pointer%20boat">pointer</a> and <a href="alligator%20boat">alligator boat</a>s and log drives that appear in Thomson's work, other less obvious depictions of the lumber industry are evident. For example, areas cleared out due to logging appear in early sketches, such as "" (1913) and "". The painting "<a href="Drowned%20Land">Drowned Land</a>" similarly displays the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. As well, the white birches present in many paintings only thrive in "sunny, open areas whose previous tree cover had been removed", meaning that logging was in some way necessary for them to flourish.

Thomson's and the Group of Seven's work reflects the typical Canadian attitudes of the time, namely that the available natural resources were meant to be exploited. Harold Town has argued that, while Thomson was not directly critical of industry, mining and logging, he "did not glorify industry in the bush."

Thomson, like most of the members of the Group of Seven, rarely painted people. When he did, the human subject was usually someone close to him personally, such as the depiction of Shannon Fraser "In the Sugar Bush". Harold Town observed that both Thomson and Canadian artist <a href="David%20Milne%20%28artist%29">David Milne</a> "shared in common a similar inability to draw the human figure", something professor John Wadland thought was "embarrassingly evident" in several of Thomson's portraits. Thomson's most successful attempts at capturing people typically feature <a href="Staffage">figures far off in the distance</a>, allowing them to blend in to the scene. This is apparent in paintings like "Little Cauchon Lake", "Bateaux", "The Drive", "The Pointers" and "".

Town described paintings like "Man with Axe (Lowery Dixon) Splitting Wood" as stiff, yet still held together in a cohesive crudity. He described "Figure of a Lady, Laura" differently, interpreting it as a tender work, "well-designed and plainly expressed, this loving picture is so secure in intention that it survives, indeed triumphs, over the severe cracking of the paint". The figure in "The Poacher" is recorded deliberately, including his hat, hunting vest and blue shirt. The hot <a href="Barbecue%20grill%23Charcoal%20grills">coal grill</a> in front of him is drying his <a href="poaching">poach</a>—likely <a href="venison">venison</a>.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he "is the manifestation of the Canadian character". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Canada%23Directors">National Gallery of Canada Director</a> H. O. McCurry in 1930, "Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as "the" Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind." For Canadian artists <a href="Roy%20Kiyooka">Roy Kiyooka</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Lee%20%28author%29">Dennis Lee</a>, he is a "haunting presence" and "embodies the Canadian artistic identity".

As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was "", which sold in 2009 for <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CAD</a>$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost "". Discovered in an <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous <a href="art%20forgery">forgeries</a> on the market.

In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including <a href="Joyce%20Wieland">Joyce Wieland</a>. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Though best known for his painting, Thomson is often mythologized as a veritable <a href="Outdoor%20enthusiast">outdoorsman</a>. Dr. James MacCallum contributed stories to this image. He has often been remembered as an expert <a href="wikt%3Acanoeist">canoeist</a>, though David Silcox has argued that this image is romanticized. In the case of fishing, he was no doubt proficient. He had a deep love of fishing for his entire life, so much so that his reputation through Algonquin Park was equally divided between art and <a href="angling">angling</a>. Most who visited the Park were led by hired guides, but he moved through on his own. Many of his fishing locations appear in his work.

Gumbo

Gumbo () is Creole <a href="stew">stew</a> popular in the U.S. state of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, and is the official state dish. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored <a href="Stock%20%28food%29">stock</a>, meat or <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a>, a <a href="Thickening%20agent%23Food">thickener</a>, and what Louisianians call the <a href="Holy%20trinity%20%28cuisine%29">"Holy Trinity" of vegetables</a>, namely <a href="celery">celery</a>, <a href="bell%20pepper">bell pepper</a>s, and <a href="onion">onion</a>s. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether <a href="roux">roux</a>, <a href="okra">okra</a> or <a href="fil%C3%A9%20powder">filé powder</a> (dried and ground <a href="Sassafras%20albidum">sassafras</a> leaves). The dish derived its name from Africa meaning okra, which may have derived the name from a source such as the <a href="Choctaw%20language">Choctaw word</a> for filé ("kombo").

Gumbo can be made with or without okra or filé powder. The preferred method in the historical <a href="Cuisine%20of%20New%20Orleans">New Orleans variation</a> is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures. <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">Creole</a> gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, filé, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine. <a href="Cajun%20cuisine">Cajun</a> gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. <a href="Sausage">Sausage</a> or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over <a href="rice">rice</a>. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked <a href="leaf%20vegetable">greens</a>.

The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, German, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish <a href="bouillabaisse">bouillabaisse</a>, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator <a href="Allen%20Ellender">Allen Ellender</a>. The popularity of chef <a href="Paul%20Prudhomme">Paul Prudhomme</a> in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.

The name of the dish comes from Louisiana French. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the word "gumbo". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, <a href="okra">okra</a> or filé. In the <a href="Niger%E2%80%93Congo%20languages">Niger–Congo languages</a> spoken by many <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as "ki ngombo" or "quingombo"; the word is akin to the <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a> "ochinggômbo" and the <a href="Luba-Kasai%20language">Tshiluba</a> "chinggômbô" "okra". In the language of the native <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> people, filé, or ground <a href="sassafras">sassafras</a> leaves, was called "kombo".

Gumbo is a heavily seasoned soup or stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy. Any combination of meat or <a href="seafood">seafood</a> can be used. Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s occasionally added. Seafood-based gumbo generally has <a href="Shrimp%20and%20prawn%20as%20food">shrimp</a>, <a href="crab%20meat">crab meat</a>, and sometimes oysters. <a href="Andouille">Andouille</a> sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide "<a href="piquancy">piquancy</a>, substance, and an additional layer of flavor" to the dish. Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, <a href="parsley">parsley</a>, bell pepper, and celery. Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included.

Gumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: <a href="okra">okra</a>, <a href="fil%C3%A9%20powder">filé powder</a>, and <a href="roux">roux</a>. Traditionally, okra and filé powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken. Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat. This <a href="Mucilage">mucilaginous</a> vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to "The Oxford Companion to Food", okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as changing tastes have made the okra texture less palatable.

Ground sassafras leaf, known as filé, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source. If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too <a href="wikt%3Aropy">ropey</a>; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.

Roux has become the most popular thickener, made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog <a href="lard">lard</a>, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains. A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.

Gumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in <a href="Cuisine%20of%20New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> and southeastern Louisiana are known as "Creole" after the <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">Louisiana Creole people</a>, descendants of French and Spanish settlers, who lived in those areas. "Cajun" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by <a href="Cajun">Cajun</a>s, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from <a href="Acadia">Acadia</a> (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>) in the mid-18th century.

Gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color "a few shades from burning". The roux is used with okra or filé powder. Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.

Creole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener. Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.

When Catholics were expected to <a href="Fasting%20and%20abstinence%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">abstain from eating meat</a> during <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from "gumbo aux herbes", or "gumbo of greens"), was often served. This variety combined a large number of <a href="Leaf%20vegetable">greens</a> – typically including <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s, <a href="Brassica%20juncea">mustard greens</a>, and <a href="spinach">spinach</a>. The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid. Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular. It is very rarely served in restaurants. In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.

Gumbo z'herbes may have originated with the French, Germans, or West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish "potage aux herbes" ("soup with greens"), as well as to the African <a href="callaloo">callaloo</a>. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a>. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.

Gumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana. The dish combines the culinary practices of French, Spanish, indigenous tribes, and Africans, as well as Italians, and Germans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived together within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. This fostered an environment in which cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.

The establishment of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a>. French settlers allied with various native tribes including the <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Alabama%20%28people%29">Alabama</a>, and <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.

Slave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719. The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation. The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.

In 1721, 125 Germans settled from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making <a href="sausage">sausage</a>. By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people. Slaves outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.

The colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20Spain%29">Spanish Louisiana</a>. About 2,000 people from the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> moved to the area south of New Orleans. These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought "a love for well-seasoned food", including use of ground <a href="cayenne%20pepper">cayenne pepper</a>, a spicy hot red <a href="chili%20pepper">chili pepper</a>. Spanish authorities also granted permission for a large number of French-speaking <a href="Expulsion%20of%20the%20Acadians">Acadian exiles</a> to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. Louisiana was secretly returned to France <a href="Third%20Treaty%20of%20San%20Ildefonso">in 1800</a>, then <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">purchased</a> by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.

By 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra, and hot pepper plants which likely came from <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>. Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions. Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.

Scholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century, but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food. Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.

As aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American Caribbean and German influence. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.

West Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.

Gumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew <a href="bouillabaisse">bouillabaisse</a>. During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups, using whatever ingredients were readily available. When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage. In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.

Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including <a href="Celestine%20Eustis">Celestine Eustis</a>, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn <a href="grits">grits</a>, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and filé powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.

These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Le%20Moyne%2C%20Sieur%20de%20Bienville">Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville</a>, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine – rice, shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.

The first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, <a href="John%20Sibley%20%28doctor%29">John Sibley</a> described "the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper." The following year, French governor <a href="Pierre%20Clement%20de%20Laussat">Pierre Clement de Laussat</a> hosted a soirée in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events "give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined".

An 1824 cookbook, <a href="Mary%20Randolph">Mary Randolph</a>'s "The Virginia House-Wife", was the first to include a recipe for gumbo. Called "Gumbo – A West India Dish", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for "Ochra Soup" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish <a href="callaloo">callaloo</a>.

A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. Her "Housekeeping in Old Virginia" described "Gumbo Filit A La Creole", a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with <a href="allspice">allspice</a>, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. The 1881 cookbook "<a href="What%20Mrs.%20Fisher%20Knows%20About%20Old%20Southern%20Cooking">What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking</a>", dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. "Oyster Gumbo Soup" used a filé base, while "Ochra Gumbo" and "Chicken Gumbo" used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook "La Cuisine Creole" documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.

Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>. It gained a broader profile after the death of <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> <a href="Allen%20Ellender">Allen Ellender</a>. A native of <a href="Terrebonne%20Parish%2C%20LA">Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana</a>, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef <a href="Paul%20Prudhomme">Paul Prudhomme</a>'s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.

Gumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called "cooked down"), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or <a href="Stock%20%28food%29">stock</a>, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, <a href="bay%20leaf">bay leaves</a>, <a href="thyme">thyme</a>, <a href="hot%20sauce">hot sauce</a>, and salt, are added to taste. According to Nobles, "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.

Creole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice, which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people. Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side. Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a <a href="tureen">tureen</a> on the table. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of <a href="potato%20salad">potato salad</a>. Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.

Soniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.

In "Cajun Foodways", C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as "an economical dish" useful for "feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood". Nobles concurs that "one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd". With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal. The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.

Since the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana. Local <a href="fais%20do-do">fais do-do</a> (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight. Many families "have a gumbo", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.

Gumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.

In rural <a href="Acadiana">Acadiana</a> in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of <a href="Mardi%20Gras">Mardi Gras</a> celebrations. On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as <a href="courir%20de%20Mardi%20Gras">courir de Mardi Gras</a>. Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo. When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when <a href="Lent">Lent</a> begins.

Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana. Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo, and it is a central feature of many local festivals. The self-described "Gumbo Capital of the World", <a href="Bridge%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Bridge City, Louisiana</a>, holds an annual Gumbo Festival. The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3 ft (0.9 m) deep and in diameter. More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2 ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.

Bernard Quatermass

Professor Bernard Quatermass is a fictional scientist, originally created by the writer <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a> for <a href="BBC%20One">BBC Television</a>. An intelligent and highly moral British scientist, Quatermass is a pioneer of the <a href="British%20space%20programme">British space programme</a>, heading the British Experimental Rocket Group. He continually finds himself confronting sinister alien forces that threaten to destroy humanity.

The role of Quatermass was featured in three influential BBC <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction serials</a> of the 1950s, and again in a final serial for <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a> in 1979. A remake of the first serial appeared on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> in 2005. The character also appeared in films, on the radio and in print over a fifty-year period. Kneale picked the character's unusual surname from a <a href="London">London</a> telephone directory, while the first name was in honour of the astronomer <a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a>.

The character of Quatermass has been described by <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a> as Britain's first television hero, and by "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" newspaper as "A brilliantly conceived and finely crafted creation ... [He] remained a modern '<a href="Pilgrim%27s%20Progress%23Characters">Mr Standfast</a>', the one fixed point in an increasingly dreadful and ever-shifting universe." In 2005, an article in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" suggested, "You can see a line running through him and many other British heroes. He shares elements with <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href="Ellen%20MacArthur">Ellen MacArthur</a>."

Little is revealed of Quatermass's early life during the course of the films and television series in which he appears. In "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>", he at one point despairs that he should have stuck to his original career as a <a href="Surveying">surveyor</a>.

In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Memoirs">The Quatermass Memoirs</a>", it is revealed that the Professor was first involved in rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade <a href="prequel">prequel</a> serial "Quatermass in the Third Reich", an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Berlin Olympics</a> and becoming involved with <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> and the German rocket programme, before helping a young <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> refugee to escape from the country. According to "The Quatermass Memoirs", during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Quatermass conducted top secret work for the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20during%20World%20War%20II">British war effort</a>, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.

By 1953 Quatermass is the head of the British Experimental <a href="Rocket">Rocket</a> Group, which has a programme to launch a manned rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in <a href="London">London</a>. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Despite this trauma, Quatermass continues with his space programme, now called the British Rocket Group, and by "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>" (1955) is actively planning the establishment of <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20Moon">Moon bases</a>. In this serial we see his daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, but there is no sign of a wife or other children. In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he never reached his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with "The Quatermass Memoirs"' later assertion of his wife's early death.

At the beginning of the third serial, "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>" (1958–59), Quatermass's funding is being cut back and the Rocket Group is being handed over to military control, much to his disgust. Command is to be handed over to Colonel Breen and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass has helped to save the world and London is recovering from chaos.

It is not clear what happens to the Rocket Group immediately after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen ("<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%20and%20film%29">Quatermass</a>", also released internationally as "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Conclusion">The Quatermass Conclusion</a>" and "<a href="Quatermass%20IV">Quatermass IV</a>", 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a>. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a <a href="dystopia">dystopian</a> world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.

Nigel Kneale conceived the character of Quatermass in 1953, when he was assigned in his capacity as a BBC television staff drama writer to create a new six-part serial to run on Saturday nights in July and August. Kneale initially named his leading character Professor Charlton, but during the writing process decided he wanted something more striking and memorable. 

A native of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, Kneale was inspired by the fact that surnames beginning with "Qu" were common on the island. The eventual name was picked from a London <a href="telephone%20directory">telephone directory</a>; there was a family of that name who traded as <a href="Greengrocer">fruiterers</a> in the city's <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a>. The surname has its origins as a measurement of land assigned in the division of England by the <a href="Normans">Normans</a> following their conquest of the country under <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a> in 1066. The Professor's first name, Bernard, was in honour of the astronomer <a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a>, founder of the <a href="Jodrell%20Bank">Jodrell Bank</a> observatory.

The <a href="television%20director">director</a> assigned to the serial, which was eventually named "The Quatermass Experiment", was <a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a>. A few months beforehand he had directed a play entitled "It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer" for the BBC, and he offered the role of Quatermass to one of the stars of that play, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Morell">André Morell</a>. Morell considered the offer but declined the part, which Cartier then offered to another actor who had appeared in "It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer", <a href="Reginald%20Tate">Reginald Tate</a>, who accepted.

The serial was a success, with the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> later describing it as "one of the most influential series of the 1950s." The following year the BBC's Controller of Programmes, <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a>—who had initially feared that viewers would not accept such an unusual name for the leading character—noted in reference to the impending launch of the rival <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while ["The Quatermass Experiment"] lasted. We are going to need "many" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes."

A sequel, "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>", was accordingly commissioned in 1955, but Reginald Tate died of a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> only a month before production was due to begin. With very little time to find a replacement, <a href="John%20Robinson%20%28English%20actor%29">John Robinson</a> was picked as the only suitable actor available. Robinson was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate and with some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver, and his performance has been criticised as "robotic", although others such as Andrew Pixley in "Time Screen Magazine" praised Robinson for doing compelling work after the initial episode of the serial.

By the summer of 1957, Kneale was working on the scripts for a third and final BBC serial. Titled "Quatermass and the Pit" and again produced and directed by Cartier, this was eventually broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to <a href="Alec%20Clunes">Alec Clunes</a>. Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to André Morell, who this time accepted. Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass. The serial itself has been praised by the <a href="bbc.co.uk">BBC's own website</a> as "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made. It justifies <a href="Television%20licence">licence fees</a> to this day." Despite this success, Kneale was unsure about whether the character would ever return, later telling an interviewer: "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed to me to be quite enough."

Of the TV serials, "Quatermass II" and "Quatermass and the Pit" have been preserved in full. Only the first two episodes of "The Quatermass Experiment" now exist.

At roughly the same time as "Quatermass II" was being transmitted by the BBC, <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> released their film adaptation of the first serial in British cinemas. Directed by <a href="Val%20Guest">Val Guest</a>, it was retitled "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Xperiment">The Quatermass Xperiment</a>" to capitalise on the British "X" classification and starred American actor <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a> as part of a deal to help the film find US distribution. Kneale, who had little involvement with the film, was unimpressed with this casting. "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind." Val Guest has praised Donlevy's performance, saying that "he gave it absolute reality."

Despite Kneale's reservations about the casting, "The Quatermass Xperiment" was the highest-grossing film Hammer had made up to that point in their history, and has since been described by one academic as "the key British science fiction film of the 1950s." Hammer were keen to make an immediate follow-up, and wanted to use Quatermass in their 1956 film "<a href="X%20the%20Unknown">X the Unknown</a>"; however, Kneale refused them the rights, and they created their own substitute character, Doctor Adam Royston. They did release an adaptation of "Quatermass II" in 1957, called "<a href="Quatermass%202">Quatermass 2</a>" and this time with Kneale's involvement in the script. To the writer's displeasure, Donlevy returned as Quatermass.

Hammer also purchased the film rights to <a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit%20%28film%29">"Quatermass and the Pit"</a> (released in the USA as "Five Million Years to Earth"), as it had done with the previous two TV serials, although they did not release <a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit%20%28film%29">their version</a> until 1967. This time the film was directed by <a href="Roy%20Ward%20Baker">Roy Ward Baker</a> and starred Scottish actor <a href="Andrew%20Keir">Andrew Keir</a>, after Morell had been offered and declined the chance to play the part again. Keir's performance was well-received, particularly in contrast to Donlevy's portrayal. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper wrote in 1997 that: "Keir also made many films... most gratifyingly, perhaps, the movie version of "Quatermass and the Pit" (1967), when he finally replaced the absurdly miscast Brian Donlevy."

Soon after the release of the "Quatermass and the Pit" film, Kneale was approached by Hammer about writing a fourth Quatermass story directly for them, but the idea came to nothing.

Possible remakes of one or more of the Hammer film adaptations were also mooted at various points during the 1990s, with <a href="Dan%20O%27Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> scripting a potential new version of "The Quatermass Experiment" in 1993, but again nothing was eventually filmed. In February 2012 <a href="Simon%20Oakes">Simon Oakes</a>, president of the revived <a href="Hammer%20Films">Hammer Films</a>, announced that a new Quatermass film was in active development.

By the early 1970s Kneale was once again regularly writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth "Quatermass" serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>, titled "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%20and%20film%29">Quatermass</a>". This time <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company <a href="Euston%20Films">Euston Films</a> also released a 100-minute film version titled "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Conclusion">The Quatermass Conclusion</a>" or "<a href="Quatermass%20IV">Quatermass IV</a>", for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.

Kneale was not keen to return to the character following this, telling one interviewer, "I blew him up... and I don't feel inclined to invent a 'Son of Quatermass' either." However, in the late 1990s he conceived an idea for a prequel serial, entitled "Quatermass in the Third Reich" set in Germany in the 1930s. The idea was submitted to the BBC, who turned it down.

In 2005, the <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> channel <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> produced a new version of "The Quatermass Experiment", transmitted <a href="live%20television">live</a> as the original had been. <a href="Jason%20Flemyng">Jason Flemyng</a> starred as Quatermass. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"'s television reviewer, Sarah Vine, commented of this production, "Jason Flemyng as Quatermass made a surprisingly good fist of things... the live performance lent the drama an edge that might have been lost in re-takes."

In addition to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen in a variety of other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" to write a new <a href="prose">prose</a> Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt "Quatermass II", which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the "Daily Express" from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.

A script book for "The Quatermass Experiment", including some photographs from the production, was released by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in 1959. This was followed by similar releases of "Quatermass II" and "Quatermass and the Pit", both published in 1960. All three of these releases were reprinted by Arrow Books in 1979 with new introductions by Kneale, to tie-in with the television transmission of the fourth and final serial.

Arrow Books also released a <a href="novelisation">novelisation</a> of the 1979 "Quatermass" serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail not included in the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it was too late for them to be incorporated.

In 1995, <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> producer Paul Quinn approached Kneale with the idea of making a new radio series about Quatermass, and the resulting project was produced and aired as the five-part serial "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Memoirs">The Quatermass Memoirs</a>" on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> in the spring of 1996. The serial had three strands: a <a href="monologue">monologue</a> from Kneale recounting the historical environment in which he created and wrote the original 1950s serials; archive material from the original productions and contemporary news broadcasts; and a dramatised strand set shortly before the 1979 serial, with Quatermass being visited in retreat in Scotland by a reporter eager to write his life story. Of the actors who had previously played Quatermass, only Keir and Mills were still alive; Keir took the role, his final professional performance before his death the following year. "The Quatermass Memoirs" was repeated several times on <a href="digital%20radio">digital radio</a> station <a href="BBC7">BBC7</a> from 2003, and the serial was released on <a href="CD">CD</a> in 2006.

A live <a href="theatre">theatrical</a> production of "Quatermass and the Pit" was staged, with the permission of Kneale, outdoors in a <a href="quarry">quarry</a> at the village of <a href="Cropwell%20Bishop">Cropwell Bishop</a> in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> in August 1997. The adaptation was written by Peter Thornhill and mounted by Creation Productions, with David Longford starring as Quatermass.

All of the various film and surviving television productions featuring Quatermass have been released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>.

Nigel Kneale explained in a 1990s interview the background that had led him to formulate Quatermass and the other characters of the original serial in 1953. "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't want them to be like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not that I wanted to do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour."

Writing in 2005, the television history lecturer Dr Catherine Johnson felt that in the original three 1950s serials, Quatermass as a character represented the championing of science and rationality over the supernatural and the fantastic. "As a leading scientific innovator, Quatermass is invested with scientific and <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a>. Over the three serials, this authority is tested and undermined ... Despite this, the narrative structure of all three serials works to reinforce the authority invested in Quatermass and in science. Although scientific enterprise is responsible for disastrous consequences in the first two "Quatermass" serials, it is only through science that the alien invasions are overcome ... He is invested with the narrative authority to understand and "explain" the fantastic events depicted."

The writer and critic <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> went further, explaining in a 2003 television documentary on Nigel Kneale's career that he believed Quatermass to be not only a representation of science but of humanity itself. Referring to the conclusion of "The Quatermass Experiment", he commented that: "It almost boils down to an editorial speech by Quatermass representing humanity, or the humane aspects of humanity. He talks to the monster, and so the monster is defeated by an intellectual argument or an emotional appeal." Like Kneale, he contrasted this to American science-fiction productions, where the alien adversary would be defeated by "it being blown up or electrocuted, or having the entire firepower of the army turned against it." Hammer had altered their film version of the story so that the creature is in fact killed by being electrocuted.

In contrast to Newman's idea of Quatermass as the embodiment of humanity, writer and lecturer Peter Hutchings in his essay "We are the Martians" sees Quatermass as an isolated character. "In the 1950s Quatermass stories, Quatermass himself is someone who, while working to protect the nation, remains a curiously isolated figure, bereft of anything resembling a meaningful relationship. (In the 1979 "Quatermass", he has acquired a granddaughter; possibly connected with this is the fact that here he seems a much weaker figure who can only defeat the aliens through the sacrifice of the lives of both himself and his granddaughter)." Hutchings also compared this to American productions of the era: "The standard, if not clichéd, figures of the clean-cut square-jawed hero and his girl, which are present in some form or other in most US sf films of this period ... are absent."

The BBC science-fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" has often been heavily influenced by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass have appeared in the programme and its spinoffs. Serials directly influenced include "<a href="The%20Web%20of%20Fear">The Web of Fear</a>", "<a href="The%20Invasion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Invasion</a>", "<a href="Spearhead%20from%20Space">Spearhead from Space</a>", "<a href="The%20Ambassadors%20of%20Death">The Ambassadors of Death</a>", "<a href="Inferno%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Inferno</a>", "<a href="The%20Daemons">The Daemons</a>", "<a href="The%20Seeds%20of%20Doom">The Seeds of Doom</a>" and "<a href="Image%20of%20the%20Fendahl">Image of the Fendahl</a>", as well as the 2007 "<a href="The%20Lazarus%20Experiment">The Lazarus Experiment</a>", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former "Doctor Who" script editor and producer <a href="Derrick%20Sherwin">Derrick Sherwin</a> admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.

In episode three of the 1988 serial "<a href="Remembrance%20of%20the%20Daleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a>", which is set in 1963, military scientific advisor Alison Williams remarks to her colleague Dr Rachel Jensen, "I wish Bernard was here." Rachel replies, "British Rocket Group's got its own problems."

The 1994 "Doctor Who" novel "<a href="Nightshade%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Nightshade</a>" is about an actor who starred in a thinly disguised version of Quatermass, discovering that the events of the serials are becoming reality. The fictional Professor Nightshade was also mentioned in subsequent novels. Author <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> described the "Nightshade" serial in his notes accompanying the e-book release as "a TV series that isn't quite "Quatermass" and isn't quite "Doctor Who"", adding "I was utterly obsessed by Quatermass at that time".

The 1997 "Doctor Who" novel "<a href="The%20Dying%20Days">The Dying Days</a>", set in its year of release, features in one chapter an elderly character introduced halfway through a sentence as "-ermass", and subsequently referred to as "Professor" and "Bernard" during his brief appearance. Author <a href="Lance%20Parkin">Lance Parkin</a> confirmed in his notes accompanying the later <a href="e-book">e-book</a> release that this was a deliberate cameo from Quatermass, specifically the John Mills version from the final serial.

The 2005 "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="The%20Christmas%20Invasion">The Christmas Invasion</a>" featured the British Rocket Group, although the organisation was only identifiable by a logo not clearly seen on screen and never referred to in dialogue. It was, however, heavily referenced in a tie-in website for the episode created by the <a href="bbc.co.uk">bbc.co.uk</a> "Doctor Who" webteam.

In the 2008 "Doctor Who" novel "<a href="Beautiful%20Chaos%20%28Russell%20novel%29">Beautiful Chaos</a>", the Doctor briefly mentions being invited to the Royal Planetary Society by "Bernard and Paula". In the 2009 television episode "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Dead">Planet of the Dead</a>", "Bernard" is used as the name for a unit of measurement, and it is explained that this is in reference to Quatermass—whether as a fictional or a real person is not stated.

<a href="Neil%20Cross">Neil Cross</a>, the writer of the 2013 "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="Hide%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Hide</a>", has stated in interviews that when he was working on his initial ideas for the episode, he took inspiration from the Quatermass serials, and even intended for the character of Bernard Quatermass to appear in the story. However, it was not possible to gain copyright clearance to use the character.

In February 1959 the BBC radio comedy series "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>" broadcast a parody of "Quatermass and the Pit", entitled "The Scarlet Capsule". <a href="Harry%20Secombe">Harry Secombe</a> played his regular character in "The Goon Show", <a href="Neddie%20Seagoon">Neddie Seagoon</a>, in turn playing "Professor Ned Cratermess, <a href="OBE">OBE</a>." This was followed later in the same year by a spoof on another BBC radio comedy show, "That Man Chester", which launched a regular strand entitled "The Quite-a-Mess Three Saga", with <a href="Deryck%20Guyler">Deryck Guyler</a> as "Professor Quite-a-Mess". However, the "Quite-a-Mess" name and references were dropped after only three of the episodes under pressure from Kneale, who felt that a 13-week spoof would be to the detriment of the original character.

In the early 1970s, a British <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> group named both <a href="Quatermass%20%28band%29">themselves</a> and <a href="Quatermass%20%28album%29">their first album</a> "Quatermass".

A television spoof appeared in a 1986 episode of the BBC <a href="sketch%20show">sketch show</a> "<a href="The%20Two%20Ronnies">The Two Ronnies</a>", which featured a sketch entitled "It Came From Outer Hendon", written by <a href="David%20Renwick">David Renwick</a>. This spoof starred <a href="Ronnie%20Corbett">Ronnie Corbett</a> as "Professor Martin Cratermouse".

Nevado del Ruiz

The Nevado del Ruiz (), also known as La Mesa de Herveo () is located on the border of the <a href="Departments%20of%20Colombia">departments</a> of <a href="Caldas%20Department">Caldas</a> and <a href="Tolima%20Department">Tolima</a> in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, about west of the capital city <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>. It is a <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> composed of many layers of <a href="lava">lava</a> alternating with hardened <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a> and other <a href="pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic rock</a>s. Nevado del Ruiz has been active for about two million years, since the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> or <a href="Late%20Pliocene">Late Pliocene</a>, with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period, which began 150 thousand years ago.

The volcano usually generates <a href="Vulcanian%20eruption">Vulcanian</a> to <a href="Plinian%20eruption">Plinian eruption</a>s, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s. These eruptions often cause massive <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment. The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain's snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of <a href="Armero">Armero</a> in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">Armero tragedy</a>—the deadliest lahar in <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a>. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.

The volcano is part of <a href="Los%20Nevados%20National%20Natural%20Park">Los Nevados National Natural Park</a>, which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers. The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars from future eruptions.

Today, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano is constantly monitored by the <a href="Colombian%20Geological%20Survey%23Volcanic_and_Seismic_Observatory_of_Manizales">Volcanic and Seismic Observatory of Manizales</a>.

Nevado del Ruiz, which lies about west of Bogotá, is part of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> mountain range. The volcano is part of the <a href="Cordillera%20Central%20%28Colombia%29">Ruiz–Tolima volcanic massif</a> (or Cordillera Central), a group of five ice-capped volcanoes which includes the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Tolima">Tolima</a>, <a href="Santa%20Isabel%20%28volcano%29">Santa Isabel</a>, <a href="Nevado%20del%20Quind%C3%ADo">Quindio</a> and <a href="Cerro%20Mach%C3%ADn">Machin</a> volcanoes. The massif is located at the intersection of four <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>s, some of which still are active.

Nevado del Ruiz lies within the <a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>, a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the <a href="North%20Volcanic%20Zone">North Volcanic Zone</a> of the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">Andean Volcanic Belt</a>, which contains 75 of the 204 <a href="Holocene%20epoch">Holocene-age</a> volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the oceanic <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> beneath the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American continental plate</a>. As is the case for many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive <a href="Plinian%20eruption">Plinian eruption</a>s with associated <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (mud and debris flows).

Like many other Andean volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz is a <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a>: a voluminous, roughly conical volcano consisting of many <a href="Stratum">strata</a> of hardened lava and <a href="tephra">tephra</a> including <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a>. Its lavas are <a href="andesite">andesitic</a>–<a href="dacite">dacitic</a> in composition. The modern <a href="volcanic%20cone">volcanic cone</a> comprises five <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s, all constructed within the <a href="caldera">caldera</a> of an ancestral Ruiz volcano: <a href="Nevado%20El%20Cisne">Nevado El Cisne</a>, Alto de la Laguna, La Olleta, Alto la Pirana, and Alto de Santano. It covers an area of more than , stretching from east to west. The mountain's broad summit includes the Arenas crater, which is in diameter and deep. Nevado del Ruiz, as its neighbours to the southwest Nevado El Cisne and <a href="Nevado%20de%20Santa%20Isabel">Nevado de Santa Isabel</a> is located over the Palestina Fault that crosscuts the underlying <a href="El%20Bosque%20Batholith">El Bosque Batholith</a>, dated at 49.1 ± 1.7 Ma.

The summit of the volcano has steep slopes <a href="inclination">inclining</a> from 20 to 30 degrees. At lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their inclination is about 10 degrees. From there on, <a href="foothills">foothills</a> stretch almost to the edge of the <a href="Magdalena%20River">Magdalena River</a>, north of the volcano and the <a href="Cauca%20River">Cauca River</a> to the west. On the two major sides of the summit, <a href="headwall">headwall</a>s show where past <a href="rock%20avalanche">rock avalanche</a>s occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent's deadliest eruption in 1985. On the volcano's southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times.

The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s ("nevado" means "snow-covered" in Spanish), which formed over many thousands of years, and have generally retreated since the <a href="last%20glacial%20maximum">last glacial maximum</a>. From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about of the Ruiz–Tolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered . During the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>, which lasted from about 1600 to 1900 CE, the ice cap covered approximately .

Since then the <a href="Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850">glaciers have retreated</a> further because of atmospheric warming. By 1959, the massif's glaciated area had dropped to . Since the 1985 eruption, which destroyed about 10% of the summit ice cover, the area of Nevado del Ruiz covered by glaciers has halved—from just after the eruption to about in 2003. The glaciers reached altitudes as low as in 1985 but have now retreated to elevations of .

The ice cap is approximately thick on average. It is thickest in parts of the summit plateau and under the Nereides Glacier on the southwestern slopes, where it is as deep as . Glaciers on the northern and, to a lesser extent, the eastern slopes lost the most ice in the 1985 eruption, and therefore reach only up to deep. The deep ice covering the summit plateau may hide a caldera. Five domes ringing the summit plateau have emerged as the ice has retreated.

The <a href="meltwater">meltwater</a> from the glaciers drains primarily to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively. <a href="Surface%20runoff">Runoff</a> from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes is a source of fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' <a href="water%20supply">water supply</a> should the glaciers melt completely.

Nevado del Ruiz is generally poorly forested because of its high elevation, and its forest cover decreases with increasing elevation. At lower elevations, well-developed <a href="mesic%20forest">mesic forest</a>s (20–35 meters / 66–110 ft high) are present. Above these but below the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a>, parts of the volcano are covered with dwarf forests high. Above the tree line, in the <a href="P%C3%A1ramo">Páramo</a> zone, the vegetation is dominated by plants such as bunchgrass and <a href="Espeletia">Espeletia</a>. Regional vegetation consists of different families of woody plants, including <a href="Rubiaceae">Rubiaceae</a>, <a href="Leguminosae">Leguminosae</a>, <a href="Melastomataceae">Melastomataceae</a>, <a href="Lauraceae">Lauraceae</a>, and <a href="Moraceae">Moraceae</a>. Flowers such as "<a href="Polypodiaceae">Polypodiaceae</a> s.l.", <a href="Araceae">Araceae</a>, <a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a>, <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>, <a href="Piperaceae">Piperaceae</a>, and <a href="Orchidaceae">Orchidaceae</a> are also present in the region.

Animals living on the volcano include the <a href="Tapirus%20pinchaque">mountain tapir</a> and <a href="spectacled%20bear">spectacled bear</a>, both of which are designated as <a href="Threatened%20species">threatened</a>. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the <a href="Bolborhynchus%20ferrugineifrons">rufous-fronted parakeet</a>, <a href="bearded%20helmetcrest">bearded helmetcrest</a>, and <a href="Herveo%20plump%20toad">Herveo plump toad</a>. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.

Nevado del Ruiz is one of several stratovolcanoes within <a href="Los%20Nevados%20National%20Natural%20Park">Los Nevados National Natural Park</a>, a national park located west of Bogotá in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby <a href="Lake%20Ot%C3%BAn">Lake Otún</a> offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.
In 1868–1869, German geologists <a href="Wilhelm%20Reiss">Wilhelm Reiss</a> and <a href="Alphons%20St%C3%BCbel">Alphons Stübel</a> were the first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and <a href="Augusto%20Gansser-Biaggi">Augusto Gansser-Biaggi</a> made the first successful ascent, partly by ski; they repeated the ascent in 1939.

The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 <a href="myr">million years ago</a> at the beginning of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: "ancestral", "older" and "present". During the "ancestral" period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the "older" period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.

The "present" period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple <a href="Landslide">slope failures</a> (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, <a href="volcanologist">volcanologist</a>s have used <a href="tephrochronology">tephrochronology</a> to date them.

During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a>), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a <a href="phreatic%20explosion">phreatic (steam) explosion</a>. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after <a href="Galeras">Galeras</a>.

On the morning of March 12, 1595, Nevado del Ruiz erupted. The episode consisted of three Plinian eruptions, which were heard up to from the summit of the volcano. A large amount of ash was ejected, which completely darkened the surrounding area. The volcano also erupted <a href="lapilli">lapilli</a> (a form of tephra) and <a href="volcanic%20bomb">pumice bombs</a>. In total, the eruption produced 0.16 km of tephra. The eruption was preceded by a large precursor earthquake three days before. The eruption caused lahars, which traveled down the valleys of the nearby Gualí and Lagunillas rivers, clogging up the water, killing fish and destroying vegetation. More than 600 people died as a result of the lahar. The 1595 eruption was the last major eruption of Nevado del Ruiz before 1985. The 1595 and 1985 eruptions were similar in many respects, including in the chemical composition of the erupted material.

On the morning of February 19, 1845, a large earthquake resulted in a substantial <a href="mudflow">mudflow</a>. This mudflow flowed down the valley of the Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the <a href="channel%20%28geography%29">river channel</a> and killing much of the local population. After reaching an <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a>, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90 degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000 people were killed in the mudflows.

Beginning November 1984, geologists observed an increasing level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other signs of a forthcoming eruption included increased <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a> activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and small <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>s. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.

An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, indicating a direct release of <a href="magma">magma</a> into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.

In November 1985, volcanic activity once again increased as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched in <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, which were leached from the magma. The <a href="thermodynamic">thermodynamic</a> equilibration (stationary heat energy) temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, were from to . The extensive <a href="degassing">degassing</a> of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.

At 3:06 pm, on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz began to erupt, ejecting dacitic tephra more than into the atmosphere. The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s—only 3% of the amount that erupted from <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> in 1980. The eruption reached a value of 3 on the <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a>. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 tonnes, or about 2% of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich.

The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks. It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>s and <a href="chloride">chloride</a>s found in the lahar flow.

The lahars, formed of water, ice, <a href="pumice">pumice</a>, and other rocks, mixed with clay as they travelled down the volcano's flanks. They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of 60 km per hour, eroding soil, dislodging rock, and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars were directed into all of the six river valleys leading from the volcano. While in the river valleys, the lahars grew to almost 4 times their original volume. In the Gualí River, a lahar reached a maximum width of .

One of the lahars virtually erased the town of Armero in <a href="Tolima%20Department">Tolima</a>, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of <a href="Chinchin%C3%A1%2C%20Caldas">Chinchiná</a>, in the department of <a href="Caldas%20Department">Caldas</a>. In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed. The <a href="Armero%20tragedy">Armero tragedy</a>, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Pel%C3%A9e">Mount Pelée</a>, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is also the deadliest known lahar, and Colombia's worst natural disaster. A young girl named <a href="Omayra%20S%C3%A1nchez">Omayra Sánchez</a> became a worldwide symbol of the disaster after images of her trapped under the debris of her former home, after the eruption made the news worldwide.

The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger. Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred more than 140 years earlier, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the "Sleeping Lion". <a href="Hazard%20map">Hazard map</a>s showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a> agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening. Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.

Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several <a href="long-period%20earthquakes">long-period earthquakes</a>, which start out strong and then slowly die out, had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, "the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read this signal.

The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. The most likely hazard is small-volume eruptions, which might destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano's glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to —similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. Such lahars can travel up to along river valleys in a matter of few hours. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are in danger, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. Lahars poses a threat to nearby towns of <a href="Honda%2C%20Tolima">Honda</a>, <a href="Mariquita%2C%20Tolima">Mariquita</a>, <a href="Ambalema">Ambalema</a>, Chinchiná, <a href="Herveo">Herveo</a>, <a href="Villahermosa%2C%20Tolima">Villa Hermosa</a>, <a href="Salgar">Salgar</a> and <a href="La%20Dorada%2C%20Caldas">La Dorada</a>. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored.
A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of <a href="El%20Dorado%20International%20Airport">Bogotá's airport</a> due to ashfall.

As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program ("Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres", 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning in order to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. When another Colombian volcano, the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Huila">Nevado del Huila</a>, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another "Nevado del Ruiz".

In 2006, heavy rains on Ruiz sent a mudslide down the Chinchiná River, killing nine youths aged 12–19 on a scouting expedition near the volcano.

During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual increases in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical analysis of the volcano demonstrated <a href="Deformation%20%28engineering%29">deformative</a> changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-<a href="Tornillo%20event">Tornillo event</a>s, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, <a href="Tiltmeter">tilt</a> increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight times as many as had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of increases in sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.

Scientists flying over the volcano on March 8, 2012 noted fresh ash deposits on the east flank of the volcano near the crater, likely from an phreatic eruption on February 22. Later that day, a small ash plume erupted from the crater; by March 13, scientists detected ash deposits at the head of the Gualí River. After seismicity continued to increase, the alert level was raised to Orange, and in April Nevados National Natural Park authority closed the reserve, fearing lahars and ashfall hazards. The sudden activity peak in March did not culminate in a major eruption, and activity declined enough that the alert level was lowered to Yellow on May 3. On May 29, seismicity rapidly increased, and the alert level was restored to Orange because ash fell into more than 20 nearby communities. Over the next few months ash fell frequently until earthquakes increased again in June. Because of the severity of these tremors, evacuations were ordered by the Emergency Committee of Caldas on news media for 300–1500 people near the volcano. The alert level was raised to Red, indicating an imminent major volcanic event, and an eruption in diameter took place on July 2, 2012, continuing intermittently until the end of August. Ash plumes and sulfur dioxide emissions recurred until January 2013.

Through the beginning of July 2013, ashfall took place at Nevado del Ruiz a few times per month. On July 11, 2013, there was a relatively large explosion, followed by inactivity until August, when emission of ash resumed, continuing intermittently until April 2014. Reports of ashfall stopped until October 2014. In November 2014, earthquakes were recorded, and volcanic ash was observed near the summit; ashfall reached local communities within a radius of Nevado del Ruiz multiple times each month until December 2015. A lava dome was extruded from August to the end of October in 2015, coinciding with thermal anomalies increasing near the summit crater at the end of the same year. According to the Global Volcanism Program, the last documented eruption at Nevado del Ruiz took place in 2017. However, reports from the Servicio Geológico Colombiano observatory at Manizales through the end of October 2018 suggested earthquakes near the volcano, with phreatic eruptions ejecting water vapor, volcanic ash, and volcanic gases up to over its crater.

Thomas C. Hindman

Thomas C. Hindman (born Thomas Carmichael Hindman, Jr.; January 28, 1828 – September 27, 1868) was a <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a>, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States Representative</a> from the <a href="Arkansas%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">1st Congressional District</a> of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and <a href="Major%20general">Major-General</a> in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Shortly after he was born in <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, Hindman moved with his family to <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Alabama">Jacksonville, Alabama</a>, and later <a href="Ripley%2C%20Mississippi">Ripley, Mississippi</a>. After receiving his primary education in Ripley, he attended the <a href="Lawrenceville%20School">Lawrenceville Classical Institute</a> (now known as the Lawrenceville School) and graduated with honors. Afterwards, he raised a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> in <a href="Tippah%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Tippah County</a> for the 2nd <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> regiment in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. Hindman served during the war as a <a href="First%20lieutenant%23United%20States">lieutenant</a> and later as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> of his company. After the war, he returned to Ripley. He <a href="reading%20law">studied law</a>, and was admitted to the state bar in 1851. He started a law practice in Ripley, and served as a member of the <a href="Mississippi%20House%20of%20Representatives">Mississippi House of Representatives</a> from 1854 to 1856.

Hindman moved his law practice to <a href="Helena%2C%20Arkansas">Helena, Arkansas</a> after his term in the Mississippi House ended. He was elected as the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> Representative from Arkansas's 1st congressional district in the <a href="36th%20United%20States%20Congress">Thirty-sixth Congress</a> from March 4, 1859 to March 4, 1861. He was re-elected to the <a href="37th%20United%20States%20Congress">Thirty-seventh Congress</a>, but declined to serve after the onset of the Civil War and Arkansas' <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">secession</a> from the Union. Instead, Hindman joined the armed forces of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. He was promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">brigadier general</a> on September 28, 1861, and to major general on April 18, 1862. He commanded the <a href="Trans-Mississippi%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Trans-Mississippi Department</a>, and later raised and commanded "Hindman's Legion" for the Confederate States Army. After the war, Hindman avoided surrender to the federal government by fleeing to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. He worked in Mexico as a coffee planter and attempted to practice law. After the execution of <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian I of Mexico</a> in 1867, Hindman submitted a petition for a pardon to President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, but it was denied. Hindman, nonetheless, returned to his former life in Helena. He became the leader of the "Young Democracy", a new political organization that was willing to accept the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> for the restoration of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>. He was assassinated on September 27, 1868 at his Helena home.

Hindman's parents, Thomas Hindman and Sallie Holt Hindman, were of English and Scottish ancestry. His maternal ancestors included Major Robert Holt, a successful planter and a member of the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a> <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> in 1655. The Holt family originally came from <a href="Halifax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Halifax County, Virginia</a> before moving to Knoxville. Hindman's paternal lineage descended from the Carmichael clan in Scotland, some members of which made their way into America after <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II of Great Britain</a> ousted nine hundred Scottish followers of <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Bonnie Prince Charles</a> to America after the April 16, 1746 <a href="Battle%20of%20Culloden">Battle of Culloden</a>.

One of the descendants of the Carmichael clan, Sarah Carmichael, married Samuel Hindman, a wealthy <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> merchant in the early 1790s. They then moved to Knoxville, and their youngest son Thomas C. Hindman, Sr. was born on November 10, 1793. Family legend claims that Hindman, Sr. was the first white male child born in Knoxville.

Hindman, Sr. was an <a href="ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> in the <a href="39th%20United%20States%20Infantry">39th United States Infantry</a> during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. He was promoted to third lieutenant on January 11, 1814, and to second lieutenant on May 20 of the same year. He fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>, the final major battle of the war, and served on active duty until he resigned on June 30, 1816 due to health concerns. After leaving the army, Hindman, Sr. operated a military ferry on the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> and served as a lieutenant colonel in the 10th Territorial Militia Regiment for the <a href="Alabama%20Territory">Alabama Territory</a>. In his dealings as a merchant, he met Lewis Ross. Hindman, Sr. was a frequent visitor at the Ross household, and it was there that he met Lewis' sister-in-law, Sallie Holt. After a brief courtship, the couple was married in Knoxville on January 21, 1819. After settling down in <a href="Rhea%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Rhea County, Tennessee</a>, their first daughter was born in 1820. Three more children, Robert, Mary, and Sarah, were born after the family moved to Post Oak Springs. The family moved back to Knoxville in 1827. Thomas Carmichael Hindman, Jr. was born the next year, and Mildred followed in the year after that.

The elder Hindman frequently made business trips to <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and even moved the family to Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He took advantage of the many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee Indian</a> tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by the <a href="Cherokee%20Nation">Cherokee Nation</a> and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of <a href="Indian%20agent">United States Agent</a> for the Cherokee Nation. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Albert%20Miller%20Lea">Albert M. Lea</a> to determine why the Cherokees in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> had rejected the government's suggestion to <a href="Indian%20removal">join other parts of the tribe</a> in <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.

That year, Hindman's father purchased a new plantation in Ripley, Mississippi. Meanwhile, the younger Hindman attended local schools before leaving for the <a href="Lawrenceville%20Classical%20Institute">Lawrenceville Classical Institute</a> in <a href="Lawrenceville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lawrenceville, New Jersey</a>, the third oldest boarding school in the country. Hindman received a classical education there and graduated with honors on September 25, 1843, as the class <a href="salutatorian">salutatorian</a>. After spending some time visiting relatives and studying in New York, Hindman went back to Ripley and commenced his <a href="reading%20law">law studies</a> under Orlando Davis, a notable local attorney and <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> politician.

Meanwhile, Hindman's father became an active participant in Mississippi politics. He led the state's Whig Party and served as a member of the executive committee of the local <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> club. In 1845, he was selected as a delegate to attend a convention in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a> that promoted transportation and infrastructural projects in the South and West.

Soon, the United States Army engaged in fighting at the US-Mexico border. After skirmishes along the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> between Mexican forces and American forces led by <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, Congress approved a <a href="United%20States%20declaration%20of%20war%20upon%20Mexico">declaration of war</a> and President <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> called upon the states to draw up 50,000 volunteers to be alongside the army. Mississippi newspapers encouraged state residents to join the action. One newspaper, the <a href="Holly%20Springs%2C%20Mississippi">Holly Springs</a> "Guard", proclaimed, "To arms! To arms! Ye brave! Th' avenging sword unsheathe: March on, march on, all hearts resolved, on [to] victory or death."

Hindman was eager to have the chance of serving his country in war. He enlisted as a <a href="Second%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">Second Lieutenant</a> in <a href="company%20%28military%29">company</a> E of the Second Mississippi Infantry. His older brother, Robert, also joined the same unit as a private. Hindman and his fellow infantrymen spent the winter training for battle in Camp McClung. Many soldiers were unprepared for the cold temperatures in January 1847 and, as a result, many died of <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and "the cold plague". The Second Mississippi Infantry headed off towards the <a href="United%20States%E2%80%93Mexico%20border">United States–Mexico border</a> in February and reached the mouth of the Rio Grande on February 24, 1847, just a day after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buena%20Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. They continued marching, and the number of deaths escalated. By June 1847, 167 men had died, 134 had been discharged, and 38 had deserted. The infantry later moved to Buena Vista, seven miles (11 km) south of <a href="Saltillo%2C%20Coahuila">Saltillo, Coahuila</a>, for guard duty. The anticipation of glory for the regiment evaporated amongst the ravages of disease, guerrilla raids, and camp duties. In March 1847, Colonel Charles Clark assigned Hindman the position of appointment as the acting regiment's adjutant, due to his educational background and writing skills. Hindman's brother, Robert, who was now a sergeant, suffered from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and was medically discharged on April 23. Hindman rose to the rank of Lieutenant and Post Adjutant by the end of the war in 1848, but did not see any major action during the remainder of his time with the Infantry.

After returning to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A year after the war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged in a fight with William Falkner because he thought that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the <a href="Sons%20of%20Temperance">Sons of Temperance</a>. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee "Appeal".

Hindman himself joined the Ripley chapter of the Sons of Temperance and served as the recording secretary of the local branch. In 1853, he successfully campaigned for a seat to represent Tippah County in the Mississippi legislature. Hindman's Mississippi lawmaking career ended when the legislature adjourned in March 1854.

By 1854, Hindman realized that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.

Hindman threw himself into the political and social scenes in his new home state. In June 1854, he formed a law partnership with John Palmer, a young Kentucky native who was known as a "distinguished member" of the Helena bar. Hindman became active in civic affairs and plans for Helena's economic development. At an Independence Day festival in 1854, he gave a speech about the importance of railroad development in Arkansas. Hindman catapulted himself into the fray by taking a stand against the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic <a href="Know-Nothing%20movement">Know-Nothings</a>, whom he considered "pestilent fanatics". Hindman and Palmer established a <a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic</a> association designed to stamp out the Know-Nothing threat. During this time, Hindman became close friends with <a href="Patrick%20Cleburne">Patrick Cleburne</a>, who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the "Democratic Star," in December 1855.

Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with Know-Nothing members. After the men had recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to any charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. Hindman received praise for his actions and became a force in Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated.

In 1856, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201856">Hindman ran</a> for the Congressional seat in his First District, but was defeated by the incumbent, <a href="Alfred%20B.%20Greenwood">Alfred B. Greenwood</a>, at the Democratic state convention. His gracious withdrawal at the convention to avoid Democratic infighting earned him more notice from the party hierarchy. During this time, Hindman met and courted Mary "Mollie" Watkins Biscoe. Despite her parents' reluctance, the two were married on November 11, 1856, with Patrick Cleburne serving as best man.

In the summer of 1857, Hindman became editor of the "Helena States-Rights Democrat" and was the unchallenged leader of the Democratic Party in eastern Arkansas. From this platform, he launched his 1858 Congressional bid. He did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, and had the backing of newspapers throughout the state. Editor Richard H. Johnson of the <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> "True Democrat" reminded voters of Hindman's previous run for the nomination in 1856 and praised him for being a "thorough[-]going Democrat" of "marked abilities". At the state Democratic convention in <a href="Batesville%2C%20Arkansas">Batesville</a>, Hindman easily defeated A. M. Wilson and Dandridge McRae. In the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201858%20and%201859">general election</a>, Hindman defeated the Republican challenger, William M. Crosby, by a vote of 18,255 to 2,853.

During his term, Hindman tried to bring unity to the state's Democratic Party. He turned on the political hierarchy in the state, and political warfare divided the Democratic Party in Arkansas, with the pro-Hindman forces on one side and the forces of the <a href="The%20Family%20%28Arkansas%20politics%29">political "family"</a> that had ruled Arkansas since territorial days on the other. He labeled the actions of the "family" as "the most concentrated wrath of the small managers of the caucus and of certain outside high-priests who manage[d] them".

"Family" leaders threatened to block Hindman's <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201860">1860 re-election</a> to Congress. Hindman challenged them and predicted the overthrow of a group he called "the fusionists" and "champions of amalgamation". The dispute between Hindman and the political family escalated after Hindman charged that the state had been overpaying the "True Democrat" for public printing. The "True Democrat" denied the allegations and claimed that Hindman's motive was out of selfishness, rather than concern. They argued that he wanted printing contracts to be awarded to the Helena "State-Rights Democrat" and the Little Rock "Old Line Democrat", both of which he controlled.

One of the "family" leaders, <a href="Elias%20Nelson%20Conway">Elias Nelson Conway</a>, sought to settle the state's banking situation by starting a plan that would seize the assets of people indebted to the bank, who included Hindman's father-in-law. Hindman travelled across the state to publicly denounce the proposition. In the <a href="Arkansas%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201860">1860 race</a> for governor, Hindman backed <a href="Henry%20Massey%20Rector">Henry Massey Rector</a>, while the "family" candidate was Richard H. Johnson, the editor of the "True Democrat". Johnson had been nominated as the Democratic candidate, but Rector announced his candidacy as an independent Democrat. In the gubernatorial election, Rector narrowly defeated Johnson by a vote of 31,044 to 28,967. After the election, the editor of the "Old-Line Democrat", Thomas C. Peek, proclaimed that the end of the political dynasty of the "family" had come. New issues such as the Civil War were brought to center stage and the "family" never exercised their dominance over state politics again.

As the Civil War approached, Hindman was a passionate voice for secession and was primarily Arkansas's most prominent <a href="Fire-Eaters">Fire-Eater</a>. When Arkansas voted 65–5 to secede from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> in May 1861, Hindman was present in the gallery of the convention. With war approaching, Hindman resigned from Congress and recruited a regiment at Helena, which was mustered into Confederate service. He made a request to the state government for muskets, clothing and ten days of rations so that his men could "fight for our country". By June 1, Hindman had raised ten companies which would eventually become known as the <a href="2nd%20Arkansas%20Infantry">2nd Arkansas Infantry</a>, with six companies stationed at Helena and four at <a href="Pine%20Bluff%2C%20Arkansas">Pine Bluff</a>. He lost five companies who refused to leave the state to fight. Afterwards, Hindman followed orders to report to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. He began the long journey with his regiment in June. By September, Hindman was promoted to the rank of <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">brigadier general</a>. He and his regiment were shipped to Kentucky and reported to superiors <a href="William%20Hardee">William Hardee</a> and <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20Central%20Kentucky">Army of Central Kentucky</a>.

After the fall of <a href="Fort%20Henry%2C%20Tennessee">Fort Henry</a> and <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> in February 1862, Johnston abandoned Kentucky and Tennessee to consolidate his forces at <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>. Fierce fighting at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> in April, soon followed. During the battle, Johnston and Hindman were wounded, Johnston mortally. Command of the <a href="Army%20of%20Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a> fell upon General <a href="P.G.T.%20Beauregard">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, who wrote the following in his report: "Brigadier General Hindman, engaged in the outset of the battle, was conspicuous for a cool courage efficiently employed in leading his men ever into the thickest of the fray, until his horse was shot under him, and he was unfortunately so severely injured by the fall that the army was deprived, on the following day, of his chivalrous example."

After his recovery, Hindman was promoted to the rank of major-general and commanded the Second Corps of <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Corinth">Siege of Corinth</a> before being appointed commander of the desolate Trans-Mississippi Department to prevent an invasion into eastern Arkansas by <a href="Samuel%20Ryan%20Curtis">Samuel Curtis</a>. <a href="Arkansas%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Events in Arkansas</a> had taken a terrible turn for the worse. Most units had been stripped from the state for service east of the Mississippi River. When Hindman arrived in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, he found that his command was "bare of soldiers, penniless, defenseless, and dreadfully exposed" to the Federal Army that was approaching dangerously from the northeast.

Hindman set to work and issued a series of harsh military edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies for the defense of the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted <a href="Texas">Texas</a> troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.

Hindman's edicts, however, raised the ire of the local citizenry, and his political enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent <a href="Theophilus%20H.%20Holmes">Theophilus H. Holmes</a>. Hindman convinced Holmes to give him a field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at <a href="Prairie%20Grove%2C%20Arkansas">Prairie Grove, Arkansas</a>, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him. Hindman's position was well selected, but the better equipped and supplied Federal forces wore down the Confederate forces and Hindman was forced to withdraw back towards Little Rock, having missed his chance to destroy the Federal army. After the stalemate at Prairie Grove, Hindman was transferred back across the river and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> alongside his friend Pat Cleburne.

After being wounded in the neck at Chickamauga, Hindman and his Legion continued to fight along with the <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> against General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> in the <a href="Atlanta%20Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, seeing action across northwestern Georgia from the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Dalton">First Battle of Dalton</a>, to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca">Battle of Resaca</a>; the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Hope%20Church">Battle of New Hope Church</a>; the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kolb%27s%20Farm">Battle of Kolb's Farm</a>; the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kennesaw%20Mountain">Battle of Kennesaw Mountain</a>, just outside <a href="Marietta%2C%20Georgia">Marietta, Georgia</a>. On July 4, 1864 at Kennesaw Mountain, he was struck in the eye by a tree limb and fell off his horse. Hindman suffered severe injuries that left him unfit for service on the battlefield. He went to Atlanta and later <a href="Macon%2C%20Georgia">Macon</a> to recuperate from his injuries. Afterward, Hindman hoped that he would be able to fight after a full recovery. He applied for a transfer to the Trans-Mississippi Department. His request was denied by the Confederate War Department, but Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> offered Hindman a leave of absence until he had fully recovered from his "physical disability".

After his leave of absence had been approved in August, Hindman set out for Texas. During their journey, Hindman's second daughter, Sallie, died of an illness near <a href="Meridian%2C%20Mississippi">Meridian, Mississippi</a>. Hindman arrived in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> and settled there with his family for the time being. He was honored by military officials and residents on January 26, 1865. By May 1865, Confederate generals in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> signed a document with Union generals detailing the <a href="Conclusion%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Confederate terms of surrender</a>. Hindman refused to surrender and, along with many other ex-Confederates, he crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico and sought asylum.

Hindman joined Confederate refugees in the Mexican town of <a href="New%20Virginia%20Colony">Carlota</a>, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application was one of the few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%23Suffrage">ineligible to run for office</a>, he came out against the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a <a href="treason">treason</a> indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.

At around 9:30 on the night of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his newspaper with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with <a href="Powell%20Clayton">Powell Clayton</a> as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the "Gazette" said Hindman died as an "able and distinguished man" whose "short but splendid career" had a profound impact on Arkansan state politics.

Hindman's assassins were never caught, and many theories regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the <a href="Phillips%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Phillips County</a> jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly confessed to the crime, saying the murder was part of a larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named <a href="Maple%20Hill%20Cemetery%20%28Helena-West%20Helena%2C%20Arkansas%29">Maple Hill Cemetery</a>) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.

<a href="Arkansas%20Post">Arkansas Post</a> was named Fort Hindman for him during the American Civil War.

Vagrant Story

The game takes place in the <a href="fictional%20country">fictional kingdom</a> of Valendia and the <a href="ghost%20town">ruined city</a> of Leá Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a <a href="cult">cult</a> leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the <a href="prologue">prologue</a>, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.

"Vagrant Story" is unique as a console action-adventure role-playing game in that it features no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game received critical acclaim from gaming magazines and websites.

"Vagrant Story" is a solo <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a>, in which the player controls Ashley Riot from a <a href="isometric%20projection">third-person perspective</a> while exploring Leá Monde and the <a href="catacombs">catacombs</a> underneath. The player may also switch into <a href="first-person%20perspective">first-person perspective</a> to allow for a 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the <a href="Dual%20Analog">game controller</a>. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system%23Cartesian%20coordinates%20in%20three%20dimensions">three-dimensional</a> field map. Navigation is in <a href="real-time%20computing">real-time</a>, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.

Ashley can run, jump, and push crates and cubes to navigate around obstacles, adding <a href="Computer%20puzzle%20game">puzzle</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements to gameplay. During the game, the player must sometimes solve block puzzles to advance the story. When the player returns to a completed block puzzle room, a time-attack mode called "Evolve, or Die!!" begins. Players must reach the end of the room in the shortest time possible, after which they are ranked. This stage is optional and can be turned off from the menu.

In the field map, players may engage the enemy as soon as they enter Battle Mode, which uses a <a href="Time-keeping%20systems%20in%20games%23Pausable%20real-time">pausable real-time</a> combat system, much like Square's "<a href="Parasite%20Eve%20%28video%20game%29">Parasite Eve</a>" (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a <a href="Music%20video%20game">rhythm game</a>. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his <a href="hit%20points">hit points</a> (HP) for increased damage.

Magic in "Vagrant Story" is learned later in the game using <a href="Grimoire">Grimoire</a>s that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell associated with the Grimoire will remain in the menu, and players only need to spend <a href="magic%20point">magic point</a>s (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create <a href="status%20effect">status effect</a>s, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.

Risk is an essential element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score <a href="critical%20hit">critical hit</a>s and restore higher HP.

"Vagrant Story"s crafting system allows the player to create and customize weapons and armor in designated "workshop" areas, inputting various ranges, strengths, and statistics. Weapons fall into one of three main damage types: blunt, piercing, and edged. Equipment are influenced by their material and affinity to enemy classes and elements. Affinities influence the effectiveness of weapons and armor; however, equipment might lose one form of affinity when it gains another type. Weapons and armor can be combined, merging their affinities and sometimes creating a new type of blade or armor in the process. Different weapon types have different ranges, such as a <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a> having a longer range than melee weapons such as a <a href="mace%20%28bludgeon%29">mace</a>.

Like several Square titles, the <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a> option is made available to the player upon first completing the game. In "Vagrant Story", selecting "New Game+" enables the player to replay the story using their end-game weapons, items, and statistics instead of the defaults. This option allows players to access a hidden level, which features more intimidating enemies and more powerful equipment. The story does not change, and original enemy statistics will remain at default.

"Vagrant Story" is set in the fictitious city of Leá Monde, while the kingdom of Valendia is engulfed in <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a>. Leá Monde is an old town with a history spanning more than two millennia. Located on an island surrounded by <a href="reef">reef</a>s, the walls have been the "witness of many battles" and are "stronger than the mightiest forts of Valendia". In its golden years, Leá Monde was a thriving community until an earthquake struck the town 25 years before the game, destroying the city and leaving the ground unstable.

The Grand Cathedral and the Temple of Kiltia are at the center of the city. This area is surrounded by the west and east districts, both in fairly good shape, as well as the massive, fortress-like City Walls. Beneath the ground are an abandoned <a href="shaft%20mining">mineshaft</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="quarry">quarry</a>, the shadowy <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a>s of an "Undercity", and the dark Iron Maiden dungeon. The maze-like Snowfly Forest, named for the so-called snowflies that can be found within, covers part of the city. Other locations include the Graylands, the setting for the prologue event; and Valnain, the city where the Valendia Knights of Peace's Headquarters is located. While Valendia and Leá Monde are fictitious, the game's scenery is inspired by real-life landscapes of the southwest of <a href="France">France</a>, including the city of <a href="Saint-%C3%89milion">Saint-Émilion</a>.

The <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> is Ashley Riot, a male member of the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP) in pursuit of a <a href="cult">cult</a> leader named Sydney Losstarot. Sydney, leader of the religious cult Müllenkamp, laid siege to Duke Bardorba's <a href="Manor%20house">manor</a> in search of a key and kidnapped Bardorba's son, Joshua. Ashley's partner is Callo Merlose, an agent of the VKP Inquisitors. Also attempting to capture Sydney is Romeo Guildenstern of the Crimson Blades, whose mission was undertaken without the approval of the VKP.

Ashley is a Riskbreaker, a militant division of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.

The Crimson Blades, under direct orders of Cardinal Batistum, are a group that is part of the Cardinal's Knights of the Cross, in charge of seeking <a href="Heresy">heretics</a> and quelling cults. Romeo Guildenstern, their leader, is a pious man, deeply faithful to his belief and consequently immune to the Dark's powers. Under orders of the Cardinal, he pursues Sydney with a small army in his command and his captains: Samantha, Duane, Grissom, Tieger and Neesa.

Müllenkamp is a cult based in Leá Monde. The city suffered a catastrophe when the population was killed in an earthquake. The city, filled with corpses controlled by Darkness, is the cult's stronghold. Sydney and his accomplice, Hardin, survive the pursuit of the Crimson Blade, though Hardin sometimes doubts Sydney's intentions.

The plot of "Vagrant Story", titled "The Phantom Pain", is presented as the prelude to the "story of the wanderer". Beginning in the Graylands, Ashley and Callo are sent by the VKP to Duke Bardorba's manor to investigate the Duke's involvement with Müllenkamp and the Cardinal's interest in Sydney Losstarot. Ashley infiltrates the manor and encounters Sydney, witnessing his powers first hand. Sydney escapes with his accomplice Hardin and the Duke's son Joshua, leaving Ashley with a clue to his whereabouts. This event was dubbed the "Graylands Incident".
Ashley and Callo arrive in Leá Monde and a lone Ashley infiltrates the city through the underground wine cellars. Along the way, he learns of objects holding magical power known as Grimoires and the city's power to spawn the undead and mythological creatures. He encounters Guildenstern and his lover Samantha, and learns of the condition known as incomplete death and the Cardinal's true intention for his pursuit of Sydney: <a href="immortality">immortality</a>. The Crimson Blades confront Ashley and reveals his presence to Guildenstern.

Escaping unharmed, Ashley encounters Rosencrantz who intends to join him, though Ashley declines. Rosencrantz tells him of the VKP and the Parliaments' knowledge of the dark powers of Leá Monde, and that the hidden powers deep within a person can be unleashed with the help of the Dark. In his encounters with Sydney, Ashley is shown visions of his past, where his wife Tia and his son Marco are killed by rogues. Meeting Rosencrantz again, Ashley is told that they were not his family, but mistaken targets he killed during a mission of theirs. Ashley's guilt over their deaths was manipulated by the VKP to turn Ashley into a loyal Riskbreaker. Ashley recalls his hidden battle skills and experiences "<a href="clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>", seeing the progress of the Crimson Blades, which leads him to the Great Cathedral.

Sydney had captured Callo earlier and brought her with them. Callo learned that Hardin was skeptical of Sydney's plans. She begins to develop the powers of "heart-seeing", a form of <a href="telepathy">telepathy</a>, as they continue their escape deeper into Leá Monde. With her powers, she learned of Sydney's intentions and Hardin's reason to join Müllenkamp and his closeness to Joshua. Sydney left them to stop the others from advancing; taunting Guildenstern and Samantha, and provoking Ashley to follow him as he intends to bestow his powers upon Ashley. Ashley was not interested in inheriting the powers of Darkness; seeing that Callo had been captured, his only intention is to rescue her.

While discussing the Gran Grimoire, a powerful source of magic, Guildenstern and Samantha discover ancient Kildean letterings carved throughout the city walls. Rosencrantz reveals that the city is the Gran Grimoire and its power lies at the city center: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz, confident in his immunity against Darkness, tries to force Sydney to surrender his powers. Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove that he is not a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness. Sydney refuses to listen and kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor.

Guildenstern continues on to the Great Cathedral in the center of the city, leading him to Callo, Hardin and Joshua. Interrogating Hardin about a certain "key" known as the Blood-Sin, Guildenstern reveals his intentions in acquiring the Dark's powers. Sydney arrives to teleport Hardin and the rest away, leaving him to Guildenstern. Guildenstern acquires the "key" from him and murders Samantha as his sacrifice for the powers of darkness. Ashley arrives later and listens as Sydney reveals his true intentions. Ashley then confronts Guildenstern and manages to defeat him.

Upon Guildenstern's defeat, Ashley, now bearing the "key", carries Sydney out of the collapsing city. The creatures spawned within the city begin to disappear. Callo, Hardin and Joshua escape the city, though Hardin dies and the fate of Callo and Joshua remains unknown. In the epilogue, Ashley goes to visit the ailing Duke Bardorba in his manor, although once they were alone, it was Sydney who was in the room. Sydney tells the duke that he had found a suitable heir to the Darkness in Ashley, and that their plan to inherit the powers of Darkness was successful. The duke then proceeds to kill Sydney, and he himself died soon after of unknown causes. In a report received by the VKP a week after the Graylands Incident, the duke was believed to be murdered, and Ashley became the prime suspect, though he was never found again.

Matsuno, the game's producer and director, preferred to create a new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. "Vagrant Story" is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place "Vagrant Story" into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.
During the design phase, Matsuno was shown photographs from France, particularly Saint-Émilion in the region of <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>. This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-Émilion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting.

Development of the game began in January 1998, spanning two years with manpower that steadily increased from 20 to 50 at peak development phase. The storyline conceived for the game follows Ashley Riot's origins as a dedicated government agent prior to being the titular "<a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">vagrant</a>" who is "involved in many incidents" after the events in Leá Monde. Inspiration for the plot is derived from Hollywood "classic and blockbuster" films as well as European and Asian films. The gameplay was conceived to cater to hardcore gamers who do not "ask for hints and read through strategy guides". However, Matsuno revealed that over half of the game's story was cut due to capacity and development time constraints. Memory issues was considered the most challenging aspect of the game development, with the team forced to adjust the game's interface, texture mapping and polygon mesh in maps, as well as removing gaming elements such as <a href="artificial%20intelligence">AI-controlled</a> supporting non-player characters that would have joined Ashley in the middle of the game.

"Vagrant Story" was conceived during a time when most games had made the transition into <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a>. Games with real-time <a href="polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygons</a> were the mainstream, and it was decided for "Vagrant Story" to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of "Vagrant Story" are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.

A <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> disc of "Vagrant Story" was included in the packaging of "<a href="Legend%20of%20Mana">Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana</a>" in Japan. During the Square Millennium Event held by Square in Tokyo, movies of "Vagrant Story" such as the opening sequence and the weapon crafting system were presented to onlookers. Matsuno stated that a normal playthrough would take the player five to six hours to complete.

In North America, "Vagrant Story" was released as part of Square's "Summer of Adventure" that lasted from May to September 2000. "Vagrant Story" was released with two discs; the first disc is the game itself, while the second disc is a demo disc released by Square to give the player a preview of seven titles. The seven titles include three interactive demos and four non-interactive demos; the former being "<a href="Chocobo%20Racing">Chocobo Racing</a>", "<a href="Front%20Mission%203">Front Mission 3</a>" and "<a href="Threads%20of%20Fate">Threads of Fate</a>", and the latter "<a href="Chrono%20Cross">Chrono Cross</a>", "<a href="SaGa%20Frontier%202">SaGa Frontier 2</a>", "<a href="Chocobo%27s%20Dungeon%202">Chocobo's Dungeon 2</a>" and "Legend of Mana". Both discs were included in the North American release on May 15, 2000. Due to a ruling by the <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> government that video game titles in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> should be sold with both French and English-language instructions, "Vagrant Story"'s release was delayed in Canada. In the European PAL release, the game did not feature the additional demo disc.

On April 13, 2000, <a href="DigiCube">DigiCube</a> published the "<a href="Ultimania">Vagrant Story Ultimania</a>", the official 496-page <a href="strategy%20guide">strategy guide</a> for the game with the . The contents include staff interviews, a detailed background story, and information on monsters and items. On July 20, 2006, the book was republished by Studio BentStuff and Square Enix. Other merchandise include jewellery, T-shirts, cigarette lighters and posters featuring character artwork and CG renders. For the North American release, a 16-page comic-book tie-in with art by Steve Firchow, Clarence Lansang and Michael Turner of <a href="Witchblade">Witchblade</a> fame was published by Eruptor Entertainment and Squaresoft. The comic was freely distributed at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> 2000 and included an interview between Matsuno and Square Electronic Arts assistant product manager Andrew Shiozaki.

The original score for "Vagrant Story" was composed, arranged, and produced by <a href="Hitoshi%20Sakimoto">Hitoshi Sakimoto</a>, whose previous video game works included the soundtracks to "<a href="Radiant%20Silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>", with additional arrangement by <a href="Takeharu%20Ishimoto">Takeharu Ishimoto</a> for Track 2–30 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–31. A Japanese orchestra ensemble, Shinozuka Group, performed for the orchestral piece of Track 2–29. All synthesizing operations are led by Takeharu Ishimoto with assistance from <a href="Hidenori%20Iwasaki">Hidenori Iwasaki</a> for Track 1–1 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–18.

Sakimoto noted that during the initial phase, he composed "bright and cheerful" tunes similar to "Final Fantasy Tactics", but Matsuno emphasized music that was "more deep and heavy". Matsuno also advised him to listen to music from "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" for ideas on ambient scores, and Sakimoto pointed out influences of <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> and <a href="Hans%20Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a> in his compositions. Sakimoto was impressed with the dedication of the development team to the game, and expressed uneasiness trying to come up with music during the game previews. Sakimoto created themes for each character and monster, and made several changes in their melody to reflect their relationships, feelings as well as antagonistic views. The soundtrack for "Vagrant Story" remains to be one of Sakimoto's favorite compositions.

The album was first released on two <a href="Compact%20Disc">Compact Disc</a>s by <a href="DigiCube">DigiCube</a> on March 8, 2000 bearing the catalog number "SSCX-10042". It was subsequently re-released by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> on March 24, 2006 with the catalog number "SQEX-10068/9"; the re-release removed some of the original PlayStation synth reverb, yielding a slightly different version of the audio. The CDs contain 57 tracks, including two remixes and tracks that were not used in the game. Packaged with it is a small booklet featuring interviews with the composer and character artworks.

In May 2000, "Vagrant Story" was the fifth best-selling PlayStation title of the month. 100,000 units were sold in the first 20 days of the game's release, despite being overshadowed by other Square titles like "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IX">Final Fantasy IX</a>" and "<a href="Chrono%20Cross">Chrono Cross</a>". "Vagrant Story" was the third of <a href="Famitsu%23Perfect%20scores">twenty games to date</a>, and the only game on the PlayStation, to receive a perfect score of 40 from "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" <a href="video%20game%20magazine">magazine</a>.

Reviews were generally positive—multimedia news websites <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> praised the gameplay and story. IGN described the story as "so deep and intuitive that it'll likely please fans", and said the battle system maintains "a needed element of strategy and balance". The graphics were seen as a breakaway from the clichés of Square's contemporary titles. Extensive detail was given to the background settings and character expressions. The game's sound effects have been praised as "well done and impressive, straying from Square's synthed noise", as details such as the background audio help create a believable world for the player.

The battle system, however, was described by GameSpot as too complex for beginner players, as even hard-core players require a "comprehensive understanding" of the weapon customization system. IGN pointed out that enemy encounters can be more difficult than boss battles. "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" noted that the game's inventory was too limited for the vast number of customizations possible; this was considered particularly troublesome because some boss enemies are only vulnerable to certain types of weapons.

<a href="Alexander%20O.%20Smith">Alexander O. Smith</a> is responsible for the <a href="English%20language">English</a> <a href="Internationalization%20and%20localization">localization</a> of "Vagrant Story", using <a href="Archaism">archaic</a> English as compared to its straightforward Japanese version. His effort on translating "Vagrant Story" was described by Andrew Vestal as an "unparalleled—and unprecedented—work" of <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> to English video game translation, "in spite of the occasional typo or grammatical hiccup", as quoted by IGN. "Vagrant Story" was awarded "Best PlayStation Game" in the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2000 IGN Awards and was nominated for Best Console Action/Adventure in the 4th Annual Interactive Achievements Awards held by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>.

Three years after its 2000 release, "Vagrant Story" was selected as one of Sony's <a href="Sony%20Greatest%20Hits">Greatest Hits</a>. Games released as Greatest Hits were sold at a lower price, often increasing units sold. "Vagrant Story" is also part of <a href="Square%20Enix%20budget%20ranges%23Ultimate%20Hits">Ultimate Hits</a>, Square Enix's main budget range. The game was later made playable on Sony's <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> consoles when Square Enix announced the title's release on the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a>s in Japan, Europe and North America.

The 2006 role-playing video game "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XII">Final Fantasy XII</a>" contains several references to "Vagrant Story". Terms such as Riskbreaker, Leámonde and Kildea (albeit with different spellings in the localizations), are commonly used in both games. According to an interview with Joypad, a French gaming magazine, in 2004, Yasumi Matsuno claimed during its development that <a href="Ivalice">Ivalice</a>, the game world he created when he joined Square in 1995, is a complex world with a very long history and the stories of "Vagrant Story", "Final Fantasy Tactics", and "Final Fantasy XII" are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map. The original plan, however, was not to place "Vagrant Story" in the Ivalice universe. Matsuno stated in 2011 via his Twitter account that the plot elements of "Final Fantasy Tactics" found in "Vagrant Story" were meant to be intertextual reference to the Ivalice title as a form of "<a href="fan%20service">fan service</a>".

"Vagrant Story" is acknowledged as a game with an "extreme popularity" outside Japan eight years after it was first released. In October 2007, during an interview with the development team responsible for the remake of "Final Fantasy Tactics" for the PlayStation Portable, "", Executive Producer Akitoshi Kawazu was asked about the possibility of a remake or port of the title to the PSP. Kawazu mentioned that it is "the next natural candidate for such an update", although there would be difficulty in porting the game, because it was a title that already pushed the original PlayStation to its technical limits. Kawazu also remarked that bringing the character Ashley Riot into other Ivalice titles would be difficult since, even in "Vagrant Story", "there's really not that much learn(ed) about Ashley Riot".

Peter Warlock

Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 189417 December 1930), known by the <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Peter Warlock, was a British <a href="composer">composer</a> and music critic. The <a href="Warlock">Warlock</a> name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in <a href="occultism">occult practices</a>, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.

As a schoolboy at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, Heseltine met the British composer <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a>, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and <a href="Elizabethan%20era%23High%20culture">Elizabethan</a> music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer <a href="Bernard%20van%20Dieren">Bernard van Dieren</a>; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying <a href="Celts">Celtic culture and language</a>. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine "<a href="The%20Sackbut">The Sackbut</a>". His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at <a href="Eynsford">Eynsford</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>.

Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a> and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of <a href="coal%20gas">coal gas</a> poisoning in 1930, probably <a href="suicide">by his own hand</a>.

Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a>, London, which his parents were using at the time as their town residence. The family was wealthy, with strong artistic connections and some background in classical scholarship. Philip's parents were Arnold Heseltine, a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> in the family firm, and Bessie Mary Edith, née Covernton. She was the daughter of a country doctor from the Welsh border town of <a href="Knighton%2C%20Powys">Knighton</a> and was Arnold's second wife. Soon after Philip's birth, the family moved to <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> where he attended a nearby <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a> and received his first piano lessons.

In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45. Six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones's estate, Cefn Bryntalch, <a href="Llandyssil">Llandyssil</a>, near <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Powys">Montgomery</a>, although the London house was retained. The youthful Philip was proud of his Welsh heritage and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases.

In 1903 Heseltine entered Stone House Preparatory School in <a href="Broadstairs">Broadstairs</a>, where he showed precocious academic ability and won several prizes. In January 1908, at a concert in the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, he heard a performance of "Lebenstanz", composed by Frederick Delius. The work made little impression on him until he discovered that his uncle, Arthur Joseph Heseltine (known as "Joe"), an artist, lived close to Delius's home in <a href="Grez-sur-Loing">Grez-sur-Loing</a> in France. Philip then used the connection to obtain the composer's autograph for Stone House's music teacher, W. E. Brockway.

Heseltine left Stone House in the summer of 1908 and began at Eton College that autumn. His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton, "with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel". He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life, such as the <a href="Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Officers' Training Corps</a>, the suggestive <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, and endemic bullying. He found relief in music and, perhaps because of the connection with his uncle, formed an interest in Delius that developed into a near-obsession. He also found a kindred spirit in an Eton music teacher and Delius advocate, the cellist Edward Mason, from whom Heseltine borrowed a copy of the score of "<a href="Sea%20Drift%20%28Delius%29">Sea Drift</a>". He thought it "heavenly", and was soon requesting funds from his mother to purchase more of Delius's music. According to <a href="Cecil%20Gray%20%28composer%29">Cecil Gray</a>, Heseltine's first biographer, "[Heseltine] did not rest until he had procured every work of Delius which was then accessible".

In June 1911 Heseltine learned that <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London's <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> on the 16th of that month, at which the composer would be present, and his "<a href="Songs%20of%20Sunset">Songs of Sunset</a>" would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a> piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine was introduced to the composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music". He told his mother that "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.

By the summer of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted him to go to university, and then either into the <a href="City%20of%20London">City</a> or the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Civil%20Service">Civil Service</a>, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later. In October 1911 he proceeded to <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> to learn German and to study piano at the <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik%20und%20Tanz%20K%C3%B6ln">conservatory</a>. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in "Railway and Travel Monthly" on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.
In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and engaged a tutor to prepare for his university entrance examinations. He spent time with Delius at that summer's Birmingham Festival, and published his first music criticism, an article on <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> that appeared in the "Musical Standard" in September 1912. Despite his mother's wishes and his lack of formal musical training, he hoped to make a career in music. He consulted Delius, who advised him that, if his mind was set, he should follow his instincts and pursue this objective in the face of all other considerations. Beecham, who knew both men, later sharply criticised this advice, on the grounds of Heseltine's immaturity and instability. "Frederick should never have committed the psychological blunder of preaching the doctrine of relentless determination to someone incapable of receiving it". In the end Heseltine acceded to his mother's wishes. After passing the necessary examinations, he was accepted to study classics at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, and began there in October 1913.

A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine as "probably about 22, but he appears to be years older ... 6 feet high, absolutely fit ... brilliant blue eyes ... and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God". Although he enjoyed social success, he soon became depressed and unhappy with Oxford life. In April 1914 he spent part of his Easter vacation with Delius at Grez, and worked with the composer on the scores of "An Arabesque" and "<a href="Fennimore%20and%20Gerda">Fennimore and Gerda</a>", in the latter case providing an English version of the <a href="libretto">libretto</a>. He did not return to Oxford after the 1914 summer vacation; with his mother's reluctant consent he moved to <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> in London, and enrolled at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> to study language, literature and philosophy. In his spare time he conducted a small amateur orchestra in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>, after admitting to Delius that he knew nothing of the art of conducting. However, his life as a student in London was brief; in February 1915, with the help of <a href="Maud%20Cunard">Lady Emerald Cunard</a> (a mistress of Beecham) he secured a job as a music critic for the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" at a salary of £100 per year. He promptly abandoned his university studies to begin this new career.

During Heseltine's four months at the "Daily Mail", he wrote about 30 notices, mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis. His first contribution, dated 9 February 1915, described a performance by <a href="Benno%20Moiseiwitsch">Benno Moiseiwitsch</a> of Delius's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Delius%29">Piano Concerto in C minor</a>, as "masterly", while Delius was hailed as "the greatest composer England has produced for two centuries". The other work in the programme was "the last great symphony that has been delivered to the world": the <a href="Symphony%20in%20D%20minor%20%28Franck%29">Symphony in D minor</a> by <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">Franck</a>. He wrote for other publications; a 5000-word article, "Some notes on Delius and his Music", appeared in the March 1915 issue of "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>", in which Heseltine opined: "There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all". Only Beecham, Heseltine suggested, was capable of interpreting the music adequately. Heseltine's last notice for the "Daily Mail" was dated 17 June; later that month he resigned, frustrated by the paper's frequent cutting of his more critical opinions. Unemployed, he spent his days in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, studying and editing Elizabethan music.

Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the <a href="Vale%20of%20Evesham">Vale of Evesham</a>, with a party that included a young <a href="Model%20%28art%29">artist's model</a> named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as "Puma" because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair. During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle naked down nearby <a href="Crickley%20Hill%20and%20Barrow%20Wake">Crickley Hill</a>. However, his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any clear sense of purpose. In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be "the greatest literary genius of his generation", and enthusiastically fell in with the writer's plans to found a <a href="Utopian%20socialism">Utopian</a> colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them. Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled; when she revealed that she was pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child.

In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London, ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service. However, it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence; in a letter to his friend <a href="Robert%20Nichols%20%28poet%29">Robert Nichols</a>, Heseltine described Lawrence as "a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is". The social centre of Heseltine's life now became the <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20Royal">Café Royal</a> in <a href="Regent%20Street">Regent Street</a>, where among others he met Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a> studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine, and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be "no compromise with the mob". Beecham ridiculed the plan; he said it would "be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life".

An event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life, late in 1916, was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren. This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine, who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music. In November 1916 Heseltine used the pseudonym "Peter Warlock" for the first time, in an article on <a href="Sir%20Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Sir Eugene Aynsley Goossens</a>' chamber music for "The Music Student".

Puma bore a son in July 1916, though there is confusion about the child's exact identity. Most biographers assumed him to be <a href="Nigel%20Heseltine">Nigel Heseltine</a>, the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992. However, in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother; he was, he says, the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl. Subsequently, he was given to foster-parents, then adopted by Heseltine's mother. Parrott records that the son born to Puma was called Peter, and died in infancy. Smith, however, states that Puma's baby was originally called Peter but was renamed Nigel "for reasons which have not as yet been satisfactorily explained". Whatever the truth of the paternity, and in spite of their mutual misgivings, Heseltine and Puma were married at <a href="Chelsea%20Register%20Office">Chelsea Register Office</a> on 22 December 1916.

By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> fortunes in <a href="World%20War%20I">the war</a> stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.

In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was "tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books "full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination"; these works included <a href="Eliphas%20Levi">Eliphas Levi's</a> "History of Transcendental Magic", which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met <a href="W.B.%20Yeats">W.B. Yeats</a>, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer <a href="Denis%20ApIvor">Denis ApIvor</a> has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophist</a> group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by <a href="Kaikhosru%20Shapurji%20Sorabji">Kaikhosru Sorabji</a>, the composer who had introduced him to the music of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a>.

On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, "What Music Is", at Dublin's <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>, which included musical excerpts from Bartók, the French composer <a href="Paul%20Ladmirault">Paul Ladmirault</a>, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered to be among his finest work.

When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as "Peter Warlock". They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer <a href="Charles%20Wilfred%20Orr">Charles Wilfred Orr</a> recalled Heseltine as "a tall fair youth of about my own age", trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of Van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as "flute-like in quality and purity".

For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism. In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association, "The Modern Spirit in Music", that impressed <a href="Edward%20Joseph%20Dent">E.J. Dent</a>, the future <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> music professor. However, much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome. He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism ("the average newspaper critic of music ... is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician, or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting") which offended senior critics such as <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>. He wrote provocative articles in the "Musical Times", and in July 1919 feuded with the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>.

In a letter dated 17 July 1919, Delius advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing: "I ... know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you". By this time Heseltine's privately expressed opinions on Delius's music were increasingly critical, although in public he continued to sing his former mentor's praises. In "The Musical Times" he cited "Fennimore and Gerda", Delius's final opera, as "one of the most successful experiments in a new direction that the operatic stage has yet seen".

Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine, which he intended to start as soon as he found appropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine "The Organist and Choirmaster", with a new music journal, "The Sackbut", and invited Heseltine to edit it. Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial. "The Sackbut" also organised concerts, presenting works by Van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others. However, Rogers withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled to run it himself for several months; in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor with <a href="Ursula%20Greville">Ursula Greville</a>.

With no regular income, in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to Cefn Bryntalch, which became his base for the next three years. He found the atmosphere there conducive to creative efforts; he told Gray that "Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman". The Welsh years were marked by intense creative compositional and literary activity; some of Heseltine's best-known music, including the song-cycles "Lilligay" and "<a href="The%20Curlew">The Curlew</a>", were completed along with numerous songs, choral settings, and a string serenade composed to honour Delius's 60th birthday in 1922. Heseltine also edited and transcribed a large amount of early English music. His recognition as an emerging composer was marked by the selection of "The Curlew" as representing contemporary British music at the 1924 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>.

Heseltine's major literary work of this period was a biography of Delius, the first full-length study of the composer, which remained the standard work for many years. On its 1952 reissue, the book was described by music publisher <a href="Hubert%20J.%20Foss">Hubert J. Foss</a> as "a work of art, a charming and penetrating study of a musical poet's mind". Heseltine also worked with Gray on a study of the 16th-century Italian composer <a href="Carlo%20Gesualdo">Carlo Gesualdo</a>, although disputes between the two men delayed the book's publication until 1926.

While visiting <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> in April 1921, Heseltine befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist Béla Bartók. When Bartók visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert, he stayed for a few days at Cefn Bryntalch. Although Heseltine continued to promote Bartók's music, there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit. Heseltine's on-off friendship with Lawrence finally died, after a thinly disguised and unflattering depiction of Heseltine and Puma ("Halliday" and "Pussum") appeared in "<a href="Women%20in%20Love">Women in Love</a>", published in 1922. Heseltine began legal proceedings for defamation, eventually settling out of court with the publishers, <a href="Secker%20and%20Warburg">Secker and Warburg</a>. Puma, meanwhile, had disappeared from Heseltine's life. She returned from Ireland before he did, and had lived for a while with the young child Nigel at Cefn Bryntalch where the local gentry considered her "not of the same order of society as we are". There was no resumption of married life, and she left Heseltine sometime in 1922.

In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer <a href="E.J.%20Moeran">E.J. Moeran</a> on a tour of eastern England, in search of original folk music. Later that year he and Gray visited Delius at Grez. In June 1924 Heseltine left Cefn Bryntalch and lived briefly in a Chelsea flat, a stay marked by wild parties and considerable damage to the property. After spending Christmas 1924 in <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a> he leased a cottage (formerly occupied by Foss) in the Kent village of Eynsford.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a <a href="bohemian">bohemian</a> household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, "Maltworms". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> who acted as a general . Peache was described by Delius's assistant <a href="Eric%20Fenby">Eric Fenby</a> as "a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers <a href="William%20Walton">William Walton</a> and <a href="Constant%20Lambert">Constant Lambert</a>, the artist <a href="Nina%20Hamnett">Nina Hamnett</a>, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.

The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the "Five Bells" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the <a href="Jacobean%20Literature">Jacobean</a> dramatist <a href="John%20Webster">John Webster</a> and the modern poet <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>, and the "<a href="Capriol%20Suite">Capriol Suite</a>" in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, <a href="Thomas%20Whythorne">Thomas Whythorne</a>, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in "The History of Music in England". He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, "The English Ayre".

In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the <a href="National%20Gramophonic%20Society">National Gramophonic Society</a>, by <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a> and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, <a href="His%20Master%27s%20Voice">HMV</a> recorded the ballad "Captain Stratton's Fancy", sung by <a href="Peter%20Dawson%20%28bass-baritone%29">Peter Dawson</a>. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist <a href="Bruce%20Blunt">Bruce Blunt</a> led to the popular Christmas anthem "<a href="Bethlehem%20Down">Bethlehem Down</a>", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.

By November 1928, Heseltine had tired of Cefn Bryntalch, and returned to London. He sought concert reviewing and cataloguing assignments without much success; his main creative activity was the editing, under the pseudonym "Rab Noolas" ("Saloon Bar" backwards), of "Merry-Go-Down", an anthology in praise of drinking. The book, published by The Mandrake Press, was copiously illustrated by Hal Collins.

Early in 1929 Heseltine received two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored his sense of purpose. Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927; he now invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal. Beecham also asked Heseltine to help organise a festival to honour Delius, which the conductor was planning for October 1929. Although Heseltine's enthusiasm for Delius's music had diminished, he accepted the assignment, and travelled to Grez in search of forgotten compositions that could be resurrected for the festival. He declared that he was delighted to discover <a href="Cynara%20%28Delius%29">"Cynara"</a>, for voice and orchestra, abandoned since 1907. For the festival, Heseltine prepared many of the programme notes for individual concerts and supplied a concise biography of the composer. According to Delius's wife <a href="Jelka%20Rosen">Jelka</a>: "Next to Beecham, he [Heseltine] really was the soul of the thing".

At a <a href="The%20Proms">Promenade Concert</a> in August 1929, Heseltine conducted a performance of the "Capriol Suite", the single public conducting engagement of his life. In an effort to reproduce their success with "Bethlehem Down", he and Blunt proffered a new carol for Christmas 1929, "The Frostbound Wood". Although the work was technically accomplished, it failed to achieve the popularity of its predecessor. Heseltine edited three issues of the ILO journal, but in January 1930, Beecham announced the closure of the venture, and Heseltine was out of work again. His attempt on behalf of Van Dieren to raise financing to mount a performance of the latter's opera "The Tailor" also failed.

The final summer of Heseltine's life was marked by gloom, depression, and inactivity; ApIvor refers to Heseltine's sense of "crimes against the spirit", and an obsession with imminent death. In July 1930 a fortnight spent with Blunt in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> brought a brief creative revival; Heseltine composed "The Fox" to Blunt's lyrics, and on his return to London he wrote "The Fairest May" for voice and string quartet. These were his final original compositions.

In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a <a href="Tite%20Street">Tite Street</a> in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer <a href="Cipriani%20Potter">Cipriani Potter</a>, and made a solo version of "Bethlehem Down" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.

An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.

Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at <a href="Godalming">Godalming</a> cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a>; a second such concert took place in the following December.

In 2011 the art critic <a href="Brian%20Sewell">Brian Sewell</a> published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.

Heseltine's surviving body of work includes about 150 songs, mostly for solo voice and piano. He also wrote choral pieces, some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, and a few purely instrumental works. Among lost or destroyed works the musicologist Ian Copley lists two stage pieces: sketches for the abandoned opera "Liadain and Curither", and the draft of a mime-drama "Twilight" (1926) which Heseltine destroyed on the advice of Delius. Music historian Stephen Banfield described the songs as "polished gems of English art song forming a pinnacle of that genre's brilliant brief revival in the early 20th century ... [works of] intensity, consistency and unfailing excellence". According to Delius's biographer <a href="Christopher%20Palmer">Christopher Palmer</a>, Heseltine influenced the work of fellow-composers Moeran and Orr, and to a lesser extent Lambert and Walton, primarily by bringing them within the Delius orbit. In the case of the latter pair, Palmer argues, "those reminiscences of Delius which crop up from time to time in [their] music ... are more probably Delius filtered through Warlock".

Heseltine biographer Brian Collins considers the composer a prime mover in the 20th-century renaissance of early English music; apart from much writing on the subject, he made well over 500 transcriptions of early works. He also wrote or contributed to ten books, and wrote dozens of general music articles and reviews. Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: "In the memory of his friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last of us are dead". During his Eynsford years, Heseltine had provided his own epitaph:
In the early 20th century the German-influenced 19th-century song-writing traditions generally followed by <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a>, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>, <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a> and <a href="Roger%20Quilter">Roger Quilter</a>, were in a process of eclipse. For composers such as <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a>, English folk-song became a dominant feature of their work; at the same time, songwriters were seeking to extend their art by moving beyond the piano to develop richer forms of vocal accompaniment. Thus, as Copley observes, at the outset of his career as a composer Heseltine found in song-writing a dynamic ambience, "within which he could express himself, or against which he could react".

By the time Heseltine began composing seriously, around 1915–16, he had started to shake off the overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study Elizabethan and Jacobean music. In 1916 he came under the spell of Van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the "Saudades" song cycle of 1916–17. Gray writes that from Van Dieren, Heseltine "learned to purify and organise his harmonic texture ... and the thick, muddy chords which characterised the early songs gave place to clear and vigorous part-writing". "In 1917–18 Heseltine's passion for Celtic culture, stimulated by his stay in Ireland, brought a new element to his music, and in 1921 he discovered Bartók. A late passion was the music of <a href="John%20Dowland">John Dowland</a>, the Elizabethan <a href="lute">lute</a>nist, one of whose dances he arranged for brass band. These constituent parts contributed to the individual style of Heseltine's music. Gray summarised this style thus;

They [the differing elements] are fused together in a curiously personal way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the ultimate product, which is not Dowland "plus" Van Dieren or Elizabethan "plus" modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable—Peter Warlock. No one else could have written it.

Apart from those within his circle, Heseltine drew inspiration from other composers whose work he respected: <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>, and <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow song-writer <a href="Hugo%20Wolf">Hugo Wolf</a>. Heseltine's songs demonstrate moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel the idea of a split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory was rejected by the composer's friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of "Philip drunk or Philip sober".

In a summary of the Warlock oeuvre, Copley asserts that Heseltine was a natural melodist in the Schubert mould: "With very few exceptions his melodies will stand on their own ... they can be sung by themselves with no accompaniment, as complete and satisfing as folk-songs". Copley identifies certain characteristic motifs or "fingerprints", which recur throughout the works and which are used to depict differences of mood and atmosphere: anguish, resignation but also warmth, tenderness and amorous dalliance. The music critic Ernest Bradbury comments that Heseltine's songs "serve both singer and poet, the one in their memorably tuneful vocal lines, the other in a scrupulous regard for correct accentuation free from any suggestion of pedantry".

In musical parlance Heseltine was a miniaturist, a title which he was happy to accept in disregard of the sometimes derogatory implications of the label: "I have neither the impulse nor the ability to erect monuments before which a new generation will bow down". He was almost entirely self-taught, avoiding through his lack of a formal <a href="Music%20school">conservatory</a> training the "teutonic shadow"—the influence of the German masters. To the charge that his technique was "amateurish", he responded by arguing that a composer should express himself in his own terms, not by "string[ing] together a number of tags and clichés culled from the work of others". His compositions were themselves part of a learning process; "The Curlew" song cycle originated in 1915 with the setting of a Yeats poem, but did not reach completion until 1922. Brian Collins characterises this work as "a chronicle of [the composer's] progress and development".

Heseltine's music was generally well received by public and critics. The first Warlock compositions to attract critical attention were three of the Dublin songs which Rogers published in 1918. William Child in "The Musical Times" thought these "first rate", and singled out "If Ever I Saw" as having particular distinction. In 1922, in the same magazine, the short song cycle "Mr Belloc's Fancy" was likewise praised, especially "Warlock's rattling good tunes and appropriately full-blooded accompaniment". Ralph Vaughan Williams was delighted with the reception accorded to the "Three Carols", when he conducted the <a href="The%20Bach%20Choir">Bach Choir</a> at the Queen's Hall in December 1923. Early in 1925 the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a> broadcast a performance of the Serenade for string orchestra written to honour Delius, a sign, says Smith, that the music establishment was beginning to take Warlock seriously. Heseltine himself noted the warmth of the Prom audience's reaction to his conducting of the "Capriol Suite" in 1929: "I was recalled four times".

After Heseltine's death, assessments of his musical stature were generous. Newman considered some of Heseltine's choral compositions "among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman." Constant Lambert hailed him as "one of the greatest song-writers that music has ever known", a view echoed by Copley. In a tribute published in "The Musical Times", Van Dieren referred to Heseltine's music as "a national treasure" that would long survive all that was currently being said or written about it. In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance in <a href="Interwar%20period">the inter-war years</a> became obscured. However, when the Peter Warlock Society was created in 1963, interest in his music began to increase. Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, "frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative to the point of being revolutionary".

As well as a large output of musical journalism and criticism, Heseltine wrote or was significantly involved in the production of 10 books or long pamphlets:

At the time of his death Heseltine was planning to write a life of John Dowland.

Impala

The impala (, "Aepyceros melampus") is a medium-sized <a href="antelope">antelope</a> found in <a href="East%20Africa">eastern</a> and <a href="southern%20Africa">southern Africa</a>. The <a href="monotypic%20species">sole member</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Aepyceros", it was first <a href="scientific%20description">described</a> to European audiences by German zoologist <a href="Hinrich%20Lichtenstein">Hinrich Lichtenstein</a> in 1812. Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised—the common impala, and the larger and darker black-faced impala. The impala reaches at the shoulder and weighs . It features a glossy, reddish brown <a href="coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a>. The male's slender, <a href="lyre">lyre</a>-shaped <a href="Horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a> are long.

Active mainly <a href="diurnality">during the day</a>, the impala may be <a href="gregarious">gregarious</a> or <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> depending upon the climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-<a href="predation">predator</a> strategy. <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">Browsers</a> as well as grazers, impala feed on <a href="monocot">monocot</a>s, <a href="dicot">dicot</a>s, <a href="forb">forb</a>s, <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s and <a href="Acacieae">acacia</a> pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a> takes place toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a>, and the victorious male courts female in <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a>. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are <a href="lactation">suckled</a> for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.

The impala is found in woodlands and sometimes on the interface (<a href="ecotone">ecotone</a>) between woodlands and <a href="savanna">savanna</a>hs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="Kaokoland">Kaokoland</a> in northwestern <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Namibia">Namibia</a>, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Gabon">Gabon</a> and southern Africa. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) classifies the impala as a <a href="least%20concern">species of least concern</a>; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.

The first attested English name, in 1802, was palla or pallah, from the <a href="Tswana%20language">Tswana</a> ' 'red antelope'; the name "impala", also spelled "impalla" or "mpala", is first attested in 1875. Its <a href="Afrikaans%20language">Afrikaans</a> name, ' 'red buck', is also sometimes used in English.

The <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific</a> <a href="generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> "Aepyceros" ( ‘high-horned’) comes from <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a> (', 'high, steep') + (', 'horn'); the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "melampus" ( ‘black-foot’) from (', 'black') + (', 'foot').

The impala is the <a href="monotypic%20species">sole member</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Aepyceros" and belongs to the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. It was first <a href="scientific%20description">described</a> by German zoologist <a href="Martin%20Hinrich%20Carl%20Lichtenstein">Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein</a> in 1812. In 1984, palaeontologist <a href="Elisabeth%20Vrba">Elisabeth Vrba</a> opined that the impala is a <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the <a href="Alcelaphinae">alcelaphines</a>, given its resemblance to the <a href="hartebeest">hartebeest</a>. A 1999 <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the <a href="Centre%20national%20de%20la%20recherche%20scientifique">National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris</a>) and colleagues, based on <a href="mtDNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> analyses, showed that the impala forms a <a href="clade">clade</a> with the <a href="suni">suni</a> ("Neotragus moschatus"). This clade is sister to another formed by the <a href="bay%20duiker">bay duiker</a> ("Cephalophus dorsalis") and the <a href="klipspringer">klipspringer</a> ("Oreotragus oreotragus"). An <a href="rRNA">rRNA</a> and <a href="spectrin">β-spectrin</a> nuclear sequence analysis in 2003 also supported an association between "Aepyceros" and "<a href="Nesotragus">Nesotragus</a>". The following cladogram is based on the 1999 study:

Up to six <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described, although only two are generally recognised on the basis of mitochondrial data. Though morphologically similar, the subspecies show a significant <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> between them, and no <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> between them have been reported.

According to Vrba, the impala developed from an alcelaphine ancestor. She noted that while this ancestor has <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form for at least five million years. Several <a href="fossil">fossil</a> species have been discovered, including "<a href="Aepyceros%20datoadeni">A. datoadeni</a>" from the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise very similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against <a href="tick">tick</a>s and <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship with the tick-feeding <a href="oxpecker">oxpecker</a>s could have played a role in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.

The impala is a medium-sized, slender <a href="antelope">antelope</a> similar to the <a href="kob">kob</a> or <a href="Grant%27s%20gazelle">Grant's gazelle</a> in build. The head-and-body length is around . Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females are tall. Males typically weigh and females . <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexually dimorphic</a>, females are hornless and smaller than males. Males grow slender, lyre-shaped horns long. The horns, strongly ridged and divergent, are circular in section and hollow at the base. Their arch-like structure allows interlocking of horns, which helps a male throw off his opponent during fights; horns also protect the skull from damage.

The glossy coat of the impala shows two-tone colourationthe reddish brown back and the tan flanks; these are in sharp contrast to the white underbelly. Facial features include white rings around the eyes and a light chin and <a href="snout">snout</a>. The ears, long, are tipped with black. Black streaks run from the buttocks to the upper hindlegs. The bushy white tail, long, features a solid black stripe along the midline. The impala's colouration bears a strong resemblance to the <a href="gerenuk">gerenuk</a>, which has shorter horns and lacks the black thigh stripes of the impala. The impala has <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a>s covered by a black tuft of hair on the hindlegs. <a href="Sebaceous%20gland">Sebaceous gland</a>s concentrated on the forehead and dispersed on the torso of dominant males are most active during the mating season, while those of females are only partially developed and do not undergo seasonal changes. There are four <a href="mammary%20gland">nipples</a>.

Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is significantly larger and darker than the common impala; <a href="melanism">melanism</a> is responsible for the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, on either side of the nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.

The impala has a special dental arrangement on the front lower jaw similar to the <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> seen in <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine primates</a>, which is used during <a href="allogrooming">allogrooming</a> to comb the fur on the head and the neck and remove <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a>s.

The impala is <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> (active mainly during the day), though activity tends to cease during the hot midday hours; they feed and rest at night. Three distinct social groups can be observedthe <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> males, bachelor herds and female herds. The territorial males hold territories where they may form <a href="Harem%20%28zoology%29">harems</a> of females; territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders. Bachelor herds tend to be small, with less than 30 members. Individuals maintain distances of from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar. Female herds vary in size from 6 to 100; herds occupy <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s of . The mother–calf bond is weak, and breaks soon after weaning; juveniles leave the herds of their mothers to join other herds. Female herds tend to be loose and have no obvious leadership. Allogrooming is an important means of social interaction in bachelor and female herds; in fact, the impala appears to be the only <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a> to display self-grooming as well as allogrooming. In allogrooming, females typically groom related impalas, while males associate with unrelated ones. Each partner grooms the other six to twelve times.

Social behaviour is influenced by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the <a href="Serengeti%20National%20Park">Serengeti National Park</a> showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.

The impala is an important <a href="predation">prey</a> species for several <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s, such as <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a>s, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s and <a href="lion">lion</a>s. The antelope displays two characteristic leapsit can jump up to , over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to ; the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators. At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape the eye of the predator. The most prominent vocalisation is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to away. Scent gland secretions identify a territorial male. Impalas are sedentary; adult and middle-aged males, in particular, can hold their territories for years.

Common <a href="Ixodidae">ixodid</a> ticks collected from impala include "<a href="Amblyomma%20hebraeum">Amblyomma hebraeum</a>", "<a href="Boophilus%20decoloratus">Boophilus decoloratus</a>", "<a href="Hyalomma%20marginatum">Hyalomma marginatum</a>", "<a href="Ixodes%20cavipalpus">Ixodes cavipalpus</a>", "<a href="Rhipicephalus%20appendiculatus">Rhipicephalus appendiculatus</a>" and "<a href="Rhipicephalus%20evertsi">R. evertsi</a>". In <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, heavy infestation by ticks such as "R. appendiculatus" has proved to be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to <a href="tick%20paralysis">tick paralysis</a>. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.

Impala are symbiotically related to <a href="oxpecker">oxpecker</a>s, which feed on ticks from those parts of the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, forehead and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as <a href="Coke%27s%20hartebeest">Coke's hartebeest</a>, Grant's gazelle, <a href="Thompson%27s%20gazelle">Thompson's gazelle</a> and <a href="topi">topi</a>. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.

<a href="Louse">Lice</a> recorded from impala include "<a href="Damalinia%20aepycerus">Damalinia aepycerus</a>", "<a href="Damalinia%20elongata">D. elongata</a>", "<a href="Linognathus%20aepycerus">Linognathus aepycerus</a>" and "<a href="Linognathus%20nevilli">L. nevilli</a>"; in a study, <a href="ivermectin">ivermectin</a> (a medication against parasites) was found to have an effect on "Boophilus decoloratus" and "Linognathus" species, though not on "Damalinia" species. In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of <a href="worm">worm</a>s in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as "<a href="Cooperia%20%28nematode%29">Cooperia</a>", "<a href="Cooperoides">Cooperoides</a>", "<a href="Fasciola">Fasciola</a>", "<a href="Gongylonema">Gongylonema</a>". "<a href="Haemonchus">Haemonchus</a>", "<a href="Impalaia">Impalaia</a>", "<a href="Longistrongylus">Longistrongylus</a>" and "<a href="Trichostrongylus">Trichostrongylus</a>"; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.

Impala <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browse</a> as well as graze; either may predominate, depending upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises <a href="monocot">monocot</a>s, <a href="dicot">dicot</a>s, <a href="forb">forb</a>s, fruits and "<a href="Acacieae">acacia</a>" pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to <a href="succulent%20plant">succulent vegetation</a> if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.

Impala feed on soft and nutritious grasses such as "<a href="Digitaria%20macroblephara">Digitaria macroblephara</a>"; tough, tall grasses, such as "<a href="Heteropogon%20contortus">Heteropogon contortus</a>" and "<a href="Themeda%20triandra">Themeda triandra</a>", are typically avoided. Impala on the periphery of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).

Males are <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexually mature</a> by the time they are a year old, though successful mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are a year and a half old; <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a> lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>, typically in May. <a href="Gonad">Gonad</a>al growth and <a href="hormone">hormone</a> production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The <a href="bulbourethral%20gland">bulbourethral gland</a>s are heavier, <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.

<a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">Rutting</a> males fight over dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a> their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, probably to devote more time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female's urine to ensure that she is in oestrus. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the <a href="Courtship%20display">courtship</a> by pursuing her, keeping a distance of from her. The male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously; the female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to one side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males.

<a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> lasts six to seven months. Births generally occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the first few weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.

The impala inhabits woodlands due to its preference for shade; it can also occur on the interface (<a href="ecotone">ecotone</a>) between woodlands and <a href="savanna">savanna</a>hs. Places close to water sources are preferred. In southern Africa, populations tend to be associated with "<a href="Colophospermum%20mopane">Colophospermum mopane</a>" and "Acacia" woodlands. Habitat choices differ seasonally"<a href="Acacia%20senegal">Acacia senegal</a>" woodlands are preferred in the wet season, and "<a href="Acacia%20drepanolobium">A. drepanolobium</a>" savannahs in the dry season. Another factor that could influence habitat choice is vulnerability to predators; impala tend to keep away from areas with tall grasses as predators could be concealed there. A study found that the reduction of woodland cover and creation of shrublands by the <a href="African%20bush%20elephant">African bush elephant</a>s has favoured impala population by increasing the availability of more dry season browse. Earlier, the "<a href="Baikiaea">Baikiaea</a>" woodland, which has now declined due to elephants, provided minimum browsing for impala. The newly formed "<a href="Capparis">Capparis</a>" shrubland, on the other hand, could be a key browsing habitat. Impala are generally not associated with <a href="Montane%20grasslands%20and%20shrublands">montane</a> habitats; however, in <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>, impala have been recorded at altitudes of up to <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>.

The historical range of the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Burundi">Burundi</a>. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Uganda">Uganda</a> in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and <a href="Kaokoland">Kaokoland</a> in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in <a href="Wildlife%20of%20Gabon">Gabon</a> and across southern Africa.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> (IUCN) classifies the impala as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> overall. The black-faced impala, however, is classified as a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats to the survival of the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, <a href="Species%20translocation">translocation</a> of the black-faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation.

Around a quarter of the common impala populations occur in protected areas, such as the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a> (<a href="Wildlife%20of%20Botswana">Botswana</a>); <a href="Masai%20Mara">Masai Mara</a> and <a href="Kajiado">Kajiado</a> (Kenya); <a href="Kruger%20National%20Park">Kruger National Park</a> (South Africa); the <a href="Ruaha%20National%20Park">Ruaha</a> and <a href="Serengeti%20National%20Park">Serengeti National Park</a>s and <a href="Selous%20Game%20Reserve">Selous Game Reserve</a> (<a href="Wildlife%20of%20Tanzania">Tanzania</a>); <a href="Luangwa%20Valley">Luangwa Valley</a> (<a href="Wildlife%20of%20Zambia">Zambia</a>); <a href="Hwange%20National%20Park">Hwange</a>, <a href="Sebungwe">Sebungwe</a> and <a href="Zambezi%20Valley">Zambezi Valley</a> (<a href="Wildlife%20of%20Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>). The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the <a href="Etosha%20National%20Park">Etosha National Park</a>. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in <a href="Mkomazi%20National%20Park">Mkomazi National Park</a> (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near <a href="Lake%20Kariba">Lake Kariba</a> (Zimbabwe).

The Cloisters

The Cloisters is a museum in <a href="Fort%20Tryon%20Park">Fort Tryon Park</a> in <a href="Washington%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan">Washington Heights, Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, specializing in European medieval architecture, sculpture and decorative arts, with a focus on the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> and <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> periods. Governed by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, it contains a large collection of medieval artworks shown in the architectural settings of French monasteries and abbeys. Its buildings are centered around four <a href="cloisters">cloisters</a>—the Cuxa, Saint-Guilhem, Bonnefont and Trie—which were purchased by American sculptor and art dealer <a href="George%20Grey%20Barnard">George Grey Barnard</a>, dismantled in Europe between 1934 and 1939, and moved to New York. They were acquired for the museum by financier and philanthropist <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%2C%20Jr.">John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a> Other major sources of objects were the collections of <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Brummer">Joseph Brummer</a>.

The museum's building was designed by architect <a href="Charles%20Collens">Charles Collens</a>, on a site on a steep hill, with upper and lower levels. It contains medieval gardens and a series of chapels and themed galleries, including the Romanesque, Fuentidueña, Unicorn, Spanish and Gothic rooms. The design, layout and ambiance of the building is intended to evoke a sense of medieval European monastic life.

It holds about 5,000 works of art and architecture, all European and mostly dating from the <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> to the <a href="Renaissance%20art">early Renaissance</a> periods, mainly during the 12th through 15th centuries. The varied objects include stone and wood sculptures, <a href="tapestries">tapestries</a>, <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s and panel paintings, of which the best known include the c. 1422 <a href="Early%20Netherlandish">Early Netherlandish</a> "<a href="M%C3%A9rode%20Altarpiece">Mérode Altarpiece</a>" and the c. 1495–1505 <a href="Flemish">Flemish</a> "<a href="Hunt%20of%20the%20Unicorn">Hunt of the Unicorn</a>" tapestries.

Rockefeller purchased the museum site in Washington Heights in 1930, and donated it and the Bayard collection to the Metropolitan in 1931. Upon its opening on May 10, 1938, the Cloisters was described as a collection "shown informally in a picturesque setting, which stimulates imagination and creates a receptive mood for enjoyment".

The basis for the museum's architectural structure came from the collection of George Grey Barnard, an American sculptor and collector who almost single-handedly established a <a href="medieval%20art">medieval art</a> museum near his home in the <a href="Fort%20Washington%20%28New%20York%29">Fort Washington</a> section of <a href="Upper%20Manhattan">Upper Manhattan</a>. Although he was a successful sculptor who had studied at the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, his income was not enough to support his family. Barnard was a risk taker and led most of his life on the edge of poverty. He moved to Paris in 1883 where he studied at the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Académie des Beaux-Arts</a>. He lived in the village of <a href="Moret-sur-Loing">Moret-sur-Loing</a>, near <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>, between 1905 and 1913, and began to deal in 13th- and 14th-century European objects to supplement his earnings. In the process he built a large personal collection of what he described as "antiques", at first by buying and selling stand-alone objects with French dealers, then by the acquisition of "in situ" architectural artifacts from local farmers.
Barnard was primarily interested in the abbeys and churches founded by monastic orders from the 12th century. Following centuries of pillage and destruction during wars and revolutions, stones from many of these buildings were reused by local populations. A pioneer in seeing the value in such artifacts, Barnard often met with hostility to his effort from local and governmental groups. Yet he was an astute negotiator who had the advantage of a professional sculptor's eye for superior stone carving, and by 1907 he had built a high-quality collection at relatively low cost. Reputedly he paid $25,000 for the Trie buildings, $25,000 for the Bonnefort and $100,000 for the Cuxa cloisters. His success led him to adopt a somewhat romantic view of himself. He recalled bicycling across the French countryside and unearthing fallen and long-forgotten Gothic masterworks along the way. He claimed to have found the tomb effigy of Jean d'Alluye face down, in use as a bridge over a small stream. By 1914 he had gathered enough artifacts to open a gallery in Manhattan.
Barnard often neglected his personal finances, and was so disorganized that he often misplaced the origin or provenance of his purchases. He sold his collection to <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%20Jr.">John D. Rockefeller Jr.</a> in 1925 during one of his recurring monetary crises. The two had been introduced by the architect <a href="William%20W.%20Bosworth">William W. Bosworth</a>. Purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the acquisition included structures that would become the foundation and core of the museum. Rockefeller and Barnard were polar opposites in both temperament and outlook and did not get along; Rockefeller was reserved, Barnard exuberant. The English painter and art critic <a href="Roger%20Fry">Roger Fry</a> was then the Metropolitan's chief European acquisition agent and acted as an intermediary. Rockefeller eventually acquired Barnard's collection for around $700,000, retaining Barnard as an advisor.

In 1927 Rockefeller hired <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted%20Jr.">Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.</a>, son of one of the designers of <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, and the <a href="Olmsted%20Brothers">Olmsted Brothers</a> firm to create a park in the Fort Washington area. In February 1930 Rockefeller offered to build the Cloisters for the Metropolitan. Under consultation with Bosworth, he decided to build the museum at a site at Fort Tryon Park, which they choose for its elevation, views, and accessible but isolated location. The land and existing buildings were purchased that year from the <a href="C.%20K.%20G.%20Billings">C. K. G. Billings</a> estate and other holdings in the Fort Washington area. The Cloisters building and adjacent gardens were designed by Charles Collens. They incorporate elements from abbeys in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> and France. Parts from <a href="Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa">Sant Miquel de Cuixà</a>, <a href="Saint-Guilhem-le-D%C3%A9sert">Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert</a>, <a href="Proupiary">Bonnefont-en-Comminges</a>, Trie-sur-Baïse and <a href="Froville">Froville</a> were disassembled stone-by-stone and shipped to New York City, where they were reconstructed and integrated into a cohesive whole. Construction took place over a five-year period from 1934. Rockefeller bought several hundred acres of the <a href="The%20Palisades%20%28Hudson%20River%29">New Jersey Palisades</a>, which he donated to the State in an effort to preserve the view from the museum. The Cloisters' new building and gardens were officially opened on May 10, 1938, though the public was not allowed to visit until four days later.

Rockefeller financed the purchase of many of the early collection of works, often buying independently and then donating the items to the museum. His financing of the museum has led to it being described as "perhaps the supreme example of curatorial genius working in exquisite harmony with vast wealth." The second major donor was the industrialist <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>, founder of the <a href="Morgan%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Morgan Library & Museum</a> in New York, who spent the last 20 years of his life acquiring artworks, "on an imperial scale" according to art historian Jean Strous, spending some $900 million (inflation adjusted) in total. After his death, his son <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan%20Jr.">J. P. Morgan Jr.</a> donated a large number of works from the collection to the Metropolitan.

Another major early source of objects was the art dealer <a href="Joseph%20Brummer">Joseph Brummer</a> (1883–1947), long a friend of a curator at the Cloisters, <a href="James%20Rorimer">James Rorimer</a>. Rorimer had long recognized the importance of Brummer's collection, and purchased large quantities of objects in the months after Brummer's sudden death in 1947. According to Christine E. Brennan of the Metropolitan, Rorimer realized that the collection offered works that could rival the Morgan Collection in the Metropolitan's Main Building, and that "the decision to form a treasury at The Cloisters was reached... because it had been the only opportunity since the late 1920s to enrich the collection with so many liturgical and secular objects of such high quality." These pieces, including works in gold, silver and ivory, are today held in the Treasury room of the Cloisters.

The museum's collection of artworks consists of approximately five thousand individual pieces. They are displayed across a series of rooms and spaces, mostly separate from those dedicated to the installed architectural artifacts. The Cloisters has never focused on building a collection of masterpieces, rather the objects are chosen thematically yet arranged simply to enhance the atmosphere created by the architectural elements in the particular setting or room in which they are placed. To create the atmosphere of a functioning series of cloisters, many of the individual works, including capitals, doorways, stained glass and windows are placed within the architectural elements themselves.

The museum's best-known panel painting is <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>'s c. 1425–28 "<a href="M%C3%A9rode%20Altarpiece">Mérode Altarpiece</a>", a foundational work in the development of <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish painting</a>, which has been at The Cloisters since 1956. It acquisition was funded by Rockefeller and described at the time as a "major event for the history of collecting in the United States". The <a href="triptych">triptych</a> is well preserved with little <a href="overpainting">overpainting</a>, glossing, dirt layers or paint loss. Other panel paintings in the collection include a Nativity triptych altarpiece attributed to a follower of <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, and the "Jumieges panels" by an unknown French master.

The 12th-century English walrus ivory <a href="Cloisters%20Cross">Cloisters Cross</a> contains over ninety-two intricately carved figures and ninety-eight inscriptions. A similar 12th-century French metalwork <a href="Reliquary%20Cross%20%28The%20Cloisters%29">reliquary cross</a> contains six sequences of engravings on either side of its shaft, and across the four sides of its lower arms. Further pieces of note include a 13th-century, English "<a href="Enthroned%20Virgin%20and%20Child%20%28English%2C%20The%20Cloisters%29">Enthroned Virgin and Child</a>" statuette, a c. 1490 German <a href="Saint%20Barbara%20%28The%20Cloisters%29">statue of Saint Barbara</a>, and an early 16th-century boxwood <a href="Miniature%20Altarpiece%20with%20the%20Crucifixion">Miniature Altarpiece with the Crucifixion</a>. Other significant works include fountains and baptismal fonts, chairs, <a href="aquamanile">aquamanile</a>s (water containers in animal or human form), bronze lavers, <a href="alms">alms</a> boxes and playing cards.

The museum has an extensive collection of medieval European <a href="frescoes">frescoes</a>, ivory statuettes, reliquary wood and metal shrines and crosses, as well as examples of the very rare <a href="Gothic%20boxwood%20miniature">Gothic boxwood miniature</a>s. It has liturgical metalwork vessels and rare pieces of Gothic furniture and metalwork. Many pieces are not associated with a particular architectural setting, so their placement in the museum may vary. Some of the objects have dramatic provenance, including those plundered from the estates of aristocrats during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>'s occupation of the Southern Netherlands. The Unicorn tapestries were for a period used by the French army to cover potatoes and keep them from freezing. The set was purchased by Rockefeller in 1922 and six of the tapestries hung in his New York home until donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1938.

The museum's collection of <a href="illuminated%20book">illuminated book</a>s is small, but of exceptional quality. J.P. Morgan was a major early donor, but although his taste leaned heavily towards rare printed and illuminated books, he donated very few to the Metropolitan, instead preserving them at the Morgan Library. At the same time, the consensus within the Met was that the Cloisters should focus on architectural elements, sculpture and decorative arts to enhance the environmental quality of the institution, whereas manuscripts were considered more suited to the Morgan Library in lower Manhattan. The Cloisters' books are today displayed in the Treasury room, and include the French "<a href="Cloisters%20Apocalypse">Cloisters Apocalypse</a>" (or "Book of Revelation", c. 1330, probably <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>), <a href="Jean%20Pucelle">Jean Pucelle</a>'s "<a href="Hours%20of%20Jeanne%20d%27Evreux">Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux</a>" (c. 1324–28), the "<a href="Psalter%20of%20Bonne%20de%20Luxembourg">Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg</a>", attributed to <a href="Jean%20Le%20Noir%20%28illuminator%29">Jean Le Noir</a> and the "<a href="Belles%20Heures%20du%20Duc%20de%20Berry">Belles Heures du Duc de Berry</a>" (c. 1399–1416) attributed to the <a href="Limbourg%20brothers">Limbourg brothers</a>. In 2015 the Cloisters acquired a small Netherlandish <a href="Book%20of%20Hours">Book of Hours</a> illuminated by <a href="Simon%20Bening">Simon Bening</a>. Each is of exceptional quality, and their acquisition was a significant achievement for the museum's early collectors.
A coat of arms illustrated on one of the leaves of the "Cloisters Apocalypse" suggests it was commissioned by a member of the de Montigny family of <a href="Coutances">Coutances</a>, Normandy. Stylistically it resembles other Norman illuminated books, as well as some designs on stained glass, of the period. The book was in Switzerland by 1368, possibly at the abbey of <a href="Zofingen">Zofingen</a>, in the <a href="cantons%20of%20Switzerland">canton</a> of <a href="Aargau">Aargau</a>. It was acquired by the Met in 1968.

The "Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux" is a very small early Gothic book of hours containing 209 folios, of which 25 are full page miniatures. It is lavishly decorated in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> drawings, <a href="historiated%20initial">historiated initial</a>s and almost 700 <a href="border%20image">border image</a>s. <a href="Jeanne%20d%27%C3%89vreux">Jeanne d'Évreux</a> was the third wife of <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20France">Charles IV of France</a>, and after their deaths the book went into the possession of Charles' brother, <a href="Jean%2C%20duc%20de%20Berry">Jean, duc de Berry</a>. The use of grisaille (shades of gray) drawings allowed the artist to give the figures a highly sculptural form, and the miniatures contain structures typical of French <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic architecture</a> of the period. The book has been described as "the high point of Parisian court painting", and evidence of "the unprecedentedly refined artistic tastes of the time".

The "Belles Heures" is widely regarded as one of the finest extant examples of manuscript illumination, and very few books of hours are as richly decorated. It is the only surviving complete book attributed to the Limbourg brothers. Rockefeller purchased the book from <a href="Maurice%20de%20Rothschild">Maurice de Rothschild</a> in 1954, and donated it to the Metropolitan.

The very small "Bonne de Luxembourg" manuscript (each leaf 12.5 × 8.4 × 3.9 cm) is attributed to <a href="Jean%20Le%20Noir%20%28illuminator%29">Jean le Noir</a>, and noted for its preoccupation with death. It was commissioned for <a href="Bonne%20of%20Bohemia">Bonne de Luxembourg</a>, <a href="Duchess%20of%20Normandy">Duchess of Normandy</a>, daughter of <a href="John%20the%20Blind">John the Blind</a> and the wife of <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>, probably at the end of her husband's life, c. 1348–49. It was in a private collection for many years, and thus known only through poor-quality photographic reproductions until acquired by the museum in 1969. Produced in <a href="tempera">tempera</a>, grisaille, ink and gold leaf on <a href="vellum">vellum</a>, it had been rarely studied and was until that point misattributed to <a href="Jean%20Pucelle">Jean Pucelle</a>. Following its acquisition, it was studied by art historians, after which attribution was given to Le Noir.

While examples of textile art are displayed throughout the museum, there are two dedicated rooms given to individual series of <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a>, the South Netherlandish "Nine Heroes" (c. 1385) and <a href="Flanders">Flemish</a>"<a href="The%20Hunt%20of%20the%20Unicorn">The Hunt of the Unicorn</a>" (c. 1500). The Nine Heroes room is entered from the Cuxa cloisters. Its 14th-century tapestries are one of the earliest surviving examples of tapestry, and are thought to be the original versions following widely influential and copied designs attributed to Nicolas Bataille. They were acquired over a period of twenty years, involving the purchase of more than 20 individual fragments which were then sewn together during a long reassembly process. The chivalric figures represent the scriptural and legendary <a href="Nine%20Worthies">Nine Worthies</a>, who consist of three pagans (<a href="Hector">Hector</a>, <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>), three Jews (<a href="Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="David">David</a> and <a href="Judas%20Maccabeus">Judas Maccabeus</a>) and three Christians (<a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>, <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and <a href="Godfrey%20of%20Bouillon">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>). Of these, five figures survive: Hector, Caesar, Joshua, David and Arthur. They have been described as representing "in their variety, the highest level of a rich and powerful social structure of later fourteenth-century France".
The "Hunt of the Unicorn" room can be entered from the hall containing the "Nine Heroes" via an early 16th-century door carved with representations of unicorns. The unicorn tapestries consist of a series of large, colourful hangings and fragment textiles designed in Paris and woven in Brussels or Liège. Noted for their vivid colourization -dominated by blue, yellow-brown, red, and gold hues-and the abundance of a wide variety of flora, they were produced for <a href="Anne%20of%20Brittany">Anne of Brittany</a> and completed c. 1495–1505. The tapestries were purchased by Rockefeller in 1922 for about one million dollars, and donated to the museum in 1937. They were cleaned and restored in 1998, and are now hung in a dedicated room on the museum's upper floor.

The large "Nativity" panel (also known as "Christ is Born as Man's Redeemer") from c. 1500, South Netherlandish (probably in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>), "Burgos Tapestry" was acquired by the museum in 1938. It was originally one of a series of eight tapestries representing the salvation of man, with individual scenes influenced by identifiable panel paintings, including by van der Weyden. It was badly damaged in earlier centuries: it had been cut into several irregular pieces and undergone several poor-quality restorations. The panel underwent a long process of restoration from 1971, undertaken by Tina Kane and Alice Blohm of the Metropolitan's Department of Textile Conservation. It is today hung in the Late Gothic hall.

The Cloisters' collection of <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> consists of around three hundred panels, generally French and Germanic and mostly from the 13th to early 16th centuries. A number were formed from handmade <a href="opalescent">opalescent</a> glass. Works in the collection are characterized by vivid colors and often abstract designs and patterns; many have a devotional image as a centerpiece. The majority of these works are in the museum's Boppard room, named after the <a href="Carmelite">Carmelite</a> church of Saint Severinus in <a href="Boppard">Boppard</a>, near <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, Germany. The collection's <a href="pot-metal">pot-metal</a> works (from the High Gothic period) highlight the effects of light, especially the transitions between darkness, shadow and illumination. The Met's collection grew in the early 20th century when Raymond Picairn made acquisitions at a time when medieval glass was not highly regarded by connoisseurs, and was difficult to extract and transport.

Jane Hayward, a curator at the museum from 1969 who began the museum's second phase of acquisition, describes stained glass as "unquestioningly the preeminent form of Gothic medieval monumental painting". She bought c.1500 <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> windows from the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, now in the Campin room with the "Mérode Altarpiece". Hayward's addition in 1980 led to a redesign of the room so that the installed pieces would echo the domestic setting of the altarpiece. She wrote that the Campin room is the only gallery in the Met "where domestic rather than religious art predominates...a conscious effort has been made to create a fifteenth-century domestic interior similar to the one shown in [Campin's] "Annunciation" panel." Other significant acquisitions include late 13th-century <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> panels from the Château-de-Bouvreuil in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, glass work from the <a href="S%C3%A9es%20Cathedral">Cathedral of Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais</a> at <a href="S%C3%A9es">Sées</a>, and panels from the Acezat collection, now in the Heroes Tapestry Hall.

The building is set into a steep hill, and thus the rooms and halls are divided between an upper entrance and a ground-floor level. The enclosing exterior building is mostly modern, and is influenced by and contains elements from the 13th-century church at Saint-Geraud at Monsempron, France, from which the northeast end of the building borrows especially. It was mostly designed by the architect <a href="Allen%20%26amp%3B%20Collens">Charles Collens</a>, who took influence from works in Barnard's collection. Rockefeller closely managed both the building's design and construction, which sometimes frustrated the architects and builders.
The building contains architecture elements and settings taken mostly from four French abbeys, which between 1934 and 1939 were transported, reconstructed, and integrated with new buildings in a project overseen by Collins. He told Rockefeller that the new building "should present a well-studied outline done in the very simplest form of stonework growing naturally out of the rocky hill-top. After looking through the books in the Boston Athenaeum ...we found a building at Monsempron in Southern France of a type which would lend itself in a very satisfactory manner to such a treatment."

The architects sought to both memorialize the north hill's role in the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and to provide a sweeping view over the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>. Construction of the exterior began in 1935. The stonework, primarily of limestone and granite from several European sources, includes four Gothic windows from the refectory at <a href="Sens">Sens</a> and nine arcades. The dome of the Fuentidueña Chapel was especially difficult to fit into the planned area. The east elevation, mostly of limestone, contains nine arcades from the Benedictine priory at <a href="Froville">Froville</a> and four <a href="flamboyant">flamboyant</a> French Gothic windows from the Dominican monastery at Sens.

Located on the south side of the building's main level, the Cuxa cloisters are the museum's centerpiece both structurally and thematically. They were originally erected at the Benedictine Abbey of <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa">Sant Miquel de Cuixà</a> on <a href="Canigou">Mount Canigou</a>, in the northeast French Pyrenees, which was founded in 878. The monastery was abandoned in 1791 and fell into disrepair; its roof collapsed in 1835 and its <a href="bell%20tower">bell tower</a> fell in 1839. About half of its stonework was moved to New York between 1906 and 1907. The installation became one of the first major undertakings by the Metropolitan after it acquired Barnard's collection. After intensive work over the fall and winter of 1925–26, the Cuxa cloisters were opened to the public on April 1, 1926.
The <a href="Quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a>-shaped garden once formed a center around which monks slept in cells. The original garden seemed to have been lined by walkways around <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">adjoining arches</a> lined with capitals enclosing the <a href="Quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">garth</a>. It is impossible now to represent solely medieval species and arrangements; those in the Cuxa garden are approximations by botanists specializing in medieval history. The oldest plan of the original building describes <a href="Lilium">lilies</a> and <a href="rose">rose</a>s. Although the walls are modern, the capitals and columns are original and cut from pink Languedoc marble from the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. The intersection of the two walkways contains an eight-sided fountain.

The capitals were carved at different points in the abbey's history and thus contain a variety of forms and abstract geometric patterns, including scrolling leaves, pine cones, sacred figures such as Christ, the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">Apostles</a>, angels, and monstrous creatures including two-headed animals, lions restrained by apes, <a href="Hybrid%20beasts%20in%20folklore">mythic hybrids</a>, a mermaid and inhuman mouths consuming human torsos. The motifs are derived from popular fables, or represent the brute forces of nature or evil, or are based on late 11th- and 12th-century monastic writings, such as those by <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> (1090–1153). The order in which the capitals were originally placed is unknown, making their interpretation especially difficult, although a sequential and continuous narrative was probably not intended. According to art historian Thomas Dale, to the monks, the "human figures, beasts, and monsters" may have represented the "tension between the world and the cloister, the struggle to repress the natural inclinations of the body".

The Saint-Guilhem cloisters were taken from the site of the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monastery of <a href="Saint-Guilhem-le-D%C3%A9sert">Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert</a>, and date from 804 AD to the 1660s. Their acquisition around 1906 was one of Barnard's early purchases. The transfer to New York involved the movement of around 140 pieces, including capitals, columns and pilasters. The carvings on the marble <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> and column shafts recall Roman sculpture and are coiled by extravagant foliage, including <a href="vine">vine</a>s. The capitals contain <a href="acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> leaves and grotesque heads peering out, including figures at the <a href="Presentation%20at%20the%20Temple">Presentation at the Temple</a>, <a href="Daniel%20in%20the%20Lions%27%20Den">Daniel in the Lions' Den</a> and the <a href="Hellmouth">Mouth of Hell</a>, and several <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and columns. The carvings seem preoccupied with the evils of hell. Those beside the mouth of hell contain representations of the devil and tormenting beasts, with, according to Young, "animal-like body parts and cloven hoofs [as they] herd naked sinners in chains to be thrown into an upturned monster's mouth".

The Guilhem cloisters are inside the museum's upper level and are much smaller than originally built. Its garden contains a central fountain and plants potted in ornate containers, including a 15th-century glazed <a href="earthenware">earthenware</a> vase. The area is covered by a skylight and plate glass panels which conserves heat in the winter months. Rockefeller had initially wanted a high roof and <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> windows, but was convinced by <a href="Joseph%20Breck%20%28curator%29">Joseph Breck</a>, curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan, to install a skylight. Breck wrote to Rockefeller that "by substituting a skylight for a solid ceiling...the sculpture is properly illuminated, since the light falls in a natural way; the visitor has the sense of being in the open; and his attention, consequently, is not attracted to the modern superstructure."

The Bonnefont cloisters were assembled from several French monasteries, but mostly come from a late 12th-century <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> at Bonnefont-en-Comminges, southwest of <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. The abbey was intact until at least 1807, and by the 1850s all of its architectural features had been removed from the site, often for decoration of nearby buildings. Barnard purchased the stonework in 1937. Today the Bonnefont cloisters contain 21 double capitals, and surround a garden that contains many features typical of the medieval period, including a central <a href="wellhead">wellhead</a>, raised flower beds and lined with <a href="Wattle%20%28construction%29">wattle fences</a>. The marbles are highly ornate and decorated, some with <a href="grotesque">grotesque</a> figures. The inner garden has been set with a <a href="Mespilus%20germanica">medlar tree</a> of the type found in "The Hunt of the Unicorn" tapestries, and is centered around a wellhead placed at Bonnefont-en-Comminges in the 12th century. The Bonnefort is on the upper level of the museum and gives a view of the <a href="Hudson%20river">Hudson river</a> and the cliffs of <a href="The%20Palisades%20%28Hudson%20River%29">The Palisades</a>.

The Trie cloisters was compiled from two late 15th- to early 16th-century French structures. Most of its components came from the <a href="Carmelites">Carmelite</a> convent at <a href="Trie-sur-Ba%C3%AFse">Trie-sur-Baïse</a> in south-western France, whose original abbey, except for the church, was destroyed by <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a> in 1571. Small narrow <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es were added in New York during the 1950s by Breck. The rectangular garden hosts around 80 species of plants and contains a tall limestone cascade fountain at its center. Like those from Saint-Guilhem, the Trie cloisters have been given modern roofing.

The convent at Trie-sur-Baïse featured some 80 white marble capitals carved between 1484 and 1490. Eighteen were moved to New York and contain numerous biblical scenes and incidents form the lives of saints. Several of the carvings are secular, including those of legendary figures such as <a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">Saint George and the Dragon</a>, the "<a href="wild%20man">wild man</a>" confronting a grotesque monster, and a grotesque head wearing an unusual and fanciful hat. The capitals are placed in chronological order, beginning with God in the act of creation at the northwest corner, <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> in the west gallery, followed by the <a href="Binding%20of%20Isaac">Binding of Isaac</a>, and <a href="Matthew%20the%20Apostle">Matthew</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a> writing their gospels. Capitals in the south gallery illustrate scenes from the <a href="Life%20of%20Christ%20in%20art">life of Christ</a>.

During periods of political unrest and military invasion, gardens became essential for community survival. The Cloisters' three gardens, the Judy Black Garden at the Cuxa Cloister on the main level, and the Bonnefont and Trie Cloisters gardens on the lower level, were laid out and planted in 1938. They contain a variety of rare medieval species, with a total of over 250 genera of plants, flowers, herbs and trees, making it one of the world's most important collections of specialized gardens. The garden's design was overseen by Rorimer during the museum's construction. He was aided by Margaret Freeman, who conducted extensive research into the keeping of plants and their symbolism in the Middle Ages. Today the gardens are tended by a staff of <a href="horticulturalist">horticulturalist</a>s; the senior members are also historians of 13th- and 14th-century gardening techniques.

The Gothic chapel is set on the museum's ground level, and was built to display its stained glass and large sculpture collections. The entrance from the upper level Early Gothic Hall is lit by stained glass double-<a href="lancet%20window">lancet</a> windows, carved on both sides, and acquired from the church of La Tricherie, France. The ground level is entered through a large door at its east wall. This entrance begins with a pointed Gothic arch leading to high bayed ceilings, ribbed vaults and buttress. The three center windows are from the church of <a href="Bad%20Sankt%20Leonhard%20im%20Lavanttal">Sankt Leonhard</a>, in southern Austria, from c. 1340. The glass panels include a depiction of <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">Martin of Tours</a> as well as complex medallion patterns. The glass on the east wall comes from <a href="Evron%20Abbey">Evron Abbey</a>, Normandy, and dates from around 1325. The <a href="apse">apse</a> contains three large sculptures by the main windows; two larger than life-size female saints dating from the 14th century, and a <a href="Burgundy">Burgundian</a> Bishop dating from the 13th. The large limestone sculpture of <a href="Margaret%20the%20Virgin">Saint Margaret</a> on the wall by the stairs dates to around 1330 and is from the church of in <a href="Lleida">Lleida</a>, Catalonia.
Each of the six effigies are supreme examples of <a href="Funerary%20art">sepulchral art</a>. Three are from the in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. The monument directly facing the main windows is the c. 1248–67 sarcophagus of Jean d'Alluye, a <a href="Knights%20Templar">knight of the crusades</a>, who was thought to have returned from the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> with a relic of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a>. He is shown as a young man, his eyes open, and dressed in <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">chain armor</a>, with his <a href="longsword">longsword</a> and shield. The female effigy of a lady, found in Normandy, dates to the mid 13th century and is perhaps of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Gloucester">Margaret of Gloucester</a>. Although resting on a modern base, she is dressed in high contemporary aristocratic fashion, including a <a href="Mantle%20%28clothing%29">mantle</a>, <a href="cotte">cotte</a>, jewel studded belt and an elaborate ring necklace <a href="brooch">brooch</a>.

Four of the effigies were made for the Urgell family, are set into the chapel walls, and are associated with the church of Santa Maria at Castello de Farfanya, redesigned in the Gothic style for <a href="Ermengol%20X%2C%20Count%20of%20Urgell">Ermengol X</a> (died c. 1314). The elaborate sarcophagus of <a href="Ermengol%20VII%2C%20Count%20of%20Urgell">Ermengol VII, Count of Urgell</a> (d. 1184) is placed on the left hand wall facing the chapel's south windows. It is supported by three stone lions, and a grouping of mourners carved into the <a href="Stone%20slab">slab</a>, which also shows <a href="Christ%20in%20Majesty">Christ in Majesty</a> flanked by the <a href="Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>. The three other Urgell tombs also date to the mid 13th century, and maybe of <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20of%20Urgell">Àlvar of Urgell</a> and his second wife, Cecilia of Foix, the parents of Ermengol X, and that of a young boy, possibly <a href="Ermengol%20IX%2C%20Count%20of%20Urgell">Ermengol IX</a>, the only one of their direct line ancestors known to have died in youth. The slabs of the double tomb on the wall opposite Ermengol VII, contain the effigies of his parents, and have been slanted forward to offer a clear view of the stonework. The heads are placed on cushions, which are decorated with arms. The male's feet rest on a dog, while the cushion under the woman's head is held by an angel.

The Fuentidueña chapel is the museum's largest room, and is entered through a broad oak door flanked by sculptures which include leaping animals. Its centerpiece is the <a href="The%20Fuentidue%C3%B1a%20Apse">Fuentidueña Apse</a>, a semicircular Romanesque recess built between about 1175 to 1200 at the Saint Joan church at <a href="Fuentidue%C3%B1a">Fuentidueña</a>, <a href="Segovia">Segovia</a>. By the 19th century, the church was long abandoned and in disrepair. 

It was acquired by Rockefeller for the Cloisters in 1931, following three decades of complex negotiation and diplomacy between the Spanish church and both countries' art-historical hierarchies and governments. It was eventually exchanged in a deal that involved the transfer of six <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es from <a href="San%20Baudelio%20de%20Berlanga">San Baudelio de Berlanga</a> to the Prado, on an equally long-term loan. The structure was disassembled into almost 3,300 mostly sandstone and limestone blocks, each individually cataloged, and shipped to New York in 839 crates. 

It was rebuilt at the Cloisters in the late 1940s It was such a large and complex reconstruction that it required the demolition of the former "Special Exhibition Room". The chapel was opened to the public in 1961, seven years after its installation had begun.
The apse consists of a broad arch leading to a <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a>, and culminates with a half-dome. The capitals at the entrance contain representations of the <a href="Adoration%20of%20the%20Magi">Adoration of the Magi</a> and <a href="Daniel%20in%20the%20lions%27%20den">Daniel in the lions' den</a>. The piers show Martin of Tours on the left and the angel <a href="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> announcing to <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">The Virgin</a> on the right. The chapel includes other, mostly contemporary, medieval artwork. They include, in the dome, a large fresco dating to between 1130–50, from the Spanish Church of Sant Joan de Tredòs. The fresco's colorization resembles a <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> and is dedicated to the ideal of Mary as the mother of God. Hanging within the apse is a crucifix made between about 1150 to 1200 for the in <a href="Astudillo%2C%20Palencia">Astudillo</a>, Spain. Its reverse contains a depiction of the Agnus Dei (<a href="Lamb%20of%20God">Lamb of God</a>), decorated with red and blue foliage at its frames. The exterior wall holds three small, narrow and stilted windows, which are nevertheless designed to let in the maximum amount of light. The windows were originally set within imposing fortress walls; according to the art historian Bonnie Young "these small windows and the massive, fortress-like walls contribute to the feeling of austerity...typical of Romanesque churches."

The Langon chapel is on the museum's ground level. Its right wall was built around 1126 for the Romanesque <a href="Cath%C3%A9drale%20Notre-Dame-du-Bourg%20de%20Digne">Cathédrale Notre-Dame-du-Bourg de Digne</a>. The chapter house consists of a single <a href="aisle">aisle</a> <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="transept">transept</a>s taken from a small <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> parish church built around 1115 at Notre Dame de Pontaut. When acquired, it was in disrepair, its upper level in use as a storage place for tobacco. About three-quarters of its original stonework was moved to New York. 

The chapel is entered from the Romanesque hall through <a href="Doorway%20from%20Moutiers-Saint-Jean">a doorway</a>, a large, elaborate French Gothic stone entrance commissioned by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian court</a> for <a href="Moutiers-Saint-Jean%20Abbey">Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey</a> in Burgundy, France. Moutiers-Saint-Jean was sacked, burned, and rebuilt several times. In 1567, the <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> army removed the heads from the two kings, and in 1797 the abbey was sold as rubble for rebuilding. The site lay in ruin for decades and lost further sculptural elements until Barnard arranged for the entrances' transfer to New York. The doorway had been the main portal of the abbey, and was probably built as the south transept door. 

Carvings on the elaborate white <a href="Oolite">oolitic</a> limestone doorway depict the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20Virgin">Coronation of the Virgin</a> and contains foliated capitals and statuettes on the outer piers; including two kings positioned in the <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s and various kneeling angels. Carvings of angels are placed in the <a href="archivolt">archivolt</a>s above the kings. The large figurative sculptures on either side of the doorway represent the early <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> kings <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a> (d. 511) and his son <a href="Chlothar%20I">Chlothar I</a> (d. 561). The <a href="pier">pier</a>s are lined with elaborate and highly detailed rows of statuettes, which are mostly set in <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niche</a>s, and are badly damaged; most have been decapitated. The heads on the right hand capital were for a time believed to represent <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a>. Seven capitals survive from the original church, with carvings of human figures or heads, some of which as have been identified as historical persons, including <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>.

The Romanesque hall contains three large church doorways, with the main visitor entrance adjoining the Guilhem Cloister. The monumental arched <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian</a> doorway is from <a href="Moutiers-Saint-Jean%20Abbey">Moutier-Saint-Jean de Réôme</a> in France and dates to c. 1150. Two animals are carved into the <a href="Keystone%20%28architecture%29">keystones</a>; both rest on their hind legs as if about to attack each other. The capitals are lined with carvings of both real and imagined animals and birds, as well as leaves and other fauna. The two earlier doorways are from <a href="Laf%C3%A9line">Reugny, Allier</a>, and <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> in central France. The hall contains four large early-13th-century stone sculptures representing the Adoration of the Magi, frescoes of a lion and a <a href="wyvern">wyvern</a>, each from the <a href="Monastery%20of%20San%20Pedro%20de%20Arlanza">Monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza</a> in north central Spain. On the left of the room are portraits of kings and angels, also from the monastery at Moutier-Saint-Jean. The hall contains three pairs of columns positioned over an entrance with molded archivolts. They were taken from the Augustinian church at <a href="Reugny%2C%20Indre-et-Loire">Reugny</a>. The Reugny site was badly damaged during the French Wars of Religion and again during the French Revolution. Most of the structures had been sold to a local man, Piere-Yon Verniere, by 1850, and were acquired by Barnard in 1906.

The Treasury room was opened in 1988 to celebrate the museum's 50th anniversary. It largely consists of small luxury objects acquired by the Met after it had built its initial collection, and draws heavily on acquisitions from the collection of Joseph Brummer. The rooms contains the museum's collection of illuminated manuscripts, the French 13th-century arm-shaped silver reliquary, and a 15th-century deck of <a href="playing%20cards">playing cards</a>.

The Cloisters contains one of the Metropolitan's 13 libraries. Focusing on medieval art and architecture, it holds over 15,000 volumes of books and journals, the museum's archive administration papers, curatorial papers, dealer records and the personal papers of Barnard, as well as early glass lantern slides of museum materials, manuscript <a href="facsimile">facsimile</a>s, scholarly records, maps and recordings of musical performances at the museum. The library functions primarily as a resource for museum staff, but is available by appointment to researchers, art dealers, academics and students. The archives contain early sketches and <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a>s made during the early design phase of the museum's construction, as well as historical photographic collections. These include photographs of medieval objects from the collection of <a href="George%20Joseph%20Demotte">George Joseph Demotte</a>, and a series taken during and just after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> showing damage sustained to monuments and artifacts, including tomb effigies. They are, according to curator Lauren Jackson-Beck, of "prime importance to the art historian who is concerned with the identification of both the original work and later areas of reconstruction". Two important series of prints are kept on <a href="microfilm">microfilm</a>: the "Index photographique de l'art en France" and the German "<a href="Marburg%20Picture%20Index">Marburg Picture Index</a>".

The Cloisters is governed by the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Metropolitan's collections are owned by a private corporation of about 950 fellows and benefactors. The board of trustees comprise 41 elected members, several officials of the City of New York, and persons honored as trustees by the museum. The current chairman of the board is the businessman and art collector <a href="Daniel%20Brodsky">Daniel Brodsky</a>, who was elected in 2011, having previously served on its Real Estate Council in 1984 as a trustee of the museum and Vice Chairman of the Buildings Committee.

A specialist museum, the Cloisters regularly acquires new works and rarely <a href="Deaccessioning%20%28museum%29">sells or otherwise gets rid of them</a>. While the Metropolitan does not publish separate figures for the Cloisters, the entity as a whole spent $39 million on acquisitions for the fiscal year ending in June 2012. The Cloisters seeks to balance its collection between religious and secular artifacts and artworks. With secular pieces, it typically favors those that indicate the range of artistic production in the medieval period, and according to art historian Timothy Husband, "reflect the fabric of daily [medieval European] life but also endure as works of art in their own right." In 2011 it purchased the then-recently discovered "The Falcon's Bath", a Southern Netherlands <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> dated c. 1400–1415. It is of exceptional quality, and one of the best preserved surviving examples of its type. Other recent acquisitions of significance include the 2015 purchase of a Book of Hours attributed to <a href="Simon%20Bening">Simon Bening</a>.

The museum's architectural settings, atmosphere and acoustics have made it a regular setting both for musical recitals and as a stage for medieval theater. Notable stagings include "<a href="Le%20Miracle%20de%20Th%C3%A9ophile">The Miracle of Theophilus</a>" in 1942, and John Gassner's adaption of "<a href="The%20Second%20Shepherds%27%20Play">The Second Shepherds' Play</a>" in 1954. Recent significant exhibitions include "Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures" which ran in the summer of 2017 in conjunction with the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> and <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, Amsterdam.

The museum is a well-known New York City landmark and has been used as a filming location. In 1948, director <a href="Maya%20Deren">Maya Deren</a> used its ramparts as a backdrop for her experimental film "Meditation on Violence". That year, German director <a href="William%20Dieterle">William Dieterle</a> used the Cloisters as the location for a convent school in his film "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Jennie">Portrait of Jennie</a>". The 1968 film "<a href="Coogan%27s%20Bluff%20%28film%29">Coogan's Bluff</a>" used the site's pathways and lanes for a scenic motorcycle chase.

HMS Queen Mary

HMS "Queen Mary" was the last <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> built by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The sole member of her <a href="ship%20class">class</a>, "Queen Mary" shared many features with the s, including her eight guns. She was completed in 1913 and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight%20%281914%29">Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> as part of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> in 1914. Like most of the modern British battlecruisers, she never left the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> during the war. As part of the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>, she attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914, but was unsuccessful. She was refitting in early 1915 and missed the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> in January, but participated in the largest fleet action of the war, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in mid-1916. She was hit twice by the German battlecruiser during the early part of the battle and her <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s exploded shortly afterwards, sinking the ship.

Her wreck was discovered in 1991 and rests in pieces, some of which are upside down, on the floor of the North Sea. "Queen Mary" is designated as a protected place under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Military%20Remains%20Act%201986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</a> as it is the grave of 1,266 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.

"Queen Mary" was ordered, together with the four <a href="battleships">battleships</a> of the , under the 1910–11 Naval Programme. As was the usual pattern of the time, only one battlecruiser was ordered per naval programme. She differed from her predecessors of the "Lion" class in the distribution of her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> and armour and in the location of the officers' quarters. Every <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> since the design of the battleship in 1905 had placed the officers' quarters closer to their action stations amidships; after complaints from the Fleet, "Queen Mary" was the first battlecruiser to restore the quarters to their traditional place in the stern. In addition, she was the first battlecruiser to mount a <a href="sternwalk">sternwalk</a>.

"Queen Mary", the only ship of her name ever to serve in the Royal Navy, was named for <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary of Teck</a>, the wife of King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>. The Queen's representative at the ship's <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">christening</a> on 20 March 1912 was the wife of <a href="Wentworth%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allendale">Viscount Allendale</a>.

Slightly larger than the preceding "Lion"-class ships, "Queen Mary" had an overall length of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Full%20or%20deep%20load%20or%20loaded%20displacement">deep load</a>. The ship normally displaced and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. She had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load. In peacetime the crew numbered 997 officers and ratings, but this increased to 1,275 during wartime.

The ship had two paired sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="Direct%20drive%20mechanism">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s housed in separate <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>s. Each set consisted of a high-pressure turbine driving an outboard propeller shaft and a low-pressure turbine driving an inner shaft. A cruising <a href="Steam%20turbine%23Steam%20supply%20and%20exhaust%20conditions">stage</a> was built into the casing of each high-pressure turbine for economical steaming at low speeds. The turbines had a designed output of , more than her predecessors. On <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in May and June 1913, "Queen Mary" achieved more than , although she barely exceeded her designed speed of . The steam plant consisted of 42 <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s arranged in seven <a href="Fire%20room">boiler rooms</a>. Maximum bunkerage was of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. Her range was at a speed of .

"Queen Mary" mounted eight <a href="BL%2013.5%20inch%20/45%20naval%20gun">BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns</a> in four twin <a href="Hydraulic%20machinery">hydraulically powered</a> turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'X' from bow to stern. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 20°, although the director controlling the turrets was limited to 15° 21' until <a href="prism%20%28optics%29">prism</a>s were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 20° elevation, this provided a maximum range of with <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing (AP)</a> shells. The <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> of these guns was 1.5–2 rounds per minute. "Queen Mary" carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch Mk VII guns</a>, most of which were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> deck, unlike the arrangement in the "Lion" class. The guns could depress to −7° and had a maximum elevation of 15°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a maximum range of ; the ship carried 150 rounds per gun.

The ship was built without any <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns, but two guns were fitted in October 1914. One was a <a href="QF%206-pounder%20Hotchkiss">QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss</a> gun and the other was a <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch 20 cwt</a>, both on high-angle mountings. The Hotchkiss fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The three-inch gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of with a maximum effective ceiling of .

Two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were fitted, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Fourteen <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo%2321%20inch%20Mark%20II">Mk II***</a> torpedoes were carried, each of which had a warhead of of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>. Their range was at or at .

In February 1913, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> bought five sets of fire-control equipment from <a href="Arthur%20Pollen">Arthur Pollen</a> for comparative trials with the equipment designed by <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commander</a> <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer">Frederic Dreyer</a>. One set was mounted in "Queen Mary" and consisted of a Argo <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> located on top of the conning tower that fed range data into an <a href="Argo%20Clock%20Mk%20IV">Argo Clock Mk IV</a> (a mechanical <a href="Fire-control%20system">fire-control computer</a>) located in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23T">transmitting station</a> below the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>. The clock converted the information into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The aft torpedo director tower was the backup gunnery control position. All four turrets were provided with 9-foot rangefinders and 'B' and 'X' turrets were further outfitted to serve as auxiliary control positions.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I, and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. "Queen Mary" received her director before the Battle of Jutland.

The armour protection given to "Queen Mary" was similar to that of the "Lion"s; her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> was also thick between 'B' and 'X' turrets. It thinned to inches towards the ships' ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. In addition the ship was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour, thinning to abreast the end turrets. Four-inch transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s closed off the ends of the armoured citadel. High-tensile steel plating, cheaper than nickel-steel, but equally as effective, was used for the protective decks. The lower armoured deck was generally only thick except outside the citadel where it was . The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only one inch thick. The forecastle deck ranged from .

The gun turrets had nine-inch fronts and sides, while their roofs were thick. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were protected by nine inches of armour above the deck, but it thinned to above the upper armour deck and below it. The forward 4-inch guns were protected by three-inch sides and a two-inch high-tensile steel deck overhead. The conning tower sides were thick, with three-inch roofs and communication tubes. Her aft torpedo director tower was protected by six-inch walls and a three-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. Her <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> uptakes were protected by high-tensile steel splinter armour thick on the sides and one inch thick on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks.

"Queen Mary" was laid down at <a href="Palmers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Iron%20Company">Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company</a>, <a href="Jarrow">Jarrow</a>, on 6 March 1911. She was launched on 20 March 1912 and was completed in August 1913 at a total cost of £2,078,491 (including guns). The ship came under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Reginald%20Hall">Reginald Hall</a> on 1 July and was the last battlecruiser commissioned before the start of World War I, being commissioned on 4 September 1913. Assigned to the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (BCS) under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>, "Queen Mary" and the rest of the 1st BCS made a port visit to <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June.

"Queen Mary"s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule, and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Jade Estuary</a>. The brand-new <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. "Strassburg" was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but "Cöln" remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty, however, was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly ahead of him. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range (under 6000 yards or 5.5 km). At 13:10 Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Beatty's main body encountered the crippled "Cöln" shortly after turning north, and she was sunk by two salvos from .

The <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it <a href="defeat%20in%20detail">in detail</a>. An earlier <a href="Raid%20on%20Yarmouth">Raid on Yarmouth</a> on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a> afterwards. The fast battle-cruisers were to conduct the bombardment, while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including "Lion", together with the 2nd Battle Squadron with six <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s, was detached from the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> in an attempt to intercept the Germans near <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a>. By this time, "Queen Mary" was commanded by Captain C. I. Prowse.

Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="George%20Warrender%2C%207th%20Baronet">Sir George Warrender</a>, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 5:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 07:25. Warrender received the signal, as did the battlecruiser , but Beatty did not, despite the fact that "New Zealand" had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on "Shark"s message to Beatty at 7:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched "New Zealand" to search for "Roon". She was being overhauled by "New Zealand" when Beatty received messages that <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered "New Zealand" to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships passed to the north, while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however, those were some 50 km (31 mi) behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

"Queen Mary" was refitting in January and February 1915 and did not participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>; she received her main battery director in December 1915.

On 31 May 1916 "Queen Mary" put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, almost 180 degrees, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east, as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn, as only the two leading ships, "Lion" and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range, as the German ships blended into the haze. "Queen Mary" opened fire about 15:50 on , using only her forward turrets. By 15:54 the range was down to , and Beatty ordered a course change two <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">points</a> to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. During this period, "Queen Mary" made two hits on "Seydlitz", at 15:55 and 15:57, one of which caused a <a href="propellant">propellant</a> fire that burnt out her aft <a href="Superfire">superfiring</a> turret.
The range had grown too far for accurate shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed "Lion" to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused to lose sight of "Lion", which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to "Queen Mary", now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be "Princess Royal", at 16:16. "Queen Mary" hit "Seydlitz" again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, "Queen Mary" had been hit twice by "Seydlitz" before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for "Queen Mary", as "Derfflinger"s fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated one or both of the forward <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s, which broke the ship in two near the <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, <a href="Midshipman">Midshipman</a> <a href="Jocelyn%20Latham%20Storey">Jocelyn Latham Storey</a> survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.

"Queen Mary", along with the other Jutland wrecks, has been declared a "protected place" under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist <a href="Innes%20McCartney">Innes McCartney</a> in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.

Trafford

Trafford is a <a href="metropolitan%20borough">metropolitan borough</a> of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England, with an estimated population of 235,493 in 2017. It covers and includes the areas of <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>, <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a>, <a href="Altrincham">Altrincham</a>, <a href="Partington">Partington</a> and <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a>. The borough was formed in 1974 as a merger of the <a href="metropolitan%20borough">metropolitan borough</a>s of Altrincham, <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Sale">Sale</a>, and <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Stretford">Stretford</a>, the <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a>s of <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a>, <a href="Hale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hale</a> and <a href="Urmston%20Urban%20District">Urmston</a> and part of <a href="Bucklow%20Rural%20District">Bucklow Rural District</a>. The <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> flows through the borough, separating North Trafford from South Trafford, and the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic counties</a> of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>.

There is evidence of <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, and <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> activity in the area, two castles – one of them a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> – and over 200 <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>s. In the late 19th century, the population rapidly expanded with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of <a href="Altrincham%20F.C.">Altrincham Football Club</a>, <a href="Trafford%20F.C.">Trafford Football Club</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a>, <a href="The%20Trafford%20Centre">The Trafford Centre</a> and <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire County Cricket Club</a> and since 2002 the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum%20North">Imperial War Museum North</a>.

Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains both <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> industrial estate and the <a href="Trafford%20Centre">Trafford Centre</a>, a large out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the <a href="City%20of%20Manchester">City of Manchester</a>, Trafford is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income. Socially, the area includes both <a href="working%20class">working class</a> and <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> areas like <a href="Bowdon%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bowdon</a> and <a href="Hale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hale</a>. In <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>, Trafford is represented by three <a href="United%20Kingdom%20constituencies">constituencies</a>: <a href="Stretford%20and%20Urmston%20%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29">Stretford and Urmston</a>; <a href="Altrincham%20and%20Sale%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Altrincham and Sale West</a>; and <a href="Wythenshawe%20and%20Sale%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wythenshawe and Sale East</a>, which mainly covers neighbouring Manchester.

The choice of the name Trafford for the borough was a "compromise between Altrincham, Stretford and Sale", and "seemed to have wide support". A Liberal councillor for the <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Sale">Municipal Borough of Sale</a> suggested "Crossford ... whilst "Watlingford" was suggested by councillors in Hale, after the supposed name of an ancient <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> in the district. Those names were rejected in favour of Trafford, because of the district's "famous sports venue, a major employer as well as historic associations", referring to <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> (<a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">cricket</a> and <a href="Old%20Trafford">football</a>), <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> and the <a href="de%20Trafford%20baronets">de Trafford baronets</a> respectively.

As a place name, Trafford is an <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-French</a> version of Stratford, deriving from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> words "stræt" (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and "ford" (a river crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers has a long history. <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> arrowheads have been discovered in <a href="Altrincham">Altrincham</a> and <a href="Sale%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Sale</a>, and there is evidence of <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> habitation in <a href="Timperley">Timperley</a>. Fragments of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> pottery have been found in <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a>, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the <a href="legionary">legionary</a> <a href="castra">fortresses</a> at <a href="Chester">Chester</a> (<a href="Deva%20Victrix">Deva Victrix</a>) and <a href="York">York</a> (<a href="Eboracum">Eboracum</a>) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was founded as a market town in the mid 13th century. Although the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the <a href="Manchester%2C%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a>, which allowed residents to commute more easily from Trafford into Manchester. The area developed its own centres of industry in <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Broadheath</a> (founded in 1885) and <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> (founded in 1897). They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40–50,000 people. Today, Trafford is mostly a commuter area. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a> as one of the ten metropolitan districts of Greater Manchester.

The metropolitan boroughs of the <a href="City%20of%20Salford">City of Salford</a> and the <a href="City%20of%20Manchester">City of Manchester</a> border Trafford to the north and east respectively; the <a href="Cheshire%20East">Cheshire East</a> area of <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> lies to the south. The geology of South Trafford is <a href="Keuper%20marl">Keuper marl</a> with some Keuper waterstone and sandstone, whilst the geology of North Trafford is <a href="Bunter%20%28geology%29">Bunter sandstone</a>. The <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> runs east to west through the area, separating North Trafford from South Trafford; other rivers in Trafford include the <a href="River%20Bollin">Bollin</a>, the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a>, Sinderland Brook, and Crofts Bank Brook. The <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>, opened in 1761 and completed in 1776, follows a course through Trafford roughly north to south and passes through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, opened in 1894, forms part of Trafford's northern and western boundaries with <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>.

Trafford is generally flat, with most of the land lying between and above sea level, apart from Bowdon Hill in South Trafford which rises above sea level. The lowest point in Trafford, near <a href="Warburton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Warburton</a>, is above sea level. There are areas of <a href="bog">mossland</a> in low-lying areas: Warburton Moss, Dunham Moss, and Hale Moss. <a href="Green%20belt">Greenspace</a> accounts for 51.8% of Trafford's total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 25.6%, the rest is made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.

Trafford is part of the <a href="North%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North West England</a> constituency in the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>. North West England is represented by eight MEPs; at the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202014%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2014 European elections</a>, the region elected two Conservatives, three from the Labour Party, and three members of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party">United Kingdom Independence Party</a>.

In 1974, Trafford Council was created to administer the newly formed Trafford Metropolitan Borough and is headquartered at <a href="Trafford%20Town%20Hall">Trafford Town Hall</a>, which was previously named Stretford Town Hall. On its formation in 1974, the council was controlled by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>; the Conservatives have been in control 1973–85, 1988–94, and 2004 to the present. The only time the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> was in control was 1996–2002. The rest of the time were periods of no overall control. The council meets to decide policy and allocate budget. Its duties include setting levels of <a href="council%20tax">council tax</a>, monitoring the health service in Trafford, providing social care, and funding schools. Cllr Andrew Western is the leader of the council as of 2018, and Cllr Tom Ross is the current mayor.

In 2007 the <a href="Audit%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Audit Commission</a> judged Trafford Council to be "improving strongly" in providing services for local people. Overall the council was awarded "three star" status meaning it was "performing well" and "consistently above minimum requirements", similar to 46% of all local authorities. In 2008–09, Trafford council had a budget of £150.5 million. This was collected from <a href="council%20tax">council tax</a> (57%) and government grants (43%). The council spent £31.8 million on children and young people's services (21%); £60.1 million on community services and social care (40%); £34.4 million on "prosperity, planning, and development" (23%); and £33.8 million on customer and corporate services (22%).

<a href="Civil%20parish">Civil parish</a>es form the bottom tier of local government; the parish councils are involved in planning, management of town and parish centres, and promoting tourism. In 2001, 8,484 people (4.0% of the borough's population) lived in Trafford's four civil parishes: Carrington, Dunham Massey, Partington, and Warburton. They were all previously part of <a href="Bucklow%20Rural%20District">Bucklow Rural District</a>. A rural district was a type of local government district for the administration of predominantly rural areas. The rest of Trafford is <a href="unparished%20area">unparished</a>. The unparished areas are: Altrincham (<a href="Municipal%20Borough">Municipal Borough</a>), Bowdon (<a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Urban District</a>), Hale (Urban District), Sale (Municipal Borough), Stretford (Municipal Borough), and Urmston (Urban District). The status of each area prior to 1974 is shown in brackets. An urban district was a type of local government district which covered an urbanised area.

Following the 2018 local elections, the council, which was previously Conservative-held, came under Labour control in the form of a minority administration. There were a few shock results, such as in <a href="Altrincham%20%28ward%29">Altrincham (ward)</a>, where the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party</a> gained seats from the incumbent Conservative councillors.

There are 21 electoral wards in Trafford, each with 3 councillors, giving a total of 63 councillors with one-third elected three years out of four. In the following table, the populations for each ward are based on 2013 population estimates from the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>.

The coat of arms of Trafford Council depicts a <a href="griffin">griffin</a> on a shield flanked by two <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a>s. The line bisecting the shield horizontally symbolises the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> running through Trafford from east to west and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.

At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 UK census</a>, the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford had a total population of 210,145.
Of the 89,313 households in the borough, 36.5% were married couples living together, 31.6% were one-person households, 7.8% were <a href="cohabitation">co-habiting</a> couples and 9.7% were lone parents, following a similar trend to the rest of England.

The population density was and for every 100 females, there were 94.6 males. Of those aged 16–74 in Trafford, 24.7% had no <a href="Education%20in%20England%23Specialist%20qualifications">academic qualifications</a>, significantly lower than the 28.9% in all of England. 8.2% of Trafford's residents were born outside the United Kingdom, lower than the English average of 9.2%. The largest minority group was Asian, at 4.0% of the population.

In 1841, 12% of Trafford's population was <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> compared to 14% in England and Wales; this increased to 21% in 1931 (15% nationally) and 55% in 2001 (48% nationally). From 1841 to 1951, the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> population of Trafford and across the country was in decline, falling steadily from 43% to 18% (36% to 29% nationally). It has since increased slightly, up to 27% (26% nationwide). The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. In the 2008/2009 financial year, the crime rates in Trafford for violence against a person and sexual offences were below the national averages. However, the rate of robberies and burglaries were above the national average.

The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a>es that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and was a result of the construction of the <a href="Manchester%2C%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a> in 1849. The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census mirrors the trend for <a href="Demography%20of%20Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a> but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.

Historically, the economy of the Trafford dominated by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent as it did in the rest of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in <a href="Tameside">Tameside</a> and 51 in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, and <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the <a href="Earl%20of%20Stamford">Stamfords</a> and the <a href="De%20Trafford%20baronets">de Traffords</a>.

<a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> was founded in 1897, and at its peak in 1945 employed 75,000 people. As well as being the world's first planned <a href="industrial%20estate">industrial estate</a>, it is Europe's largest business park. More than 1,400 companies are within the park, employing between 40,000 and 50,000 people. The <a href="Trafford%20Centre">Trafford Centre</a>, which opened on 10 September 1998, is <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>'s largest indoor shopping complex. The centre has over 30 million visitors annually, and contains 235 stores, 55 restaurants, and the largest <a href="Odeon%20Cinemas">Odeon</a> cinema in the UK.
Trafford is a prosperous area, with an average weekly income of £394, and apart from Manchester it is the only borough in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> to be above the national average for weekly income and is on average the highest in the county. Media, advertising and public relations have been identified as growth industries in Greater Manchester and are concentrated in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and Trafford. Average house prices in Trafford are the highest out of all the metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester, 45% higher than the average for the county.

At the 2001 UK census, Trafford had 151,445 residents aged 16 to 74. 2.5% of these people were students with jobs, 5.7% looking after home or family, 5.4% permanently sick or disabled and 2.8% economically inactive for other reasons. Trafford has a low rate of unemployment (2.7%) compared with Greater Manchester (3.6%) and England as a whole (3.3%). Trafford has the lowest number of unemployment benefit claimants compared to all the other boroughs in Greater Manchester (3.7%).

In 2001, of 99,146 residents of Trafford in employment, the industry of employment was 17.1% property and business services, 16.5% retail and wholesale, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.9% health and social work, 8.2% education, 8.0% transport and communications, 5.9% construction, 5.5% finance, 4.5% public administration and defence, 4.0% hotels and restaurants, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.6% agriculture, and 4.6% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is less than half the national average, reflecting Trafford's suburban nature and its proximity to the centre of Manchester.

A study commissioned by <a href="Experian">Experian</a> rated Trafford as the strongest and most resilient borough in <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a> to dealing with sudden changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.

The largest known right whales can attain in length and weigh up to or with uncertainty, Their immense bulk makes right whale significantly heavier than other whales of similar or greater length such as the <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback</a>, <a href="gray%20whale">gray</a>, <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm</a> and even <a href="fin%20whale">fin</a> whales. In fact, right whales rank only behind the <a href="blue%20whale">blue whale</a> in sheer body mass. One (apocryphal) explanation for their name is that whalers identified them as the "right" whale to kill on a hunt due to the plentiful oil and <a href="baleen">baleen</a> they could provide.

All three species are <a href="Animal%20migration">migratory</a>, moving seasonally to feed or give birth. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that isolates the northern and southern species from one another although the southern species, at least, has been known to cross the <a href="equator">equator</a>. In the Northern Hemisphere, right whales tend to avoid open waters and stay close to <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s and bays and on <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelves</a>, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods. In the Southern Hemisphere, right whales feed far offshore in summer, but a large portion of the population occur in near-shore waters in winter. Right whales feed mainly on <a href="copepods">copepods</a> but also consume <a href="krill">krill</a> and <a href="pteropod">pteropod</a>s. They may forage the surface, underwater or even the ocean bottom. During courtship, males gather into large groups to compete for a single female, suggesting that <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a> is an important factor in mating behavior. Although the blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, the <a href="testes">testes</a> of the right whale are actually ten times larger than those of the blue whale – with each weighing up to , they are by far the largest of any animal on Earth. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> tends to last a year, and calves are born at in weight and in length. Weaning occurs after eight months.

Right whales were a preferred target for <a href="whaling">whalers</a> because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendency to stay close to the coast, and their high <a href="blubber">blubber</a> content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of <a href="whale%20oil">whale oil</a>). Today, the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic</a> and <a href="North%20Pacific%20Ocean">North Pacific</a> right whales are among the most endangered whales in the world, and both species are protected in the United States by the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. The "western" populations of both are currently <a href="endangered">endangered</a>, with their total populations numbering in the hundreds. The "eastern" North Pacific population, on the other hand, with fewer than 50 individuals remaining, is <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> – further still, the eastern North Atlantic population, which numbers in the low teens at best, may already be functionally <a href="extinction">extinct</a>.

Although the whales no longer face a threat from whaling, mankind remains by far the greatest threat to these species: the two leading causes of death are being struck by ships and entanglement in fishing gear. For the North Atlantic right whale, for example, whose population was estimated at 411 in 2018 which was down from 451 in 2016 and 458 in 2015, these two <a href="Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> factors alone account for 48% of all known right whale deaths since 1970. More than 85% of right whales have been entangled at least once.

In 2017, at least 118 right whales were in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20St%20Lawrence">Gulf of St Lawrence</a>, or roughly a quarter of the local population, which previously fed in summer and fall months in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> and Roadway basin. The habitat shift moved this population away from existing conservation efforts and into the path of busy shipping lanes and also snow crab fisheries where <a href="Fisheries%20and%20Oceans%20Canada">Fisheries and Oceans Canada</a> doubled the quotas in 2017.

A popular explanation for the name "right whales" is that they were the ones to hunt, as they float when killed and often swim within sight of shore. They are quite docile and do not tend to shy away from approaching boats. As such, they were hunted nearly to extinction during the active years of the whaling industry. This origin is apocryphal. In his history of American whaling, Eric Jay Dolin writes:
The right whales were first classified in the genus "Balaena" in 1758 by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who at the time considered all of the right whales (including the bowhead) as a single species. Through the 1800s and 1900s, in fact, the family Balaenidae has been the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, "Balaena mysticetus". Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were in fact different, and <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> proposed the genus "Eubalaena" for the right whale in 1864. Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale—one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>. As recently as 1998, Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, "Marine mammals of the world: systematics and distribution", listed just two species: "Balaena glacialis" (the right whales) and "Balaena mysticetus" (the bowheads).
In 2000, two studies of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> samples from each of the whale populations concluded the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3 million and 12 million years.

In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the conservation status of the North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the <a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the "Eubalaena" nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude that the three different living right whale species constitute a distinct <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> lineage from the <a href="bowhead%20whale">bowhead</a>, and properly belong to a separate genus.

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between <a href="taxa">taxa</a>; the point where each node branches is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the three right whales and the bowhead whale.

<a href="Whale%20louse">Whale lice</a>, <a href="Parasitism">parasitic</a> <a href="cyamid">cyamid</a> <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s that live off skin debris, offer further information through their own genetics. Because these lice reproduce much more quickly than whales, their genetic diversity is greater. Marine biologists at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> examined these louse genes and determined their hosts split into three species 5–6 thousand years ago, and these species were all equally abundant before <a href="whaling">whaling</a> began in the 11th century. The communities first split because of the joining of <a href="North%20America">North</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. The rising temperatures of the equator then created a second split, into northern and southern groups, preventing them from interbreeding. "This puts an end to the long debate about whether there are three ["Eubalaena"] species of right whale. They really are separate beyond a doubt", Jon Seger, the project's leader, told BBC News.

The <a href="pygmy%20right%20whale">pygmy right whale</a> ("Caperea marginata"), a much smaller whale of the Southern Hemisphere, was until recently considered a member of the Family Balaenidae. However, they are not right whales at all, and their taxonomy is presently in doubt. Most recent authors place this species into the <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> Family <a href="Neobalaenidae">Neobalaenidae</a>, but a 2012 study suggests that it is instead the last living member of the Family <a href="Cetotheriidae">Cetotheriidae</a>, a family previously considered extinct.

Yet another species of right whale was proposed by <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a> in the 18th century - the so-called Swedenborg whale. The description of this species was based on a collection of fossil bones unearthed at Norra Vånga, Sweden, in 1705 and believed to be those of <a href="giant%20%28mythology%29">giant</a>s. The bones were examined by Swedenborg, who realized they belong to a species of whale. The existence of this species has been debated, and further evidence for this species was discovered during the construction of a motorway in <a href="Str%C3%B6mstad">Strömstad</a>, Sweden in 2009. To date, however, scientific consensus still considers "Hunterius swedenborgii" to be a North Atlantic right whale. According to a DNA analysis conducted by scientists, it was later confirmed that the fossil bones are actually from a bowhead whale.

Due to their familiarity to whalers over a number of centuries, the right whales have had many names. These names were used throughout the world, reflecting the fact that only one species was recognized at the time. In his novel "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>", <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a> writes:

In fact, there "was" indeed a difference between the two – Melville's "Greenland whale", or "Greenland right whale", was in fact the modern-day bowhead whale, "Balaena mysticetus".

The following are <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a>s for the genus "Eubalaena":

Although the right whale is now officially in the genus "Eubalaena", the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> for a genus remains as it was first described – in the case of "Eubalaena" the type species is "Balaena australis" .

Some of the species-level synonyms are:

Unlike other whales, a right whale has distinctive <a href="callosity">callosities</a> (roughened patches of skin) on its head, along with a broad back without a <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a>, occasionally with white belly patches, and a long, arching rostrum, or upper jaw, that begins above the eye. The callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (<a href="whale%20lice">whale lice</a>).
Each individual has a unique callosities pattern. In 2016, a competitive effort resulted in the use of <a href="facial%20recognition%20software">facial recognition software</a> to derive a process to uniquely identify right whales with about 87% accuracy based on their callosities. The primary role of callosities has been considered to be protection against predators. Right whale declines might have also reduced barnacles. Right whales are very large, robust whales that can grow up to and over long and weigh up to , almost as big as <a href="bowhead%20whale">bowhead whale</a>s and much larger than other species with high dependencies on shallow waters. An unusually large 40% of their body weight is <a href="blubber">blubber</a>, which is of relatively low density. Consequently, unlike many other species of whale, dead right whales tend to float. Right whales swim slowly, reaching only at top speed. However, they are highly acrobatic and frequently <a href="Whale%20behavior">breach</a> (jump clear of the sea surface), <a href="tail-slap">tail-slap</a> and <a href="lobtail">lobtail</a>.

Adults may be between in length and typically weigh . The most typical lengths are . The body is extremely thick with girth as much as 60% of total body length in some cases. The tail fluke is broad (up to 40% of body length). The North Pacific species is on average the largest of the three species. The largest specimens may weigh . Right whales have a distinctive wide V-shaped blow, caused by the widely spaced <a href="Blowhole%20%28biology%29">blowhole</a>s on the top of the head. The blow rises above the surface. Right whales have between 200 and 300 <a href="baleen%20plate">baleen plate</a>s on each side of their mouths. These are narrow and approximately long, and are covered in very thin hairs. The plates enable the whale to filter feed.

The penis on a right whale can be up to – the <a href="testes">testes</a>, at up to in length, in diameter, and weighing up to 525 kg (1157 lbs), are also by far the largest of any animal on Earth. The <a href="blue%20whale">blue whale</a> may be the largest animal on the planet, yet the testicles of the right whale are ten times the size of those of the blue whale. They also exceed predictions in terms of relative size, as well – they are six times larger than would be expected on the basis of body mass. Together, the testicles make up nearly 1% of the right whale's total body weight. This strongly suggests <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a> is important in mating, which correlates to the fact that right whales are highly <a href="promiscuous">promiscuous</a>.

Many of southern right whales are seen with rolls of fats behind blowholes that northern species often lack, and these are regarded as a sign of better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, and could have contributed in vast differences in recovery status between right whales in the southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by mankind.

During the <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a>, which can occur at any time in the North Atlantic, right whales gather into "surface-active groups" made up of as many as 20 males consorting a single female. The female has her belly to the surface while the males stroke her with their flippers or keep her underwater. The males do not compete as aggressively against each other as male humpbacks. The female may not become pregnant but she is still able to assess the condition of potential mates. The mean age of first <a href="parturition">parturition</a> in North Atlantic right whales is estimated at between 7.5 and 9 years. Females breed every 3–5 years; the most commonly seen calving intervals are 3 years and may vary from 2 up to 21 years due to multiple factors.

Both reproduction and calving take place during the winter months. Calves are approximately in weight and in length at birth following a <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> of 1 year. The right whale grows rapidly in its first year, typically doubling in length. Weaning occurs after eight months to one year and the growth rate in later years is not well understood—it may be highly dependent on whether a calf stays with its mother for a second year.

Respective congregation areas in the same region may function as for different objectives for whales.

Very little is known about the life span of right whales. One of the few well-documented cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent <a href="callosity">callosity</a> patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related <a href="bowhead%20whale">bowhead whale</a> exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.

The right whales' diets consist primarily of <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>, primarily the tiny <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s called <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s, as well as <a href="krill">krill</a>, and <a href="pteropod">pteropod</a>s, although they are occasionally opportunistic feeders. As with other baleens, they feed by filtering prey from the water. They swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. The whale then expels the water, using its baleen plates to retain the prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be large enough that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough that it cannot escape. The "skimming" may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies.

The right whales' two known predators are humans and <a href="killer%20whale">orca</a>s. When danger lurks, a group of right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which sometimes proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, the sheer size of this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.

The three "Eubalaena" species inhabit three distinct areas of the globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and all areas of the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups with minor exclusions. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a>. In general, they prefer to stay close to <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s and bays and on <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelves</a>, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.

Because the oceans are so large, it is very difficult to accurately gauge whale population sizes. Approximate figures:


Almost all of the 400 North Atlantic right whales live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In northern spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> to <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>. Particularly popular feeding areas are the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> and <a href="Cape%20Cod%20Bay">Cape Cod Bay</a>. In winter, they head south towards <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to give birth. There have been a smattering of sightings further east over the past few decades; several sightings were made close to <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests they are more likely to be strays. However, a few sightings are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.

The North Pacific right whale appears to occur in two populations. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very little is known about this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a> in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of <a href="50th%20parallel%20north">50°N</a>. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a>. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.

The last major population review of southern right whales by the International Whaling Commission was in 1998. Researchers used data about adult female populations from three surveys (one in each of Argentina, South Africa and Australia) and extrapolated to include unsurveyed areas and estimated counts of males and calves (using available male:female and adult:calf ratios), giving an estimated 1997 population of 7,500 animals. More recent data from 2007 indicate those survey areas have shown evidence of strong recovery, with a population approaching twice that of a decade earlier. However, other breeding populations are still very small, and data are insufficient to determine whether they, too, are recovering.

The southern right whale spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Australia, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>. Since hunting of the southern right whale ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.

Vocalizations made by right whales are not elaborate compared to those made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may be a form of communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to <a href="Siren%20%28noisemaker%29">police sirens</a>—sounds of much higher <a href="frequency">frequency</a> than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts to reduce the number of ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.

In the early centuries of shore-based whaling before 1712, right whales were virtually the only catchable large whales, for three reasons:

<a href="Basque%20people">Basque people</a> were the first to hunt right whales commercially, beginning as early as the 11th century in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of <a href="Todos%20os%20Santos%20Bay">Todos os Santos Bay</a> (in <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Bahia</a>, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.

"Yankee whalers" from the new American colonies replaced the Basques. Setting out from <a href="Nantucket%2C%20Massachusetts">Nantucket, Massachusetts</a> and <a href="Long%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Long Island, New York</a>, they took up to 100 animals in good years. By 1750, the commercial hunt of the North Atlantic right whale was basically over. The Yankee whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The southernmost Brazilian whaling station was established in 1796, in <a href="Imbituba">Imbituba</a>. Over the next hundred years, Yankee whaling spread into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, where the Americans were joined by fleets from several European nations. The beginning of the 20th century saw much greater industrialization of whaling, and the harvest grew rapidly. By 1937, there had been, according to whalers' records, 38,000 takes in the South Atlantic, 39,000 in the South Pacific, 1,300 in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, and 15,000 in the North Pacific. The incompleteness of these records means the actual take was somewhat higher.

As it became clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued off the coast of Brazil for many years and the <a href="Imbituba">Imbituba</a> land station processed right whales until 1973. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.

The southern right whale has made <a href="Hermanus">Hermanus</a>, South Africa one of the world centers for whale watching. During the winter months (July–October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline, visitors can watch whales from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a "whale crier" (<a href="cf.">cf.</a> <a href="town%20crier">town crier</a>) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. Southern right whales can also be watched at other winter breeding grounds.

In Brazil, Imbituba in <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a> has been recognized as the National Right Whale Capital and holds annual Right Whale Week celebrations in September when mothers and calves are more often seen. The old whaling station there has been converted to a museum dedicated to the whales. In winter in Argentina, <a href="Pen%C3%ADnsula%20Vald%C3%A9s">Península Valdés</a> in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> hosts the largest breeding population of the species, with more than 2,000 animals catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and <a href="Ocean%20Alliance">Ocean Alliance</a>.

Both the North Atlantic and North Pacific species are listed as a "species threatened with extinction which [is] or may be affected by trade" (Appendix I) by <a href="CITES">CITES</a>, and as "endangered" by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. In the United States, the <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> (NMFS), a subagency of the <a href="NOAA">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) has classified all three species as "<a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>" under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. Under the <a href="Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act%20of%201972">Marine Mammal Protection Act</a>, they are listed as "depleted".

The southern right whale is listed as "endangered" under the Australian <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</a>, as "nationally endangered" under the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Threat%20Classification%20System">New Zealand Threat Classification System</a>, as a "natural monument" by the <a href="Argentine%20National%20Congress">Argentine National Congress</a>, and as a "State Natural Monument" under the Brazilian National Endangered Species List.

The US and Brazil added new protections for right whales in the 2000s to address the two primary hazards. While environmental campaigners were, as reported in 2001, pleased about the plan's positive effects, they attempted to force the US government to do more. In particular, they advocated speed limits for ships within of US ports in times of high right whale presence. Citing concerns about excessive trade disruption, it did not institute greater protections. The <a href="Defenders%20of%20Wildlife">Defenders of Wildlife</a>, the <a href="Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">Humane Society of the United States</a> and the Ocean Conservancy sued the NMFS in September 2005 for "failing to protect the critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, which the agency acknowledges is 'the rarest of all large whale species' and which federal agencies are required to protect by both the <a href="Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act%20of%201972">Marine Mammal Protection Act</a> and the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>", demanding emergency protection measures. According to NOAA researchers, about 83% of right whale sightings in the mid-Atlantic region occur within of shore.

The southern right whale, listed as "endangered" by CITES and "lower risk - conservation dependent" by the IUCN, is protected in the jurisdictional waters of all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Brazil, a federal <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Area%20%28Brazil%29">Environmental Protection Area</a> encompassing some and of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species' main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote whale watching.

On February 6, 2006, NOAA proposed its Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales. The proposal, opposed by some shipping interests, limited ship speeds during calving season. The proposal was made official when on December 8, 2008, NOAA issued a press release that included the following:


The <a href="Stellwagen%20Bank">Stellwagen Bank</a> area has implemented an autobuoy program to acoustically detect right whales in the Boston Approaches and notify <a href="sailor">sailor</a>s via the Right Whale Listening Network website.

The leading cause of death among the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates through some of the world's busiest shipping lanes while journeying off the east coast of the United States and Canada, is being struck by ships. At least 16 ship-strike deaths were reported between 1970 and 1999, and probably more remain unreported. According to NOAA, 25 of the 71 right whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.

A second major cause of morbidity and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in <a href="ocean%20plastic">plastic</a> <a href="fishing%20net">fishing gear</a>. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.

In 2012, the U.S. Navy proposed to create a new undersea naval training range immediately adjacent to northern right whale calving grounds in shallow waters off the Florida/Georgia border. Legal challenges by leading environmental groups including the <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Defense%20Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> were denied in federal court, allowing the Navy to proceed. These rulings were made despite the extremely low numbers (as low as 313 by some estimates) of right whales in existence at this time, and a very poor calving season.

Gyromitra esculenta

Gyromitra esculenta , is an <a href="Ascomycota">ascomycete</a> fungus from the genus "<a href="Gyromitra">Gyromitra</a>", widely distributed across Europe and North America. It normally fruits in sandy soils under <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> trees in spring and early summer. The <a href="Ascocarp">fruiting body</a>, or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> dark brown in colour that can reach high and wide, perched on a stout white <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> up to high.

Although potentially fatal if eaten raw, "Gyromitra esculenta" is a popular delicacy in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, Eastern Europe, and the upper <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region%20%28North%20America%29">Great Lakes region</a> of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Although popular in some districts of the eastern <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, it is prohibited from sale to the public in Spain. It may be sold fresh in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, but it must be accompanied by warnings and instructions on correct preparation.

Although it is still commonly <a href="parboil">parboil</a>ed before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make "Gyromitra esculenta" entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, <a href="gyromitrin">gyromitrin</a>, is <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a> into the toxic compound <a href="monomethylhydrazine">monomethylhydrazine</a> (MMH). The toxin <a href="hepatotoxicity">affects the liver</a>, <a href="neurotoxicity">central nervous system</a>, and sometimes the <a href="nephrotoxicity">kidneys</a>. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to <a href="delirium">delirium</a>, coma and death after five to seven days.

The fungus was first described in 1800, by <a href="mycologist">mycologist</a> <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a>, as "Helvella esculenta", and gained its current accepted <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> when the Swedish mycologist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> placed it in the genus "Gyromitra" in 1849. The genus name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> terms "gyros"/γυρος "round" and "mitra"/μιτρα "headband". Its specific epithet is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "esculentus", "edible".

It is known by a variety of common descriptive names such as "brain mushroom," "turban fungus," "elephant ears", or "beefsteak mushroom/morel," although "beefsteak mushroom" can also refer to the much less toxic basidiomycete "<a href="Fistulina%20hepatica">Fistulina hepatica</a>". Dating from the 19th century, the German term "lorchel" is a result of the older "lorche", itself from the 18th century <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> "Lorken", aligning with the similar-sounding (and similar-looking) "morchel".

"Gyromitra esculenta" is a member of a group of fungi known as "<a href="false%20morel">false morel</a>s", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded <a href="Morel">true morels of the genus "Morchella"</a>. The grouping includes other species of the genus "Gyromitra", such as "<a href="Gyromitra%20infula">G. infula</a>" (elfin saddle), "<a href="Gyromitra%20caroliniana">G. caroliniana</a>" and "<a href="Gyromitra%20gigas">G. gigas</a>" (snow morel). While some of these species contain little to no gyromitrin, many guidebooks recommend treating them all as poisonous, since their similar appearance and significant intraspecific variation can make reliable identification difficult.

The more distantly related ascomycete mushrooms of the genus "<a href="Verpa">Verpa</a>", such as "<a href="Verpa%20bohemica">V. bohemica</a>" and "<a href="Verpa%20conica">V. conica</a>", are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the "<a href="Gyromitra">Gyromitra</a>", they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.

The genus "Gyromitra" had been classically considered part of the family <a href="Helvellaceae">Helvellaceae</a>, along with the similar-looking elfin saddles of the genus "<a href="Helvella">Helvella</a>". Analysis of the <a href="ribosome">ribosomal</a> DNA of many of the <a href="Pezizales">Pezizales</a> showed "Gyromitra esculenta" and the other false morels to be only distantly related to the other members of the Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus "<a href="Discina%20%28fungus%29">Discina</a>", forming a <a href="clade">clade</a> which also contains "<a href="Pseudorhizina">Pseudorhizina</a>" and "<a href="Hydnotrya">Hydnotrya</a>". Thus the four genera are now included in the family <a href="Discinaceae">Discinaceae</a>.

Resembling a brain, the irregularly shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> may be up to high and wide. Initially smooth, it becomes progressively more wrinkled as it grows and ages. The cap colour may be various shades of reddish-, chestnut-, purplish-, bay-, dark or sometimes golden-brown. Specimens from California may have more reddish-brown caps. Attached to the cap at several points, the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> is high and wide. "Gyromitra esculenta" has a solid stipe whereas those of true morels ("<a href="Morchella">Morchella</a>" spp.) are hollow. The smell can be pleasant and has been described as fruity, and the fungus is mild-tasting. The spore print is whitish, with transparent spores that are elliptical and 17–22 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> in length.

"Gyromitra esculenta" resembles the various species of true morel, although the latter are more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s. Its cap is generally darker and larger.

"Gyromitra esculenta" grows on sandy soil in <a href="Temperate%20coniferous%20forest">Temperate coniferous forest</a> and occasionally in <a href="Temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous woodlands</a>. Among conifers it is mostly found under pines ("<a href="pine">Pinus</a>" spp.), but also sometimes under aspen ("<a href="Populus">Populus</a>" spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.

Although more abundant in <a href="Montane%20forest">montane</a> and northern coniferous woodlands such as the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> in northwestern North America, "Gyromitra esculenta" is found widely across the continent, as far south as <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, from <a href="U%C5%9Fak%20Province">Uşak Province</a> in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of <a href="Ka%C5%9F">Kaş</a> in the <a href="Antalya%20Province">Antalya Province</a> of Turkey's southern coast.

Toxic reactions have been known for at least a hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction was more of an <a href="Allergic%20reaction">allergic one</a> specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be poisoned after eating "Gyromitra esculenta" for many years without ill-effects. However, the fungus is now widely recognized as potentially deadly.

"Gyromitra esculenta" contains levels of the poison <a href="gyromitrin">gyromitrin</a> that vary locally among populations; although these mushrooms are only rarely involved in poisonings in either <a href="North%20America">North America</a> or western <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, intoxications are seen frequently in eastern Europe and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. A 1971 Polish study reported at the time that the species accounted for up to 23% of mushroom fatalities each year. Death rates have dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002. "Gyromitra" poisonings are rare in Spain, due to the widespread practice of drying the mushrooms before preparation and consumption, but has a mortality rate of about 25%.

A lethal dose of gyromitrin has been estimated to be 10–30 mg/kg for children and 20–50 mg/kg in adults. These doses correspond to around and of fresh mushroom respectively. However, individual responses may vary and people who have ingested similar amounts may develop anything from minimal to severe toxicity. Evidence suggests that children are more severely affected; it is unclear whether this is due to a larger weight consumed per body mass ratio or to differences in enzyme and metabolic activity. Although the amount of gyromitrin present can be significantly reduced through parboiling, there is evidence that repeated consumption can increase risk of toxicity.

Populations of "Gyromitra esculenta" appear to vary geographically in their toxicity. A French study has shown that mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there is some evidence that fungi west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.

The identity of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde "N"-methyl-"N"-formylhydrazone, better known as <a href="gyromitrin">gyromitrin</a>, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> <a href="solubility">water-soluble</a> <a href="hydrazine">hydrazine</a> compound hydrolyzed in the body into <a href="monomethylhydrazine">monomethylhydrazine</a> (MMH). Other "N"-methyl-"N"-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.

The toxins react with pyridoxal-5-phosphate—the activated form of
<a href="pyridoxine">pyridoxine</a>—and form a hydrazone. This reduces production of the neurotransmitter <a href="Gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">GABA</a> via decreased activity of <a href="glutamic%20acid%20decarboxylase">glutamic acid decarboxylase</a>, producing the neurological symptoms. MMH also causes oxidative stress leading to <a href="methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</a>. Additionally during the <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of MMH, "N"-methyl-"N"-formylhydrazine is produced; this then undergoes <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a> regulated oxidative metabolism which via reactive nitrosamide intermediates leads to formation of methyl radicals which lead to liver necrosis. Inhibition of <a href="diamine%20oxidase">diamine oxidase</a> (histaminase) elevates <a href="histamine">histamine</a> levels resulting in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The symptoms of poisoning are typically <a href="gastrointestinal">gastrointestinal</a> and <a href="neurological">neurological</a>. Symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, vomiting, and watery <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> which may be bloodstained. <a href="Dehydration">Dehydration</a> may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, <a href="Vertigo%20%28medical%29">vertigo</a>, tremor, <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>, <a href="Pathologic%20nystagmus">nystagmus</a>, and headaches develop soon after; <a href="fever">fever</a> often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.

In some cases there may be an <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including <a href="nephrotoxicity">kidney damage</a>, <a href="Hepatotoxicity">liver damage</a>, and <a href="neurotoxicity">neurological dysfunction</a> including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3 days in serious cases. The patient develops <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a> and the liver and <a href="spleen">spleen</a> become enlarged, in some cases <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a> levels will rise (<a href="hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</a>) and then fall (<a href="hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</a>) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular <a href="hemolysis">hemolysis</a> causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and <a href="hemoglobinuria">hemoglobinuria</a> which can lead to <a href="renal">renal</a> toxicity or <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a>. <a href="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</a> may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of <a href="methemoglobin">methemoglobin</a>, which is a form of <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a> that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and <a href="cyanosis">cyanotic</a>. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with <a href="delirium">delirium</a>, muscle <a href="fasciculation">fasciculation</a>s and seizures, and <a href="mydriasis">mydriasis</a> progressing to <a href="coma">coma</a>, circulatory collapse, and <a href="respiratory%20arrest">respiratory arrest</a>. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.

Treatment is mainly <a href="Therapy%23Supportive%20therapy">supportive</a>; gastric decontamination with <a href="activated%20charcoal">activated charcoal</a> may be beneficial if medical attention is sought within a few hours of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">intravenous</a> fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, <a href="urinalysis">urinalysis</a>, and <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a> is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. <a href="Hemodialysis">Dialysis</a> can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> to replace the lost red blood cells, while <a href="methemoglobinemia">methemoglobinemia</a> is treated with intravenous <a href="methylene%20blue">methylene blue</a>.

Pyridoxine, also known as <a href="vitamin%20B6">vitamin B6</a>, can be used to counteract the <a href="Enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibition</a> by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="Gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">GABA</a>. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25 mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30 g daily if symptoms do not improve. <a href="Benzodiazepine">Benzodiazepine</a>s are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a> into its active form, <a href="folinic%20acid">folinic acid</a>, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200 mg daily.

Monomethylhydrazine, as well as its precursors methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw "Gyromitra esculenta", have been shown to be <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>ic in experimental animals. Although "Gyromitra esculenta" has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from "Gyromitra esculenta", and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.

Despite its recognized toxicity, "Gyromitra esculenta" is marketed and consumed in several countries or states in Europe and North America. It was previously consumed in Germany, with fungi picked in and exported from <a href="Poland">Poland</a>; more recently, however, Germany and <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> discouraged consumption by prohibiting its sale. Similarly in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, the <a href="Swedish%20National%20Food%20Administration">Swedish National Food Administration</a> warns that it is not fit for human consumption, and restricts purchase of fresh mushrooms to restaurants alone. The mushroom is still highly regarded and consumed in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, being sold in markets and picked for export there. In some countries such as Spain, especially in the eastern <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, they are traditionally considered a delicacy, and many people report consuming them for many years with no ill effects. Despite this, the false morel is listed as hazardous in official mushroom lists published by the Catalan Government and sale to the public is prohibited throughout Spain. Outside of Europe, "Gyromitra esculenta" is consumed in the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region and some western states in the United States.

Selling and purchasing fresh false morels is legal in Finland, where it is highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are required by law to be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s in 2006 and 32.7 tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In <a href="Cuisine%20of%20Finland">Finnish cuisine</a>, false morels may be cooked in an <a href="omelette">omelette</a>, or gently <a href="saut%C3%A9e">sautée</a>d in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a <a href="b%C3%A9chamel%20sauce">béchamel sauce</a>, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include <a href="parsley">parsley</a>, <a href="chives">chives</a>, <a href="dill">dill</a> and <a href="black%20pepper">black pepper</a>.

In 2015, Swedish chef caused a controversy when he prepared a dish with "Gyromitra esculenta" in a TV show. Mushroom expert Monica Svensson criticized him for including it, because of the mushroom's carcinogenic substances and the risk that inexperienced people might misinterpret the recipe and omit the steps that reduce the toxicity level. She also expressed criticism to <a href="Per%20Morberg">Per Morberg</a> for similar reasons. Paul Svensson said that he wasn't aware of the carcinogenic effects and apologized afterwards, and he promised to remove the mushroom from his dishes.

Most of the gyromitrin must be removed to render false morels edible. The recommended procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom it is recommended that they are cut into small pieces and <a href="parboiling">parboiled</a> twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each <a href="unit%20operation">round</a> of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.

MMH boils at and thus readily vaporizes into the air when water containing fresh false morels is boiled. Poorly ventilated spaces allow vapor to accumulate, resulting in gyromitrin poisoning. If boiling the mushrooms indoors, care should be taken to ensure adequate ventilation, and, if symptoms of gyromitrin poisoning appear, immediately seek fresh air. Even after boiling, small amounts of gyromitrin remain in the mushrooms. Given the possibility of accumulation of toxins, repeated consumption is not recommended.

Strains with much lower concentrations of gyromitrin have been discovered, and the fungus has been successfully grown to fruiting in culture. Thus there is scope for future research into cultivation of safer strains.
