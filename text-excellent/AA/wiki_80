Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng

The Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (; ; "Vietnamese Nationalist Party"), abbreviated VNQDĐ or Việt Quốc, was a nationalist and moderate <a href="Socialism">socialist</a> political party that sought independence from <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonial rule</a> in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. In 1927, after the publishing house failed because of French harassment and censorship, the VNQDD was formed under the leadership of <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Th%C3%A1i%20H%E1%BB%8Dc">Nguyễn Thái Học</a>. Modelling itself on the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a>'s <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> (the same 3 characters in <a href="ch%E1%BB%AF%20H%C3%A1n">chữ Hán</a>: ) the VNQDD gained a following among northerners, particularly teachers and intellectuals. The party, which was less successful among peasants and industrial workers, was organised in small clandestine cells.

From 1928, the VNQDD attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. A turning point came in February 1929 with the <a href="Bazin%20assassination">Bazin assassination</a>, the killing of a French labour recruiter widely despised by local Vietnamese people. Although the perpetrators' precise affiliation was unclear, the French colonial authorities held the VNQDD responsible. Between 300 and 400 of the party's approximately 1,500 members were detained in the resulting crackdown. Many of the leaders were arrested, but Học managed to escape.

In late 1929, the party was weakened by an internal split. Under increasing French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals with a plan to expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched the <a href="Y%C3%AAn%20B%C3%A1i%20mutiny">Yên Bái mutiny</a> on February 10, 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country.

Some remaining factions sought peaceful means of struggle, while other groups fled across the border to Kuomintang bases in the <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> province of China, where they received arms and training. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>'s <a href="Indochinese%20Communist%20Party">Indochinese Communist Party</a> (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Japan</a> during World War II and, in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945, the VNQDD and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. However, after a falling out, Ho purged the VNQDD, leaving his communist-dominated <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>, Vietnam was <a href="Partition%20of%20Vietnam">partitioned into two zones</a>. The remnants of the VNQDD fled to the <a href="capitalist">capitalist</a> <a href="South%20Vietnam">south</a>, where they remained until the <a href="Fall%20of%20Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a> in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. Today, the party survives only among <a href="overseas%20Vietnamese">overseas Vietnamese</a>.
French involvement in Vietnam started in the late 18th century when the Catholic priest <a href="Pigneau%20de%20Behaine">Pigneau de Behaine</a> assisted <a href="Gia%20Long">Nguyễn Ánh</a>, to found the <a href="Nguyen%20Dynasty">Nguyen Dynasty</a> by recruiting French volunteers. In return, Nguyen Anh, who took the reign name <a href="Gia%20Long">Gia Long</a> allowed Catholic missionaries to operate in Vietnam. However, relations became strained under Gia Long's successor <a href="Minh%20Mang">Minh Mang</a> as missionaries sought to <a href="Le%20Van%20Khoi%20revolt">incite revolts in an attempt to enthrone a Catholic</a>. This prompted anti-Christian edicts, and in 1858, a French invasion of Vietnam was mounted, ostensibly to protect Catholicism, but in reality for colonial purposes. The French steadily made gains and completed the colonisation of Vietnam in 1883. Armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly, most notably through the <a href="Can%20Vuong">Can Vuong</a> movement of the late-1880s. In the early-20th century, the <a href="1916%20Cochinchina%20uprising">1916 southern revolts</a> and the <a href="Thai%20Nguyen%20uprising">Thai Nguyen uprising</a> were notable disruptions to the French administration.

In late 1925, a small group of young <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>-based intellectuals, led by a teacher named <a href="Pham%20Tuan%20Tai">Pham Tuan Tai</a> and his brother <a href="Pham%20Tuan%20Lam">Pham Tuan Lam</a>, started the <a href="Nam%20Dong%20Thu%20Xa">Nam Dong Thu Xa</a> (Southeast Asia Publishing House). They aimed to promote violent revolution as a means of gaining independence for Vietnam from <a href="French%20Indochina">French colonisation</a>, and published books and brochures about <a href="Sun%20Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a> and the <a href="Xinhai%20Revolution">Chinese Revolution of 1911</a>, as well as opening a free school to teach "<a href="quoc%20ngu">quoc ngu</a>" (Romanised Vietnamese script) to the working class. The group soon attracted the support of other progressive young northerners, including students and teachers led by <a href="Nguyen%20Thai%20Hoc">Nguyen Thai Hoc</a>. Hoc was an alumnus of Hanoi's Commercial School, who had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance. Hoc had previously tried to initiate peaceful reforms by making written submissions to the French authorities, but these were ignored, and his attempt to foster policy change through the publication of a magazine never materialised due to the refusal of a licence.

Harassment and censorship imposed by the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards more direct political action, in a bid to appeal to more radical elements in the north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.

At the time, nationalist sentiment had been on the increase in Vietnam. The French colonial authorities were bringing more Vietnamese into the administration, and there was a small but growing proportion who were exposed to a western education. As a result, they became aware of French ideals such as <a href="Libert%C3%A9%2C%20%C3%A9galit%C3%A9%2C%20fraternit%C3%A9">Liberté, égalité, fraternité</a>, republicanism and democracy, which sharply contrasted to the racial equality and stratified system of the colonial elite ruling the masses in Vietnam. There was also an increasing awareness of the political writings of <a href="Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a> and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, which stoked a desire for civil and political rights, combined with the knowledge of the Japanese victory over Russia in 1905, which gave people confidence that Asians could defeat western powers.

The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD) was formed at a meeting in <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> on December 25, 1927, with Nguyen Thai Hoc as the party's first leader. It was Vietnam's first home-grown revolutionary party, established three years before the <a href="Indochinese%20Communist%20Party">Indochinese Communist Party</a>. The party advocated <a href="socialism">socialism</a>, but at the outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives. Many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution, rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent Vietnamese republic; but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism, putting off potential Vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence. In a bid for moderation, the final statement was a compromise that read:

A manifesto released in February 1930 showed that the VNQDD heavily based its rhetoric on appealing to resentment against the system of racial inequality and the French imposition of capitalism. It appealed to the populace to rise up against colonisation and the poor treatment of Vietnamese people. It assailed the French for restricting the Vietnamese people's ability to study, discuss policy and associate, and what it perceived as exploitative capitalist policies that enriched French enterprises while leaving Vietnamese people unhealthy. It criticised the colonial administration, which it saw as corrupt and encouraging low-level Vietnamese bureaucrats to mistreat their compatriots, and said that the ouster to French rule was necessary to stop the "elimination process" against the Vietnamese race.

In order to attain its primary aim of independence, the VNQDD had three principles by which it intended to operate. The first was nationalism, under which people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam were to be citizens of a sovereign nation. Secondly, democracy was to give citizens the right to vote, impeach elected officials, ratify and abolish laws. The third and final principle was to implement socialist controls on the economy, and restricting capitalism through nationalisation, guaranteed minimum working conditions and land reform. This was ultimately aimed towards reducing income inequality. There had been a debate over the socioeconomic bent of the party when it was formed, with some advocating communism and others private property, but the position reached was not dissimilar from an existing Vietnamese social norm where villagers often owned land communally although social hierarchies still existed. Although the socioeconomic side of the VNQDD agenda was not as heavily promoted at a high political level as the other two principles, there was a strong push at grassroots level to implement more socialist systems.

Although the VNQDD modelled itself on <a href="Sun%20Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a>'s Chinese Nationalist Party (the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> or KMT, later led by <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>), even down to copying the "Nationalist Party" designation, it had no direct relationship with its Chinese counterpart and in fact did not gain much attention outside Vietnam until the <a href="Yen%20Bay%20mutiny">Yen Bay mutiny</a> in 1930. However, in elucidating its primary objective of national independence, it did rely ideologically on Súns <a href="Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People">Three Principles of the People</a> (nationalism, people's welfare and human rights). Like the KMT, it was a clandestine organisation held together with tight discipline. Its basic unit was the cell, above which there were several levels of administration, including provincial, regional and central committees. Also like the KMT, the VNQDD's revolutionary strategy envisaged a military takeover, followed by a period of political training for the population before a constitutional government could take control.

Most party members were teachers, young people who had been exposed to a western education and political theory, employees of the French colonial government, Confucian-oriented village notables, or non-commissioned officers in the colonial army. In particular, they sought to cultivate support among <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a>s who would then be able to mobilise their enlisted men. This led to a membership based heavily on traditional Asian and western-style political elites. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of society—there were few workers or peasants in its support base, and those that were supporters of the VNQDD, were put into affiliated organisations that were adjunct to the parent organisation. The party's popularity was based on a groundswell of anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Champa">Champa</a>, <a href="Siam">Siam</a> and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. Talks with the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party (NVRP) failed because the NVRP wanted a more centralised and structured party organisation, although the VNQDD did manage to absorb the NVRP branch in Hung Hoa. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a> for betraying the leading nationalist of the time—<a href="Phan%20Boi%20Chau">Phan Boi Chau</a>—to the French in return for a financial reward. Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals. The VNQDD would later be on the receiving end of another of Ho's manoeuvres.

Financial problems compounded the VNQDD's difficulties. Money was needed to set up a commercial enterprise, a cover for the revolutionaries to meet and plot, and for raising funds. For this purpose, a hotel-restaurant named the "Vietnam Hotel" was opened in September 1928. The French colonial authorities were aware of the real purpose of the business, and put it under surveillance without taking further preliminary action. The first notable reorganisation of the VNQDD was in December, when <a href="Nguyen%20Khac%20Nhu">Nguyen Khac Nhu</a> replaced Hoc as chairman. Three proto-governmental organs were created, to form the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government. The records of the French secret service estimated that by early 1929, the VNQDD consisted of approximately 1,500 members in 120 cells, mostly in areas around the <a href="Red%20River%20Delta">Red River Delta</a>. The intelligence reported that most members were students, minor merchants or low-level bureaucrats in the French administration. The report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among the members, but that few were of scholar-gentry (<a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a>) rank. According to the historian Cecil B. Currey, "The VNQDD's lower-class origins made it, in many ways, closer to the labouring poor than were the Communists, many of whom…[were] from established middle-class families." At the time, the two other notable nationalist organisations were the communists and the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party, and although they had different visions of a post-independence nation, both competed with the VNQDD in attracting the support of the small, educated, urban class. In the late-1920s, around half of the communists were from bourgeoise backgrounds.

Beginning in 1928, the VNQDD attracted substantial Vietnamese support, provoking increased attention from the French colonial administration. This came after a VNQDD <a href="death%20squad">death squad</a> killed several French officials and Vietnamese collaborators who had a reputation for cruelty towards the Vietnamese populace.

The assassination of <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, was a turning point that marked the beginning of the VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. The sources disagree on whether the party adopted a policy of sanctioning the assassination. One account is that Hoc felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French "<a href="S%C3%BBret%C3%A9">Sûreté</a>", thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus. Another view is that the senior VNQDD leaders felt that killing Bazin was necessary so that the party would appear to be relevant to workers involved in industry or commerce, given that the communists had begun to target this demographic for their recruitment drives.

The first account says that, turned down by the VNQDD leadership, one of the assassination's proponents—it is unclear whether or not he was a party member—created his own plot. With an accomplice, he shot and killed Bazin on February 9, 1929, as the Frenchman left his <a href="mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a>'s house. The French attributed the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find: between three and four hundred men were rounded up, including 36 government clerks, 13 French government officials, 36 schoolteachers, 39 merchants, 37 landowners and 40 military personnel. The subsequent trials resulted in 78 men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Hoc and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.

In 1929, the VNQDD split when a faction led by <a href="Nguyen%20The%20Nghiep">Nguyen The Nghiep</a> began to disobey party orders and was therefore expelled from the Central Committee. Some sources claim that Nghiep had formed a breakaway party and had begun secret contacts with French authorities.

Perturbed by those who betrayed fellow members to the French and the problems this behaviour caused, Hoc convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of <a href="Lac%20Dao">Lac Dao</a>, along the Gia Lam-Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Hoc argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Hoc's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in an attack on the two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>, because the party was weak elsewhere.

For the remainder of 1929, the party prepared for the revolt. They located and manufactured weapons, storing them in hidden depots. The preparation was hindered by French police, particularly the seizure of arms caches. Recruitment campaigns and grassroots activist drives were put in place, even though the VNQDD were realistic and understood that their assault was unlikely to succeed. The village elders were used to mobilise neighbours into the political movement. Their logic was "Even if victory is not achieved, we will fully mature as human beings with our [heroic] efforts".

At around 01:30 on Monday, February 10, 1930, approximately 40 troops belonging to the 2nd Battalion of the Fourth "Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois" stationed at <a href="Y%C3%AAn%20B%C3%A1i">Yên Bái</a>, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDD, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The rebels had intended to split into three groups: the first group was to infiltrate the infantry, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support among Vietnamese troops; the second, supported by the VNQDD civilians, was to break into the post headquarters; and the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The French were caught off guard; five were killed and three seriously wounded. The mutineers isolated a few more French officers from their men, even managing to raise the VNQDD flag above one of the buildings. About two hours later, however, it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, and the remaining 550 Vietnamese soldiers helped quell the rebellion rather than participate in it. The insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the "Garde indigène" town post and could not convince the frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a French Indochinese counterattack scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yên Bái.

That same evening, two further insurrectionary attempts failed in the <a href="S%C6%A1n%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20District">Sơn Dương</a> sector. A raid on the "Garde indigène" post in <a href="H%C6%B0ng%20H%C3%B3a">Hưng Hóa</a> was repelled by the Vietnamese guards, who appeared to have been tipped off. In the nearby town of <a href="Kinh%20Khe">Kinh Khe</a>, VNQDD members killed the instructor <a href="Nguyen%20Quang%20Kinh">Nguyen Quang Kinh</a> and one of his wives. After destroying the "Garde indigène" post in <a href="L%C3%A2m%20Thao">Lâm Thao</a>, the VNQDD briefly seized control of the district seat. At sunrise, a new "Garde indigène" unit arrived and inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents, mortally wounding Nhu. Aware of the events in the upper delta region, <a href="Pho%20Duc%20Chinh">Pho Duc Chinh</a> fled and abandoned a planned attack on the <a href="S%C6%A1n%20T%C3%A2y%20%28Hanoi%29">Sơn Tây</a> garrison, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities.

On February 10, a VNQDD member injured a policeman at a Hanoi checkpoint; at night, Arts students threw bombs at government buildings, which they regarded as part of the repressive power of the colonial state. On the night of February 15–16, Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of <a href="Phu%20Duc">Phu Duc</a> and <a href="V%C4%A9nh%20B%E1%BA%A3o">Vĩnh Bảo</a>, in <a href="Th%C3%A1i%20B%C3%ACnh%20Province">Thái Bình</a> and <a href="H%E1%BA%A3i%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Province">Hải Dương</a> provinces respectively, for a few hours. In the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at <a href="Co%20Am">Co Am</a> village; on the same day, <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>'s Resident Superior <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Robin">René Robin</a> dispatched 200 "Gardes indigènes", eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General <a href="Pierre%20Pasquier">Pierre Pasquier</a> declared that the insurrection had been defeated. Học and his lieutenants, Chinh and <a href="Nguyen%20Thanh%20Loi">Nguyen Thanh Loi</a>, were apprehended.

A series of trials were held to prosecute those arrested during the uprising. The largest number of death penalties was handed down by the first Criminal Commission, which convened at Yen Bay. Among the 87 people found guilty at Yen Bay, 46 were servicemen. Some argued in their own defence that they had been "surprised and forced to take part in the insurrection". Of the 87 convicted, 39 were sentenced to death, five to deportation, 33 to life sentences of forced labour, nine to 20 years imprisonment, and one to five years of forced labour. Of those condemned to death, 24 were civilians and 15 were servicemen. Presidential pardons reduced the number of death penalties from 39 to 13. Học and Chinh were among the 13 who were executed on June 17, 1930. The condemned men cried "Viet Nam!" as the guillotine fell. Học wrote a final plea to the French, in a letter that claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with French authorities, but that their intransigence had forced him to revolt. Học contended that France could only stay in Indochina if they dropped their "brutal" policies, and became more amiable towards the Vietnamese. The VNQDD leader called for universal education, training in commerce and industry, and an end to the corrupt practices of the French-installed mandarins.

Following Yen Bay, the VNQDD became more diffuse, with many factions effectively acting virtually autonomously of one another. <a href="Le%20Huu%20Canh">Le Huu Canh</a>—who had tried to stall the failed mutiny—attempted to reunite what remained of the party under the banner of peaceful reform. Other factions, however, remained faithful to Học's legacy, recreating the movement in the Hanoi-Haiphong area. A failed assassination attempt on Governor-General Pasquier led to French crackdowns in 1931 and 1932. The survivors escaped to <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> in southern China, where some of Nghiep's supporters were still active. The Yunnan VNQDD was in fact a section of the Chinese Kuomintang, who protected its members from the Chinese government while funds were raised by robbery and extortion along the Sino-Vietnamese border. This eventually led to a Chinese government crackdown, but VNQDD members continued to train at the Yunnan Military School; some enlisted in the nationalist Chinese army while others learned to manufacture weapons and munitions in the Yunnan arsenal.

Nghiep was briefly jailed by Yunnan authorities, but continued to run the party from his cell. Upon his release in 1933, Nghiep consolidated the party with similar groups in the area, including some followers of <a href="Phan%20B%E1%BB%99i%20Ch%C3%A2u">Phan Bội Châu</a> who had formed a <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>-based organisation with similar aims in 1925. Chau's group had formed in opposition to the communist tendencies of <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>'s Revolutionary Youth League. However, Ho betrayed Chau to eliminate a potential rival and to pocket a reward. With nationalist Chinese aid, Chau's followers had set up a League of Oppressed Oriental Peoples, a Pan-Asian group that ended in failure. In 1932 the League made the point of declaring a "Provisional Indochinese Government" at Canton. In July 1933, Chau's group was integrated into Nghiep's Yunnan organisation. In 1935, Nghiep surrendered to the French consulate in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. The remainder of the VNQDD was paralysed by infighting and began losing political relevance, with only moderate activity until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and <a href="Invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">Japan's invasion of French Indochina</a> in 1940. They attempted to organise workers along the Yunnan railway, threatening occasional border assaults, with little success.

The VNQDD was gradually overshadowed as the leading Vietnamese independence organisation by Ho's <a href="Indochinese%20Communist%20Party">Indochinese Communist Party</a> (ICP). In 1940, Ho arrived in Yunnan, which was a hotbed of both ICP and VNQDD activity. He initiated collaboration between the ICP and other nationalists such as the VNQDD. At the time, World War II had broken out and Japan had conquered most of eastern China and replaced the French in Vietnam. Ho moved east to the neighbouring province of <a href="Guangxi">Guangxi</a>, where Chinese military leaders had been attempting to organise Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army. Under the umbrella of KMT activities, a broad alliance of nationalists emerged. With Ho at the forefront, the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi</a> (Vietnamese Independence League, usually known as the Viet Minh) was formed and based in the town of <a href="Chinghsi">Chinghsi</a>. The pro-VNQDD nationalist <a href="Ho%20Ngoc%20Lam">Ho Ngoc Lam</a>, a KMT army officer and former disciple of Phan Boi Chau, was named as the deputy of <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng">Phạm Văn Đồng</a>, later to be Ho's Prime Minister. The front was later broadened and renamed the <a href="Viet%20Nam%20Giai%20Phong%20Dong%20Minh">Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh</a> (Vietnam Liberation League). It was an uneasy situation, as another VNQDD leader, <a href="Truong%20Boi%20Cong">Truong Boi Cong</a>, a graduate of a KMT military academy, wanted to challenge the communists for pre-eminence, while <a href="V%C5%A9%20H%E1%BB%93ng%20Khanh">Vũ Hồng Khanh</a> led a virulently anti-communist VNQDD faction. The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General <a href="Zhang%20Fakui">Zhang Fakui</a> created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the <a href="Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People">Three Principles of the People</a>, created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Vietnamese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyen Hai Than, who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese. General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces. At one stage, the communists made an appeal for other Vietnamese anti-colonialists to join forces, but condemned Khanh as an "opportunist" and "fake revolutionary" in their letter. The cooperation in the border area lasted for only a few months before VNQDD officials complained to the local KMT officials that the communists, led by Dong and <a href="V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p">Võ Nguyên Giáp</a>, were attempting to dominate the league. This prompted the local authorities to shut down the front's activities.

In March 1945, the VNQDD received a boost, when <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a>, which had occupied Vietnam since 1941, deposed the French administration, and installed the <a href="Empire%20of%20Vietnam">Empire of Vietnam</a>, a puppet regime. This resulted in the release of some anti-French activists, including VNQDD members.

On August 15, 1945, Japanese surrendered to Republic of China in Vietnam. General Lu Han (盧漢) was the representative of the Nationalist Army. The government of Republic of China favored VNQDD over Viet Minh which led to Ho's reliance on the rebel Chinese communist.

Ho's <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> seized power and set up a provisional government in the wake of Japan's withdrawal from Vietnam. This move violated a prior agreement between the member parties of the Viet Nam Cach Mang Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Revolutionary League), which included the VNQDD as well as the Vietminh, and Ho was pressured to broaden his government's appeal by including the VNQDD (now led by <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20T%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%20Tam">Nguyễn Tường Tam</a>). The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin governance system</a> and hold national elections with universal suffrage in two hold. The VNQDD objected to this, fearing that the communists would perpetrate electoral fraud.

After the seizure of power, hundreds of VNQDD members returned from China, only to be killed at the border by the Vietminh. Nevertheless, the VNQDD arrived in northern Vietnam with arms and supplies from the KMT, in addition to its prestige as a Vietnamese nationalist organisation. <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29">Nationalist China</a> backed the VNQDD in the hope of gaining more influence over its southern neighbour. Ho tried to broaden his support in order to strengthen himself, in addition to decreasing Chinese and French power. He hoped that by co-opting VNQDD members, he could shut out the KMT. The communists had no intention of sharing power with anyone in the long term and regarded the move as purely a strategic exercise. Giap, the Vietminh's military chief, called the VNQDD a "group of reactionaries plotting to rely on Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang and their rifle barrels to snatch a few crumbs". The VNQDD dominated the main control lines between northern Vietnam and China near <a href="L%C3%A0o%20Cai">Lào Cai</a>. They funded their operations from the tribute that they levied from the local populace. Once the majority of the non-communist nationalists had returned to Vietnam, the VNQDD banded with them to form an anti-Vietminh alliance. The VNQDD and the <a href="Dai%20Viet%20Quoc%20Dan%20Dang">Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang</a> (DVQDD, Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) started their own military academy at <a href="Y%C3%AAn%20B%C3%A1i">Yên Bái</a> to train their own military recruits. Armed confrontations between the Vietminh and the nationalists occurred regularly in major northern cities. The VNQDD were aided by the KMT, who were in northern Vietnam as the result of an international agreement to stabilise the country. The KMT often disarmed local Vietminh bands.

The VNQDD then established their national headquarters in <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>, and began to publish newspapers, expounding their policies and explaining their ideology. The <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">OSS</a> agent <a href="Archimedes%20Patti">Archimedes Patti</a>, who was based in Kunming and northern Vietnam, reported that the VNQDD were "hopelessly disoriented politically" and felt that they had no idea of how to run a government. He speculated that the VNQDD were driven by "desires for personal power and economic gain". Giap accused them of being "bandits". Military and newspaper attacks between the groups occurred regularly, but a power-sharing agreement was put in place until the elections occurred in order to end the attacks and strengthen national unity to further the goal of independence. The communists also allowed the VNQDD to continue printing material.

However, the agreement was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister <a href="Tran%20Huy%20Lieu">Tran Huy Lieu</a> and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's <a href="V%C5%A9%20H%E1%BB%93ng%20Khanh">Vũ Hồng Khanh</a> became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement turned out to be a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.

Ho scheduled elections for December 23, but he made a deal with the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi, which assured them of 50 and 20 seats in the new national assembly respectively, regardless of the poll results. This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government, in which Tam served as foreign minister. For the communists' part, they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD, and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations. The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation, citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.

The <a href="Ho%E2%80%93Sainteny%20agreement">Ho–Sainteny agreement</a>, signed on March 6, 1946, saw the return of French colonial forces to Vietnam, replacing the Chinese nationalists who were supposed to be maintaining order. The VNQDD were now without their main supporters. As a result, the VNQDD were further attacked by the French, who often encircled VNQDD strongholds, enabling Viet Minh attacks. Giáp's army hunted down VNQDD troops and cleared them from the <a href="Red%20River%20Delta">Red River Delta</a>, seizing arms and arresting party members, who were falsely charged with crimes ranging from counterfeiting to unlawful arms possession. The Viet Minh massacred thousands of VNQDD members and other nationalists in a large scale purge. Most of the survivors fled to China or French-controlled areas in Vietnam. After driving the VNQDD out of their Hanoi headquarters on On Nhu Hau Street, Giáp ordered his agents to construct an underground torture chamber on the premises. They then planted exhumed and badly decomposed bodies in the chamber, and accused the VNQDD of gruesome murders, although most of the dead were VNQDD members who had been killed by Giáp's men. The communists made a public spectacle of the scene in an attempt to discredit the VNQDD, but the truth eventually came out and the "On Nhu Hau Street affair" lowered their public image.

When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD seats were filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 remained by the end of the session. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office. In any case, the VNQDD never had any power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met only once a year. In any case, the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> went into full flight. A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.

After Vietnam gained independence in 1954, the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Accords</a> <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partitioned the country</a> into a communist north and an anti-communist south, but stipulated that there were to be 300 days of free passage between the two zones. During <a href="Operation%20Passage%20to%20Freedom">Operation Passage to Freedom</a>, most VNQDD members migrated to the south.

The VNQDD was deeply divided after years of communist pressure, lacked strong leadership and no longer had a coherent military presence, although they had a large presence in central Vietnam. The party's disarray was only exacerbated by the actions of autocratic President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, who imprisoned many of its members. Diem's administration was a "dictatorship by Catholics—A new kind of fascism", according to the title of a VNQDD pamphlet published in July 1955. The VNQDD tried to revolt against Diem in 1955 in central Vietnam. During the transition period after Geneva, the VNQDD sought to set up a new military academy in central Vietnam, but they were crushed by <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20C%E1%BA%A9n">Ngô Đình Cẩn</a>, who ran the region for his elder brother Diệm, dismantled and jailed VNQDD members and leaders.

Many officers in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> felt that Diệm discriminated against them because of their political leanings. Diệm used the secret Catholic <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao%20Party">Cần Lao Party</a> to keep control of the army and stifle attempts by VNQDD members to rise through the ranks.

During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were implicated in two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, allowing time for loyalists to relieve the president. Many of the officers involved had links to or were members of the VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and <a href="V%C5%A9%20H%E1%BB%93ng%20Khanh">Vũ Hồng Khanh</a> were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">Republic of Vietnam Air Force</a> pilots, <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20C%E1%BB%AB">Nguyễn Văn Cừ</a>—son of a prominent VNQDD leader—and <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20Ph%C3%BA%20Qu%E1%BB%91c">Phạm Phú Quốc</a>, bombarded the <a href="Reunification%20Palace">Independence Palace</a> in a bid to kill the president and his family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">deposed in a military coup</a> and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">killed in November 1963</a>. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.

Many VNQDD members were part of the ARVN, which sought to prevent <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> from being overrun by communists during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and they were known for being more anti-communist than most of their compatriots.

After the fall of Diệm and the execution of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary counter-insurgency forces organised by <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Nam%20Province">Quảng Nam</a> approached the Australians in an attempt to have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.

In 1966, the <a href="Buddhist%20Uprising">Buddhist Uprising</a> erupted in central Vietnam, in which some Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war, hoping to end foreign involvement in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them.

On April 19, clashes erupted in <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i%20Province">Quảng Ngãi Province</a> between the Buddhists and the VNQDD, prompting the local ARVN commander <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a> to forcibly restrain the two groups. Three days later the VNQDD accused the Buddhists of attacking their premises in <a href="H%E1%BB%99i%20An">Hội An</a> and <a href="Da%20Nang">Da Nang</a>, while US officials reported that the VNQDD were making plans to assassinate leading Buddhists, such as the activist monk <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Tr%C3%AD%20Quang">Thích Trí Quang</a>.

The VNQDD contested their national elections of 1967, the first elections since the fall of Diem, which were rigged—Diem and his people invariably gained more than 95% of the vote and sometimes exceeded the number of registered voters. The campaign was disorganised due to a lack of infrastructure and some VNQDD candidates were not formally sanctioned by any hierarchy. The VNQDD focused on the districts in <a href="I%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">I Corps</a> in central Vietnam where they were thought to be strong. There were 60 seats in the senate, and the six victorious tickets would see all ten of their members elected. The VNQDD entered eight tickets in the senate election, and while they totalled 15% of the national vote between them, the most of any grouping, it was diluted between the groupings; none of the tickets and thus none of the candidates were elected. This contrasted with one Catholic alliance with three tickets that won only 8% of the vote, but had all 30 candidates elected. They won nine seats in the lower house, a small minority presence, all from districts in central Vietnam, where they tended to poll between 20 and 40% in various areas. The VNQDD members made several loose alliances with <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> members of the lower house.
During the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a> of 1968, the communists attacked and seized control of the central city of <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a> for a month. During this time, they executed around 3,000–6,000 people that they had taken prisoner, out of a total population of 140,000. The communists had compiled a list of "reactionaries" to be liquidated before their assault. Known for their virulent anti-communism, VNQDD members appeared to have been disproportionately targeted in the massacre.

After the <a href="Fall%20of%20Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a> and the end of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the remnants of the VNQDD were again targeted by the victorious communists. As Vietnam is a single-party state led by the <a href="Vietnamese%20Communist%20Party">Vietnamese Communist Party</a>, the VNQDD is illegal. Some VNQDD members fled to the <a href="Western%20world">West</a>, where they continued their political activities. The VNQDD remains respected among some sections of the overseas Vietnamese community as Vietnam's leading anti-communist organisation.

German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I

The German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I was the first of two <a href="military%20occupation">military occupation</a>s of the <a href="Luxembourg">Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</a> by Germany in the 20th century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> was under full occupation by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their <a href="army">armies</a> in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.

During this period, Luxembourg was allowed to retain its own government and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and <a href="constitutional%20reform">constitutional reform</a>.

The domestic political environment was further complicated by the death of <a href="Paul%20Eyschen">Paul Eyschen</a>, who had been <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Luxembourg">Prime Minister</a> for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.

Since the 1867 <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281867%29">Treaty of London</a>, Luxembourg had been an explicitly <a href="neutral%20country">neutral state</a>. The <a href="Luxembourg%20Crisis">Luxembourg Crisis</a> had seen <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> thwart France's attempt to purchase the Grand Duchy from the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Luxembourg's neutrality was accepted by Prussia's then-<a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%28German%20Reich%29">Chancellor</a>, <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, who boasted, "In exchange for the fortress of Luxembourg, we have been compensated by the neutrality of the country, and a guarantee that it shall be maintained in perpetuity."

In June 1914, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>, heir to the thrones of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, was <a href="Assassination%20in%20Sarajevo">assassinated</a> by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden deterioration in relations between Austria-Hungary and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. Austria-Hungary was supported by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, while Serbia had the backing of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the <a href="mobilization">mobilisation</a> of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the <a href="Dual%20Alliance%2C%201879">Dual Alliance</a>.

Since the 1860s, Luxembourgers had been keenly aware of German ambition, and Luxembourg's government was well aware of the implications of the Schlieffen Plan. In 1911, Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Eyschen">Paul Eyschen</a> commissioned an engineer to evaluate Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to <a href="annexation">annex</a> Luxembourg into its empire. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality.

On 1 August 1914, Germany declared war on Russia. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for <a href="Albrecht%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Albrecht von Württemberg's</a> <a href="4th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">Fourth Army</a>. One of the railways from the northern <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> into France passed through <a href="Troisvierges">Troisvierges</a>, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of <a href="Troisvierges%20railway%20station">Troisvierges station</a>. Eyschen protested, but could do nothing to prevent Germany's incursion.

The next day, while French troops were still at a distance from the German frontier, Germany launched a full invasion. German soldiers began moving through south-eastern Luxembourg, crossing the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle River</a> at <a href="Remich">Remich</a> and <a href="Wasserbillig">Wasserbillig</a>, and headed towards the capital, <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg City</a>. Tens of thousands of German soldiers had been deployed to Luxembourg in those 24 hours (although the Grand Duchy's government disputed any precise number that was suggested). <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Luxembourg">Grand Duchess</a> <a href="Marie-Ad%C3%A9la%C3%AFde%2C%20Grand%20Duchess%20of%20Luxembourg">Marie-Adélaïde</a> ordered that the Grand Duchy's small army, which numbered under 400, not to resist. On the afternoon of 2 August she and Eyschen met the German commander "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" <a href="Richard%20Karl%20von%20Tessmar">Richard Karl von Tessmar</a> on <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg City</a>'s <a href="Adolphe%20Bridge">Adolphe Bridge</a>, the symbol of Luxembourg's modernisation. They protested mildly, but both the young Grand Duchess and her aging statesman accepted German military rule as inevitable.

On 2 August, German Chancellor <a href="Theobald%20von%20Bethmann%20Hollweg">Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg</a> justified the complete occupation of Luxembourg in terms of military necessity, arguing that France was ready to invade Luxembourg itself. The French minister in Luxembourg dismissed this argument, claiming that it would not have considered violating Luxembourg's neutrality unless Germany had done so first. Bethmann Hollweg attempted to prove his country's regret by offering Luxembourg compensation for the losses due to the military presence. On 4 August, Bethmann Hollweg told the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a>: 

However, when it seemed that Germany was on the verge of victory, the Chancellor began to revise his statements. In his "<a href="Septemberprogramm">Septemberprogramm</a>", Bethmann Hollweg called for Luxembourg to become a German federal state, and for that result to be forced upon the Luxembourgish people once Germany achieved victory over the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a>. However, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> and French halted the German advance at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne">Battle of the Marne</a> in mid-September. This resulted in the indefinite continuation of German occupation.

Just as the war was in the balance on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, so the fate of Luxembourg was see-sawing back and forth. It was clear to all that the good conduct of the Luxembourgish government, if fully receptive to the needs of the German military administrators, could guarantee Luxembourg's continued self-government, at least in the short-term. <a href="Paul%20Eyschen">Eyschen</a> was a familiar and overwhelmingly popular leader, and all factions put their utmost faith in his ability to steer Luxembourg through the diplomatic minefield that was occupation. On 4 August 1914, he expelled the French minister in Luxembourg at the request of the German minister, followed by the Belgian minister four days later and the Italian minister when his country entered the war. To the same end, Eyschen refused to speak ill of the German "<a href="Zollverein">Zollverein</a>", even though he had talked openly of exiting the <a href="customs%20union">customs union</a> before the war began.

On occasions, Eyschen's principles got the better of him. On 13 October 1914, a Luxembourgish journalist named Karl Dardar was arrested by the German army for publishing anti-German stories. He was then taken to <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, and tried and sentenced by <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> to three months <a href="imprisonment">imprisonment</a>. Eyschen was outraged that the Germans had kidnapped a Luxembourgish citizen and tried him for an extraterritorial offence, and Eyschen did nothing to hide his indignation. Eyschen told the German minister in Luxembourg that the action was a 'direct injury to the Grand Duchy's national sovereignty'.

Such vexatious complaints were repeated, by both Eyschen and <a href="Victor%20Thorn">Victor Thorn</a>, when a railway worker was arrested in January 1915 for allegedly working for French <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a>, and subsequently tried and sentenced in <a href="Trier">Trier</a>. As <a href="Minister%20for%20Justice">Minister for Justice</a>, Thorn was incensed that the Luxembourgish legal system had been treated with such disdain. Such objections were not received well by the German authorities. Although they tired of Eyschen's stubborn ways, he remained a useful tool to unite the various Luxembourgish political factions. On 23 June 1915 a letter was sent to the Luxembourg government stating that the Germans considered Luxembourg to be a theatre of war and that the population, therefore, was subject to military law.

Eyschen was not alone in letting his principles obstruct government business. In the summer of 1915, Eyschen pushed to further reduce the role of the Catholic Church in the <a href="state%20school">state school</a> system. Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde objected. A fervently religious Catholic (as was most of the country, but not her late father, who was <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>), she was reputed to have said, "I will not allow their most precious heritage [Roman Catholicism] to be stolen while I have the key." Marie-Adélaïde refused to budge, inviting Eyschen to resign if he could not accept her decision. Eyschen nearly did, but decided to control himself. Nevertheless, he would not be long in the job.

On 11 October 1915, Luxembourg's political system was brought to its knees by the death of Paul Eyschen. When war broke out, Eyschen had been 73 years old, but his premiership of 27 years was the only government that most Luxembourgers had known. Throughout the first year of German occupation, he had been a rock for the Luxembourgish people. He had also been of great importance to Marie-Adélaïde; the Grand Duchess had never been groomed for the position, was 53 years Eyschen's junior, and was considered both politically naïve and dangerously partisan for a <a href="constitutional%20monarch">constitutional monarch</a>. The recent strains were relatively cosmetic.

Critically, Eyschen had the <a href="Confidence%20%28political%20science%29">confidence</a> of the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Luxembourg">Chamber of Deputies</a>, and he had managed to hold together a government containing all major factions, seemingly by force of personality alone. To make matters worse for national unity, the strain of occupation had broken apart the pre-war <a href="anti-clericalism">anti-clericalist</a> alliance between the socialist and the liberal factions, thus depriving both the clericalists and anti-clericalists of a legislative <a href="majority">majority</a>. The Catholic <a href="conservatism">conservatives</a> formed the largest bloc, but they were least likely to form a majority <a href="coalition">coalition</a>.

The day after Eyschen's death, Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde invited <a href="Mathias%20Mongenast">Mathias Mongenast</a>, who had been Minister for Finance since 1882, to form a minority government. Mongenast's special status as a '<a href="caretaker%20government%23Caretakers">caretaker</a>' Prime Minister is underlined by his official title; he was not '<a href="President">President of the Government</a>', as all other Prime Ministers since 1857 had been, but held the lesser title of '<a href="President%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Ministers">President of the Council</a>'.

Mongenast's administration was never intended to be long-lived, and Marie-Adélaïde's main objective when appointing the experienced Mongenast was to steady the ship. Nevertheless, nobody expected the government to fall as soon as it did. On 4 November 1915, Mongenast nominated a new candidate for head of Luxembourg's "<a href="Normal%20school">école normale</a>". The nomination did not meet with Grand Ducal approval, and Marie-Adélaïde rejected him. Mongenast persisted; education had been a hobby horse of his, and he imagined that the Grand Duchess would accept the advice of a minister as experienced as he was. He was wrong; the Grand Duchess had always been single-minded, and resented a minority Prime Minister, particularly one so new to the job, making demands of her. The next day, Mongenast resigned, just 25 days after being given the job.

Having fought with Mongenast, the Grand Duchess decided to appoint an all-conservative cabinet led by <a href="Hubert%20Loutsch">Hubert Loutsch</a>. The Chamber of Deputies was steadfastly opposed; the <a href="Party%20of%20the%20Right%20%28Luxembourg%29">Party of the Right</a> held only 20 seats out of 52, but they formed the <a href="Plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a>. Marie-Adélaïde sought to end this deadlock by <a href="Dissolution%20of%20parliament">dissolving</a> the Chamber of Deputies and by calling for the voters to grant a mandate to the conservatives. This outraged the left, which assumed that its deputies alone had the constitutional right to grant the government confidence; it was dubbed by those on the left a 'coup d'état by the Grand Duchess'. Nonetheless, on 23 December 1915, Luxembourg went to the polls. Although the position of the Party of the Right was improved, taking 25 seats, it fell a whisker short of winning an absolute majority. On 11 January 1916, the Chamber of Deputies passed a <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">motion of no confidence</a>, and Loutsch resigned.

After the failure of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, <a href="Victor%20Thorn">Victor Thorn</a>, to form a new government. After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments had come and gone in three months, and the Luxembourgish people were becoming disillusioned with the failure of the politicians. Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, and he made a direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: "If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, it is imperative that all parties support this government." This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this. The resulting <a href="grand%20coalition">grand coalition</a> cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Kauffmann">Léon Kauffmann</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Lefort">Antoine Lefort</a>, the socialist leader <a href="Michel%20Welter">Dr Michel Welter</a>, and the liberal <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Moutrier">Léon Moutrier</a>.

The most pressing concern of the Luxembourgish government was that of food supply. The war had made importation of food an impossibility, and the needs of the German occupiers inevitably came before those of the Luxembourgish people. To slow the food supply's diminishment, Michel Welter, the Director-General for both agriculture and commerce, banned the export of food from Luxembourg. Furthermore, the government introduced <a href="rationing">rationing</a> and <a href="price%20controls">price controls</a> to counteract the soaring demand and to make food more affordable for poorer Luxembourgers. However, the measures did not have the desired effect. Increasing numbers of Luxembourgers turned to the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>, and, to the consternation of the Luxembourgish government, the German army of occupation seemed to do little to help. Moreover, the government accused Germany of aiding the development of the black market by refusing to enforce regulations, and even of smuggling goods themselves.

Through 1916, the food crisis deepened, compounded by a poor potato harvest across all of the Low Countries; in neighbouring Belgium, the harvest was between 30% and 40% down on the previous year. Although many Luxembourgers were on near-<a href="starvation">starvation</a> level dietary intakes, the country managed to avoid <a href="famine">famine</a>. In part, this was due to a reduction of German soldiers' dependence upon local food sources, instead relying on imports from Germany.

Despite the avoidance of a famine, the Luxembourgish government lost much of the faith placed in it by the public and by the politicians. On 22 December 1916, Michel Welter, the minister responsible, was censured by the Chamber of Deputies, which demanded his resignation. Thorn procrastinated, seeking any option but firing the leader of one of three major parties, but could find none. On 3 January 1917, Welter was fired, and replaced by another socialist, <a href="Ernest%20Lecl%C3%A8re">Ernest Leclère</a>. Even after the change and von Tessmar's promise of his soldiers' better conduct in future, Léon Kauffmann was capable of citing thirty-six instances of German soldiers caught smuggling foodstuffs between March 1917 and June 1918.

Discontent amongst the population grew constantly, particularly in the country's industrialised south. The autumn of 1916 had seen the first <a href="unionisation">unionisation</a> within the iron and steel industries, with trade unions springing up in both Luxembourg City and <a href="Esch-sur-Alzette">Esch-sur-Alzette</a>. Despite the war demand, iron production had slumped, leading to greater employment insecurity. In March and April, three <a href="independent%20%28politician%29">independents</a> were elected as deputies from the canton of <a href="Esch-sur-Alzette%20%28canton%29">Esch-sur-Alzette</a>, where the economy was dominated by iron and steel. As independents, these newly elected deputies were the only legislative <a href="Opposition%20%28parliamentary%29">opposition</a> to the National Union Government.

For many Luxembourgers, particularly the miners, expression of disgust at the government could not be directed through the ballot box alone. Sensing the threat of civil disobedience or worse, von Tessmar threatened any individual committing an act of violence (in which he included strike action) with the death penalty. However, on 31 May 1917, the workers sought to use their most potent weapon, by defying von Tessmar's ultimatum and downing tools. Germany was dependent upon Luxembourgish iron, as the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s naval <a href="blockade">blockade</a> forced Germany to look to accessible local supplies; in 1916, Luxembourg produced over one-seventh of the Zollverein's <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a>. As such, Germany simply could not afford a strike, lest it be deprived of critical raw materials.

In putting down the strike, von Tessmar was ruthlessly efficient, but he was not required to resort to the executions that he had threatened. Within nine days, the strike was defeated and the leaders arrested. The two ringleaders were then sentenced by German court-martial in <a href="Trier">Trier</a> to ten years imprisonment, to the disgust of the government. The continued refusal of the German authorities to respect the Luxembourgish government, and the humiliating manner in which the strike was put down by German military muscle rather than the Luxembourgish <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a>, were too much for Thorn. On 19 June 1917, the government resigned.

Although the experiment in grand coalition had failed, the need for some political unity remained. As the National Union Government was collapsing, Kauffmann arranged an alliance between his Party of the Right and Moutrier's <a href="Liberal%20League%20%28Luxembourg%29">Liberal League</a>, seeking to achieve change that would outlive the occupation. The primary objective was to address the perennial grievances of the left by amending the constitution; in November 1917, the Chamber of Deputies launched a wide-ranging series of debates on various amendments to the constitutions. Ultimately, the constitution was amended to prohibit the government from entering into <a href="secret%20treaty">secret treaties</a>, to improve deputies' pay (hitherto set at just 5 <a href="Luxembourgian%20franc">francs</a> a day), to introduce <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, and to change the <a href="Plurality%20voting%20system">plurality</a> <a href="voting%20system">voting system</a> to a <a href="Proportional%20representation">proportional</a> one.

Whereas all of the above measures were broadly popular, across most of the political spectrum, the same was not true of the proposal to amend Article 32. Said article had not been amended in the overhaul of 1868, and its text had remained unchanged since the original constitution of 1848, stating unequivocally that all <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> resided in the person of the Grand Duchess. For some, particularly those that resented the close relations between Marie-Adélaïde and the German royalty, the idea of national sovereignty residing in such a person was unacceptable. The Chamber of Deputies voted to review Article 32, but Kauffmann refused to allow it, seeing the redefinition of the source of national sovereignty as covert <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>.

The summer of 1918 saw a dramatic decline in the fortunes of the government. On 8 July, <a href="Clausen%2C%20Luxembourg">Clausen</a>, in central Luxembourg City, had been bombed by the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, killing ten civilians. Although this did not endear the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> to Luxembourgers, the Grand Duchess' instinct was to run to the Germans, who were even less popular amongst the people. On 16 August, German Chancellor <a href="Georg%20von%20Hertling">Georg von Hertling</a> paid a visit to Luxembourg; although Hertling asked only to see the Grand Duchess, Kauffmann asked that he also attend. To the Luxembourgish people, relations between the two countries now seemed unambiguously cordial, and all that was left of Kauffmann's credibility disappeared. This was compounded further by the news on 26 August of the <a href="engagement">engagement</a> of the Grand Duchess' sister, <a href="Princess%20Antonia%20of%20Luxembourg">Princess Antonia</a>, to <a href="Rupprecht%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Bavaria">Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria</a>, who was "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" in the German army. Pressure mounted on Kauffmann; with his party still strong, but with his personal reputation shattered, he was left with no option but to resign, which he did on 28 September in favour of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Reuter">Émile Reuter</a>, another conservative.

By the autumn of 1918, Germany's position in the war was becoming untenable. The massive <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> had been an unmitigated disaster, whereas the Allied <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a>, the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, had driven the German Army back to its own borders. On 6 November, von Tessmar announced the full withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg. Five days after von Tessmar's announcement, Germany signed an <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">armistice treaty</a>, which brought an end to the war of four years. One of the terms of the armistice involved the withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg, along with the other occupied countries.

The Allied powers agreed that the German withdrawal from Luxembourg would be observed by the United States, and that the United States would receive the honour of liberating the captive country. On 18 November, American <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing</a>, <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> (C-in-C) of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Force</a> (AEF) on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, issued a <a href="proclamation">proclamation</a> to the people of Luxembourg, stating that the United States' newly formed <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Central">Third Army</a> would move through Luxembourg to occupy the German <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, but that the Americans would come as allies and as liberators:

The following day, American soldiers crossed the Franco-Luxembourgish border. Everywhere, they were fêted as liberators, in the spirit that Pershing had intended to inspire, and were met by bands and civilians waving flags, and were adorned with flowers. <a href="Luc%20Housse">Luc Housse</a>, the <a href="Mayor%20of%20Luxembourg%20City">Mayor of Luxembourg City</a>, told the advancing American army that the Germans had, on the whole, been disciplined and well-behaved in the previous three weeks: a marked improvement upon his numerous complaints earlier in the conflict. Finally, on 22 November 1918, the German army completed its withdrawal from Luxembourg, ending its occupation.

Germany's defeat created the perfect opportunity for the Allied powers to resolve the Luxembourgish question once and for all. By removing Luxembourg from Germany's <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">sphere of influence</a>, they hoped to guarantee its continued independence, and thus preserve the peace they had won. On 19 December, at the instigation of the British and French governments, the Luxembourgish government announced its withdrawal from the "<a href="Zollverein">Zollverein</a>" and an end to the railway concessions that Luxembourg had previously granted Germany.

Although the Allies were satisfied at this remedy, at the time, the Luxembourgish government was threatened by a communist insurgency. After the retreat of the German army, revolutionaries established <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Russian</a>-influenced <a href="Workers%27%20council">Workers' council</a>s across Luxembourg. On 10 November, the day after <a href="Karl%20Liebknecht">Karl Liebknecht</a> and <a href="Rosa%20Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a> declared a similar '<a href="socialist%20republic">socialist republic</a>' in Germany, communists in <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg City</a> declared a republic, but it lasted for only a matter of hours. Another revolt took place in <a href="Esch-sur-Alzette">Esch-sur-Alzette</a> in the early hours of 11 November, but also failed. The socialists had been fired up by the behaviour of Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde, whose interventionist and obstructive streak had stymied even Eyschen. On 12 November, socialist and liberal politicians, finding their old commonality on the issue, called for her <a href="abdication">abdication</a>. A motion in the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Luxembourg">Chamber of Deputies</a> demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated by 21 votes to 19 (with 3 abstentions), but the Chamber did demand the government hold a popular <a href="referendum">referendum</a> on the issue.

Although the left's early attempts at founding a republic had failed, the underlying cause of the resentment had not been addressed, and, as long as Marie-Adélaïde was Grand Duchess, the liberals would ally themselves to the socialists in opposition to her. The French government also refused to cooperate with a government led by a so-called '<a href="Collaborationism">collaborator</a>'; French <a href="Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28France%29">Foreign Minister</a> <a href="St%C3%A9phen%20Pichon">Stéphen Pichon</a> called cooperation 'a grave compromise with the enemies of France'. More pressing than either of these troubles, on 9 January, a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of the Luxembourgish army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, with <a href="%C3%89mile%20Servais">Émile Servais</a> (the son of <a href="Emmanuel%20Servais">Emmanuel Servais</a>) as 'Chairman of the Committee of Public Safety'. However, by January, the vacuum left by the German withdrawal had been filled by American and French soldiers. <a href="President%20of%20the%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Luxembourg">President of the Chamber</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Altwies">François Altwies</a> asked French troops to intervene. Eager to put an end to what it perceived to be pro-Belgian revolutions, the French army crushed the would-be revolutionaries.

Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Adélaïde, who abdicated in favour of her sister, <a href="Charlotte%2C%20Grand%20Duchess%20of%20Luxembourg">Charlotte</a>. <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, which had hoped to either annex Luxembourg or force it into <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>, grudgingly recognised Charlotte on 13 February. The dynasty's hold on power would be tenuous until September 1919, when a referendum on the future of the Grand Duchy found 77.8% in favour of continued rule by the <a href="House%20of%20Nassau-Weilburg">House of Nassau-Weilburg</a>.

Despite the armistice ending the war, and the end of the revolts, Luxembourg's own future was still uncertain. Belgium was one of the countries hit hardest by the war; almost the whole of the country was occupied by Germany, and over 43,000 Belgians, including 30,000 civilians, had died as a result. Belgium sought compensation, and had its eye on any and all of its neighbours; in November 1918, <a href="Charles%20Hardinge%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hardinge%20of%20Penshurst">Lord Hardinge</a>, the <a href="Permanent%20Secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> at the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a>, told the Dutch ambassador in London, "The Belgians are on the make, and they want to grab whatever they can."

The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> set aside two articles (§40 and §41) to address concerns for Luxembourg's status. The main article, §40, revoked all special privileges that Germany had acquired in Luxembourg, with Germany specifically renouncing advantages gained in the treaties of 1842, 1847, 1865, 1866, February 1867, <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%2C%201867">May 1867</a>, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Frankfurt%20%281871%29">1871</a>, 1872, and 1902. The effects of these treaties' revocation were then explicitly stated; Luxembourg would withdraw from the "Zollverein", Germany would lose its right to use the Luxembourgish railways, and Germany was obligated to recognise the termination of Luxembourg's neutrality, thus validating the actions of the Luxembourgish government since the armistice. Furthermore, to prevent economic <a href="embargo">embargo</a> after the end of the customs union, the treaty allowed Luxembourg an indefinite option on German coal, and prohibited Germany from levying <a href="Customs%20%28tax%29">duty</a> on Luxembourgish exports until 1924.

Thousands of Luxembourgers overseas, unconstrained by the Luxembourgish government's need to remain neutral, signed up to serve with foreign armies. 3,700 Luxembourgish nationals served in the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a>, of whom over 2,000 died. As Luxembourg's pre-war population was only 266,000, the loss of life solely in the service of the French army amounted to almost 1 percent of the entire Luxembourgish population, relatively greater than the totals for many combatant countries (see: "<a href="World%20War%20I%20casualties">World War I casualties</a>"). The Luxembourgish volunteers are commemorated by the <a href="G%C3%ABlle%20Fra">Gëlle Fra</a> (literally " 'Golden Lady' ") <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a>, which was unveiled in Luxembourg City on 27 May 1923. The original memorial was destroyed on 20 October 1940, during the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Luxembourg%20in%20World%20War%20II">Nazi occupation</a>, as it symbolised the rejection of German identity and active resistance against <a href="Germanisation">Germanisation</a>. After World War II, it was gradually rebuilt, culminating in its second unveiling, on 23 June 1985.

The <a href="Luxembourg%20American">Luxembourgish community</a> in the United States found itself confronted by a <a href="Identity%20crisis%20%28psychology%29">crisis of identity</a>. Traditionally, they had identified themselves as ethnically German, rather than as a separate community of their own. As such, they read German language newspapers, attended German schools, and lived amongst <a href="German%20American">German American</a>s. Nonetheless, when it became apparent that the war would not be over quickly, the opinions of Luxembourg Americans changed; on 2 May 1915, the Luxemburger Brotherhood of America's annual convention decided to adopt English as its only official language. Other organisations were less inclined to change their ways; the "Luxemburger Gazette" opposed <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s supposed 'favouritism' towards the United Kingdom as late in the war as 1917. However, when the United States entered the war in April of that year, the wavering members of the community supported the Allies, changing forever the relationship between the German and Luxembourgish communities in the US.

Hrithik Roshan

Hrithik Roshan (, born 10 January 1974) is an Indian actor who appears in <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> films. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Hrithik%20Roshan">many awards</a>, including six <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfares</a>, four for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> and one each for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Debut">Best Debut</a> and <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor (Critics)</a>. Starting in 2012, he appeared in "<a href="Forbes%20India">Forbes India</a>" <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> based on his income and popularity.

Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success "<a href="Kaho%20Naa...%20Pyaar%20Hai">Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai</a>" (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama "<a href="Fiza">Fiza</a>" and the 2001 ensemble melodrama "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.

The 2003 science fiction film "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>", for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his career; he also appeared in its sequels: "<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>" (2006) and "<a href="Krrish%203">Krrish 3</a>" (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film "<a href="Dhoom%202">Dhoom 2</a>", <a href="Mughal%20emperors">Mughal</a> emperor <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a> in the 2008 historical romance "<a href="Jodhaa%20Akbar">Jodhaa Akbar</a>" and a <a href="Tetraplegia">quadriplegic</a> in the 2010 drama "<a href="Guzaarish%20%282010%20film%29">Guzaarish</a>". He played the lead in the 2011 drama "<a href="Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</a>", the 2012 revenge film "<a href="Agneepath%20%282012%20film%29">Agneepath</a>", the 2014 action comedy "<a href="Bang%20Bang%21">Bang Bang!</a>", which ranks among the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian films</a>, and the revenge thriller "<a href="Kaabil">Kaabil</a>" (2017) in which he played a blind man.

Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with "<a href="Just%20Dance%20%28Indian%20TV%20series%29">Just Dance</a>" (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to <a href="Sussanne%20Khan">Sussanne Khan</a>, with whom he has two children.

Roshan was born on 10 January 1974 in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> to a <a href="Punjabis">Punjabi</a> family prominent in Bollywood. His father, film director <a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>, is the son of music director <a href="Roshan%20%28music%20director%29">Roshanlal Nagrath</a>; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director <a href="J.%20Om%20Prakash">J. Om Prakash</a>. His uncle, <a href="Rajesh%20Roshan">Rajesh</a>, is a music composer. Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the <a href="Bombay%20Scottish%20School%2C%20Mahim">Bombay Scottish School</a>. Roshan is of part <a href="Bengalis">Bengali</a> ancestry from his paternal grandmother's side. Although Roshan practices <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, he says that "I'm not religious. I don't visit temples. But I hope there is a superpower."
Roshan felt isolated as a child; he was born with <a href="Polydactyly">an extra thumb</a> <a href="Syndactyly">fused</a> to the one on his right hand, which led some of his peers to avoid him. He has stammered since the age of six; this caused him problems at school, and he feigned injury and illness to avoid oral tests. He was helped by daily speech therapy.

Roshan's grandfather, Prakash first brought him on-screen at the age of six in the film "<a href="Aasha%20%281980%20film%29">Aasha</a>" (1980); he danced in a song enacted by <a href="Jeetendra">Jeetendra</a>, for which Prakash paid him 100. Roshan made uncredited appearances in various family film projects, including his father's production "<a href="Aap%20Ke%20Deewane">Aap Ke Deewane</a>" (1980). In Prakash's "<a href="Aas%20Paas">Aas Paas</a>" (1981), he appeared in the song "Shehar Main Charcha Hai". The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's "<a href="Bhagwaan%20Dada">Bhagwaan Dada</a>" (1986). Roshan decided that he wanted to be a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies. In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with <a href="scoliosis">scoliosis</a> that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated, he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse effects. Roshan sees this day as "the turning point of [his] life."

Roshan attended <a href="Sydenham%20College">Sydenham College</a>, where he took part in dance and music festivals while studying, graduating in commerce. Roshan assisted his father on four films—"<a href="Khudgarz">Khudgarz</a>" (1987), "<a href="King%20Uncle">King Uncle</a>" (1993), "<a href="Karan%20Arjun">Karan Arjun</a>" (1995) and "<a href="Koyla">Koyla</a>" (1997)—while also sweeping the floor and making tea for the crew. After pack-up, Roshan would enact <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>'s scenes from "Koyla" and film himself to make a judgement about his performance as an actor. While he assisted his father, he studied acting under <a href="Kishore%20Namit%20Kapoor">Kishore Namit Kapoor</a>.

Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a> in the cancelled film <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a>'s "Tara Rum Pum Pum". Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama "<a href="Kaho%20Naa...%20Pyaar%20Hai">Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai</a>" (2000) opposite another debutante, <a href="Ameesha%20Patel">Ameesha Patel</a>. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">NRI</a> who falls in love with Patel's character. To prepare, he trained with the actor <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> to bulk up physically, worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding. With global revenues of , "Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai" became the <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%202000">highest-grossing Indian film</a> of 2000. His performance was acclaimed by critics; Suggu Kanchana on <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> wrote, "[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film ... He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to." For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, <a href="IIFA%20Awards">IIFA Awards</a>, and <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Awards">Zee Cine Awards</a>. He became the first actor to win both Filmfare <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Debut">Best Debut</a> and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> awards the same year. The film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood. The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time.

In his second release, <a href="Khalid%20Mohammed">Khalid Mohammed</a>'s crime drama "<a href="Fiza">Fiza</a>", Roshan played Amaan, an innocent Muslim boy who becomes a terrorist after the <a href="Bombay%20riots">1992–93 Bombay riots</a>. Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor. Co-starring <a href="Karisma%20Kapoor">Karisma Kapoor</a> and <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>, "Fiza" was moderately successful at the box office, and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his "body language, his diction, his expressions, [and] his overall persona." Roshan next appeared in <a href="Vidhu%20Vinod%20Chopra">Vidhu Vinod Chopra</a>'s action drama "<a href="Mission%20Kashmir">Mission Kashmir</a>" (2000) alongside <a href="Sanjay%20Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a>, Preity Zinta, and <a href="Jackie%20Shroff">Jackie Shroff</a>. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20wars%20and%20conflicts">Indo-Pakistani conflicts</a>, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success. Roshan was drawn to his complex role of a young man traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been responsible for the death of his entire birth family. In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan "brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits."
In 2001, Roshan appeared in two films, the first of which was <a href="Subhash%20Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>'s "<a href="Yaadein%20%282001%20film%29">Yaadein</a>", a romantic drama which paired him with <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> and reunited him with Shroff. Although highly anticipated, "Yaadein" was reviled by critics; in "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", Ziya Us Salam criticised the director for relying on Roshan's commercial appeal. Roshan next had a supporting role in <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a>'s ensemble melodrama "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" alongside <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a> and Kareena Kapoor. He was cast as Rohan Raichand—the younger son of Bachchan's character who plots to reunite him with his adopted son (played by Khan)—after Johar had watched a <a href="rough%20cut">rough cut</a> of "Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai". "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..." finished as India's second highest-grossing film of the year, and among the most successful Bollywood films in the overseas market, earning over worldwide. Writing for Rediff.com, Anjum N described Roshan as "the surprise scene-stealer", praising him for holding his own against the established actors. Roshan received a nomination for the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> for his performance.

In 2002 <a href="Vikram%20Bhatt">Vikram Bhatt</a>'s romance "<a href="Aap%20Mujhe%20Achche%20Lagne%20Lage">Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage</a>" reunited him with Ameesha Patel but failed at the box office, as did <a href="Arjun%20Sablok">Arjun Sablok</a>'s romance "<a href="Na%20Tum%20Jaano%20Na%20Hum">Na Tum Jaano Na Hum</a>" (2002). Roshan's final role that year was in a <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> production, the high-profile "<a href="Mujhse%20Dosti%20Karoge%21">Mujhse Dosti Karoge!</a>" co-starring <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a> and Kareena Kapoor. The romantic drama was heavily promoted before its release and made money internationally, though not in India. In another commercial failure, <a href="Sooraj%20R.%20Barjatya">Sooraj R. Barjatya</a>'s "<a href="Main%20Prem%20Ki%20Diwani%20Hoon">Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon</a>", Roshan was cast alongside Kareena Kapoor for the fourth time, and <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>. The press labeled Roshan a "one-trick pony" and suggested that the failure of these films would end his career.

Roshan's career began to revive with a starring role in "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>" (2003). The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a <a href="Developmental%20disability">developmentally disabled</a> young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being—a role that required him to lose nearly . Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: "I could live my childhood [again]. I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me." In the book "Film Sequels", <a href="Carolyn%20Jess-Cooke">Carolyn Jess-Cooke</a> drew similarities between the character and <a href="Forrest%20Gump%20%28character%29">Forrest Gump</a>, portrayed by <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> in <a href="Forrest%20Gump">the titular film</a>, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on their view of the film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>"—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" noted "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn." A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary." "Koi... Mil Gaya" was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning , and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor (Critics)</a>.
The following year, Roshan collaborated with Amitabh Bachchan and Preity Zinta on <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>'s "<a href="Lakshya%20%28film%29">Lakshya</a>" (2004), a fictionalised <a href="coming-of-age%20story">coming-of-age story</a> set against events from the 1999 <a href="Kargil%20War">Kargil War</a>. He also featured in the <a href="item%20number">item number</a> "<a href="Main%20Aisa%20Kyun%20Hoon">Main Aisa Kyun Hoon</a>" (choreographed by <a href="Prabhu%20Deva">Prabhu Deva</a>) which proved popular with audiences. The film earned Roshan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare and <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Male">Zee Cine</a> ceremony. Manish Gajjar of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> praised Roshan's versatility and his transformation from a carefree youth to a determined and courageous soldier.

Roshan was not seen on screen again until 2006, with three new releases, including a cameo at the end of the year in the romance "<a href="I%20See%20You%20%28film%29">I See You</a>". He co-starred with <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a> and <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> in his father's superhero production "<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>". A follow-up to his family's production "Koi... Mil Gaya", it saw him play dual roles—the title superhero and his character from the original film. Before production, Roshan traveled to China to train with <a href="Tony%20Ching">Tony Ching</a> for the cable work that would be needed to make his character fly. He sustained several injuries during production. For example, he tore the hamstring in his right leg and broke his thumb and toe. "Krrish" became the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006 with a worldwide revenue of . It garnered him Best Actor awards at the 2007 <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen</a> and the International Indian Film Academy Awards. Ronnie Scheib of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" considered Roshan a prime asset of the film, noting that he "pulls off the pic's wilder absurdities with considerable panache."

For his role as an enigmatic master thief in "<a href="Dhoom%202">Dhoom 2</a>" (2006)—an action sequel co-starring <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a>, <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a> and Abhishek Bachchan—Roshan won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film critic <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> called him "the heart, the soul, and the spirit of the film", and praised his stunts, concluding that he "holds the film together and even manages to take your attention away from its many flaws." Bored by playing the "good guy", Roshan was excited to play a villain for the first time. At the request of the film's producer <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a>, Roshan lost for the role, and learned skateboarding, snow boarding, rollerblading and sand surfing. With earnings of , "Dhoom 2" became the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian film of all time</a>, a distinction it held for two years. In the 2007 melodrama "<a href="Om%20Shanti%20Om">Om Shanti Om</a>", he made a cameo alongside several Bollywood stars.

In 2008, Roshan was cast in <a href="Ashutosh%20Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a>'s "<a href="Jodhaa%20Akbar">Jodhaa Akbar</a>", a partly fictionalised account of a <a href="marriage%20of%20convenience">marriage of convenience</a> between the <a href="Mughal%20emperor">Mughal emperor</a> <a href="Akbar">Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar</a> (played by Roshan) and the Rajput princess <a href="Mariam-uz-Zamani">Jodha Bai</a> (played by Rai). Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required to play the role of a king. For the role, Roshan learned sword-fighting and horse-riding, and also took <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> lessons. "Jodhaa Akbar" earned worldwide. Roshan's performance earned him his fourth <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Actor%20Award">Filmfare Best Actor Award</a> as well as his first international award –"Best Actor" at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival in <a href="Kazan">Kazan</a>, Russia. Critics were generally appreciative of Roshan's performance. <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> of Rediff.com thought that Roshan "proves a very good Akbar. There are times when his inflection seems too modern, but the actor gives the performance his all, slipping into the skin of the character and staying there." Roshan ended 2008 with an appearance in the popular item number "Krazzy 4" from the <a href="Krazzy%204">film of same name</a>.

Following a small role in <a href="Zoya%20Akhtar">Zoya Akhtar</a>'s "<a href="Luck%20by%20Chance">Luck by Chance</a>" in 2009, Roshan starred in and recorded "Kites in the Sky" for the multi-national romantic thriller "<a href="Kites%20%28film%29">Kites</a>" (2010). In the film, produced by his father, he played a man running a <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">green card</a> scam in Las Vegas in which he has married 11 different women in exchange for money. "Kites" opened on a record-breaking 3000 screens, and became the first Bollywood film to break into the North American top 10. However, the film eventually underperformed at India's box office and received negative reviews from critics. The website <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> attributed this failure to its multilingual dialogues. In a review for Rediff.com, Matthew Schneeberger thought that Roshan "overacts. A lot. In "Kites", he nails a few scenes, but bungles many more, particularly the film's catastrophically bad ending."

Roshan then collaborated with director <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a> on the drama "<a href="Guzaarish%20%282010%20film%29">Guzaarish</a>" (2010) in which he had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from <a href="quadriplegia">quadriplegia</a>, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a>. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with <a href="paraplegic">paraplegic</a> patients. In his own words, "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for <a href="Zee%20News">Zee News</a> praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes." Roshan received the <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Male">Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics)</a> and nominations for Filmfare, <a href="IIFA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">IIFA</a> and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.

In 2011, Roshan appeared in Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama "<a href="Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</a>" alongside <a href="Abhay%20Deol">Abhay Deol</a> and Farhan Akhtar as three friends who embark on a bachelor trip where they overcome their insecurities. Zoya cast Roshan in the role of an uptight <a href="workaholic">workaholic</a> as she considers him her favourite actor. For <a href="Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara%20%28soundtrack%29">the film's soundtrack</a>, Roshan recorded the song "<a href="Se%C3%B1orita%20%28Farhan%20Akhtar%2C%20Hrithik%20Roshan%2C%20Abhay%20Deol%20and%20Maria%20del%20Mar%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20song%29">Señorita</a>" with his co-stars and <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20del%20Mar%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">María del Mar Fernández</a>. "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" was released to positive reviews and Roshan's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, "Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity that you make the inward journey with his character." The film grossed worldwide and became Roshan's first commercial success in three years. He was nominated for another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Later that year, he made a special appearance in Farhan's "<a href="Don%202">Don 2</a>".

Roshan's only screen appearance in 2012 was in <a href="Karan%20Malhotra">Karan Malhotra</a>'s "<a href="Agneepath%20%282012%20film%29">Agneepath</a>", a retelling of the <a href="Agneepath%20%281990%20film%29">1990 film of the same name</a>. Cast alongside <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a>, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, Roshan reinterpreted the character <a href="Vijay%20Deenanath%20Chauhan">Vijay Deenanath Chauhan</a> (originally played by Amitabh Bachchan), a common man who seeks revenge against an unscrupulous man for framing and murdering his father. Roshan was initially skeptical of taking up a role earlier played by Bachchan, and thought hard before accepting. He did not watch the original film for inspiration as he found his role to be completely different. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Roshan suffered a painful back injury. He deemed "Agneepath" "the hardest [project] I've ever worked in my life" owing to the exhaustion he felt while filming. The film broke Bollywood's highest <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films%23Opening%20day%20nett%20gross">opening-day earnings</a> record, and had a worldwide gross of . A "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" reviewer thought Roshan "breathes fire and soul into "Agneepath"". The actor was rewarded with another Filmfare nomination and a third consecutive <a href="Stardust%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Drama">Stardust Award for Best Actor in a Drama</a>, having won previously for "Guzaarish" and "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara".

Roshan appeared in the third instalment of the <a href="Krrish%20%28franchise%29">"Krrish" film series</a>—"<a href="Krrish%203">Krrish 3</a>" (2013) which also starred Priyanka Chopra, <a href="Vivek%20Oberoi">Vivek Oberoi</a> and <a href="Kangana%20Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a>. During production, Roshan was injured when he fell down, which resulted in back pain. Critics thought that the film was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Roshan's performance garnered praise. The editor <a href="Komal%20Nahta">Komal Nahta</a> lauded Roshan for playing three different characters in the film, and the actor received his eleventh Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. "Krrish 3" grossed worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.
Roshan received a fourth consecutive Filmfare nomination for his performance in the 2014 action comedy "<a href="Bang%20Bang%21">Bang Bang!</a>", a remake of the 2010 Hollywood release "<a href="Knight%20and%20Day">Knight and Day</a>" and <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20Indian%20films">one of the most expensive Bollywood films</a>. Playing the role of an eccentric secret agent who plots to track down a terrorist, Roshan became the first actor to perform a <a href="flyboard">flyboard</a>ing stunt in film. While filming in Thailand, Roshan suffered a head injury from a stunt accident and underwent <a href="Neurosurgery">brain surgery</a> to relieve a chronic <a href="subdural%20hematoma">subdural hematoma</a>. The critic Mohar Basu noted that Roshan was "pitch perfect" and "breez[ed] through his part brilliantly." The film earned in global ticket sales, making it among the highest-grossing Indian films.

For playing the role of a farmer in 2016 BC who travels to <a href="Mohenjo-daro">Mohenjo-daro</a> in Ashutosh Gowariker's "<a href="Mohenjo%20Daro%20%28film%29">Mohenjo Daro</a>" (2016), Roshan was paid , a record-breaking remuneration for an Indian actor. He underwent a three-month training to achieve the "lithe" and "agile" physique required for his role. Despite being a highly anticipated release, it failed commercially, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Dismissing the film as an "unintentional comedy", <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> wrote that Roshan "pours his soul into every scene. But the burden of carrying this leaden, cartoon-like narrative proves too much even for his Herculean shoulders." Roshan was next seen alongside <a href="Yami%20Gautam">Yami Gautam</a> in <a href="Sanjay%20Gupta%20%28director%29">Sanjay Gupta</a>'s "<a href="Kaabil">Kaabil</a>" (2017), a romantic thriller about a blind man who avenges the rape of his blind wife.

Roshan set up a charity foundation in 2009 that aims to work for handicapped people.

In 2013, he took part in a festivity at <a href="Ghatkopar">Ghatkopar</a>, whose proceeds went to an <a href="NGO">NGO</a> supporting tribal girls suffering from malnutrition and starvation. Also that year, he donated to help the victims of the <a href="2013%20North%20India%20floods">2013 North India floods</a>.

Alongside other Bollywood stars, Roshan played a football match for charity organised by <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>'s daughter, Ira, in 2014. The following year, he appeared with <a href="Sonam%20Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a> in the music video for "<a href="Dheere%20Dheere">Dheere Dheere</a>", whose profits were donated to charity. Later that year, Roshan became the Indian brand ambassador for <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> and the Global Goals campaign's World's Largest Lesson that aims to educate children in over 100 countries about the <a href="Sustainable%20Development%20Goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>.

Following his debut film, Roshan signed on for endorsement deals with <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, Tamarind and <a href="Hero%20Honda">Hero Honda</a>, all for three years and for at least . As of 2010, he is celebrity endorser for such brands and products as <a href="Provogue">Provogue</a>, Parle Hide and Seek, <a href="Reliance%20Communications">Reliance Communications</a> and Hero Honda and recently roshan has completed six years with Rado."The Times of India" reported that Roshan received to for each endorsement, making him one of the highest-paid male celebrity endorsers.

On 20 December 2000, Roshan married <a href="Sussanne%20Khan">Sussanne Khan</a> in a private ceremony in Bangalore. Despite their religious difference—Roshan is a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> and Khan is a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>—Roshan says that he equally valued her beliefs. The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008). They separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014.

Roshan and Sussanne maintained that they parted amicably. In 2016, he filed a lawsuit against his "Krrish 3" co-star <a href="Kangana%20Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a>, accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover up their affair. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.

Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in 2000. Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a <a href="Star%20Plus">Star Plus</a> interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence. Nepalese people threatened to "bury [him] alive" if he ever visited the country. Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan "did not touch upon Nepal." The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country. Nepali actress <a href="Manisha%20Koirala">Manisha Koirala</a> helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station.

As the son of the filmmaker Rakesh, Roshan faced the media spotlight from a young age. Discussing <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media as one of the most talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming "Mohenjo Daro" despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara", remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.
Roshan intentionally takes on diverse parts in an attempt to not be <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a>. He looks at the scripts as a platform to inspire with the strength and courage of his characters and to make his audiences smile. Roshan was noted by critics for his versatility in portraying a variety of characters in "Koi... Mil Gaya" (2003), "Lakshya" (2004), "Jodhaa Akbar" (2008), and "Guzaarish" (2010). Box Office India ranked him first on its top actors listing in 2000 and later included him in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Roshan topped Rediff.com's list of best Bollywood actors in 2003, and was ranked fourth in 2006. "Filmfare" magazine included two of his performances—from "Koi... Mil Gaya" and "Lakshya"—on its 2010 list of 80 Iconic Performances. In March 2011, Roshan placed fourth on Rediff.com's list of Top 10 Actors of 2000–2010. Roshan's dancing ability has also drawn praise from the media, an opinion he disagrees with. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" finds him to be "a sensational dancer" who "has the dashing, chiseled looks of a silent movie matinee idol." Some critics also believe that he is only able to dance and act in his father's films. His inclination towards "glamorous, albeit empty parts", which conform to character stereotypes, has been criticised. Roshan's rise has been charted in a series of interviews and articles by the UK based journalist Fuad Omar. In his book, "Bollywood: An Insider's Guide", Omar criticised the flippant press treatment of Roshan which heralded him as the next superstar one moment and declared his career over the next.

Roshan is among Bollywood's highest-paid actors. In a 2014 article "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" credited him as "the most bankable star" in Bollywood. One of the most high-profile Indian celebrities, he was named the second most powerful Indian film star by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" in 2001. He ranked fourth in "Filmfare" Power List in 2007. In a 2009 poll conducted by "Daily News and Analysis" Roshan was voted one of India's most popular icons. At the 2009 <a href="FICCI">FICCI</a>-IIFA Awards, Roshan was one of the ten recipients of the most powerful Bollywood entertainers of the 2000s. From 2012–2018, Roshan was placed on "<a href="Forbes%20India">Forbes India</a>" <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a>—a list based on the income and popularity of Indian celebrities—peaking at ninth position in 2014 with an annual income of .

Roshan has established himself as a sex symbol and a style icon in India. In 2006, Roshan was one of the four Bollywood actors, along with Priyanka Chopra, Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of "Bollywood Legends". He topped "The Times of India" listing of 50 Most Desirable Men in 2010 and ranked among the top five for the next five years. In 2010 and 2012, the Indian edition of "<a href="GQ%20%28Indian%20edition%29">GQ</a>" included him in their listing of Bollywood's best dressed men. A life-size, wax figure of him was installed at London's <a href="Madame%20Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a> museum in January 2011, making him the fifth Indian actor to have been replicated as a wax statue there. Versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in New York, Washington and other cities in the world. Roshan regularly features in the magazine "<a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a>" listing of the 50 Sexiest Asian Men. He topped the list in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and featured among the top five in 2010, 2013 and 2015 to 2018.

Andrea Doria-class battleship

The Andrea Doria" class (usually called Caio Duilio" class in Italian sources) was a pair of <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Navy">Royal Italian Navy</a> ("Regia Marina") between 1912 and 1916. The two ships—<a href="Italian%20battleship%20Andrea%20Doria">"Andrea Doria"</a> and <a href="Italian%20battleship%20Caio%20Duilio">"Caio Duilio"</a>—were completed during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The class was an incremental improvement over the preceding . Like the earlier ships, "Andrea Doria" and "Caio Duilio" were armed with a main battery of thirteen guns.

The two ships were based in southern Italy during World War I to help ensure that the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a>'s surface fleet would be contained in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>. Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and were involved in several international incidents, including at <a href="Corfu%20Incident">Corfu in 1923</a>. In 1933, both ships were placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a>. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring out the rest of the guns to , strengthening their armor protection, installing new <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boilers</a> and <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The two ships were moored in <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> on the night of 11/12 November 1940 when the British launched a carrier strike on the Italian fleet. In the resulting <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Battle of Taranto</a>, "Caio Duilio" was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking. "Andrea Doria" was undamaged in the raid; repairs for "Caio Duilio" lasted until May 1941. Both ships escorted convoys to North Africa in late 1941, including Operation M42, where "Andrea Doria" saw action at the inconclusive <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> on 17 December. Fuel shortages curtailed further activities in 1942 and 1943, and both ships were interned at <a href="Malta">Malta</a> following Italy's surrender in September 1943. Italy was permitted to retain both battleships after the war, and they alternated as fleet <a href="flagship">flagship</a> until the early 1950s, when they were removed from active service. Both ships were <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> after 1956.

The "Andrea Doria"-class ships were designed by <a href="naval%20architect">naval architect</a> <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> ("Generale del Genio navale") <a href="Giuseppe%20Valsecchi">Giuseppe Valsecchi</a> and were ordered in response to French plans to build the s. The design of the preceding s was generally satisfactory and was adopted with some minor changes. These mostly concerned the reduction of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> by shortening the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> deck, the consequent lowering of the <a href="amidships">amidships</a> <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a> and the upgrading of the <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> to sixteen guns in lieu of the eighteen guns of the older ships.

The ships of the "Andrea Doria" class were <a href="length%20at%20the%20waterline">long at the waterline</a>, and <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>. They had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . They displaced at normal load, and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. They were provided with a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>. The ships had two <a href="rudder">rudder</a>s, both on the centerline. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.

The ships were fitted with three <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, arranged in three engine rooms. The center engine room housed one set of turbines that drove the two inner <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s. It was flanked by compartments on either side, each housing one turbine set powering the outer shafts. Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s, 8 of which burned oil and 12 of which burned coal sprayed with oil. Designed to reach a maximum speed of from , neither of the ships reached this goal on their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, only achieving speeds of . The ships could store a maximum of of coal and of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that gave them a range of at .

As built, the ships' main armament comprised thirteen 46-<a href="Caliber%23Caliber%20as%20measurement%20of%20length">caliber</a> <a href="305%20mm%20/46%20Model%201909">305-millimeter guns</a>, designed by <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a>, in five gun turrets. The turrets were all on the centerline, with a twin-gun turret <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> over a triple-gun turret in fore and aft pairs, and a third triple turret amidships, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The turrets had an elevation capability of −5 to +20 degrees and the ships could carry 88 <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> for each gun. Sources disagree regarding these guns' performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini says that they fired <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing (AP)</a> projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of , which gave a maximum range of .

The secondary armament on the two ships consisted of sixteen 45-caliber <a href="Cannone%20da%20152/45">guns</a>, also designed by Armstrong Whitworth, mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the sides of the hull underneath the main guns. Their positions tended to be wet in heavy seas, especially the rear guns. These guns could depress to −5 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +20 degrees; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. They could fire a high-explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships carried 3,440 rounds for them. For defense against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, the ships carried nineteen 50-caliber <a href="QF%2014%20pounder%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20I%20%26amp%3B%20II%20naval%20gun">guns</a>; they could be mounted in 39 different positions, including on the turret roofs and upper decks. These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns, and their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute. They fired a AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships were also fitted with three submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a> and the third in the stern.

The "Andrea Doria"-class ships had a complete <a href="waterline">waterline</a> armor belt with a maximum thickness of that reduced to towards the stern and towards the bow. Above the main belt was a <a href="strake">strake</a> of armor thick that extended up to the lower edge of the main deck. Above this strake was a thinner one, 130 millimeters thick, that protected the casemates. The ships had two armored <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decks</a>: the main deck was thick in two layers on the flat that increased to on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The second deck was thick, also in two layers. Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the belt to the decks.

The frontal protection of the <a href="gun%20turrets">gun turrets</a> was in thickness with thick sides, and an roof and rear. Their <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s had armor above the deck that reduced to between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had walls thick; those of the aft conning tower were thick.

During World War I, a pair of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>, one gun at the bow and the other on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of low-angle 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new <a href="Cannon%2076/40%20Model%201916">40-caliber 76-millimeter guns</a> were installed abreast the aft <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>. Two <a href="license-built">license-built</a> <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">2-pounder</a> AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s were upgraded and a fixed <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a <a href="Macchi%20M.18">Macchi M.18</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>.

By the early 1930s, the "Regia Marina" had begun design work on the new s, but it recognized that they would not be complete for some time. As a stop-gap measure in response to the new French s, the navy decided to modernize its old battleships; work on the two surviving "Conte di Cavour"s began in 1933 and the two "Andrea Doria"s followed in 1937. The work lasted until July 1940 for "Duilio" and October 1940 for "Andrea Doria". The existing bow was dismantled and a new, longer, bow section was built, which increased their overall length by to (on the "Cavour"-class the new bow had been grafted over the existing one, instead). Their beam increased to and their draft at deep load increased to . The changes made during their reconstruction increased their displacement to for "Andrea Doria" and for "Duilio" at deep load. The ships' crews increased to 70 officers and 1,450 enlisted men.

Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two sets of Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at . The boilers were replaced by eight <a href="superheated">superheated</a> Yarrow boilers. On their sea trials the ships reached a speed of , although their maximum speed was about in service. The ships now carried of fuel oil, which provided them with a range of at a speed of .

The center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed and all of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen guns in four triple-gun turrets and ten <a href="Cannone%20da%2090/53%23Naval%20version"></a> AA guns in single turrets. In addition the ships were fitted with fifteen 54-caliber <a href="Societ%C3%A0%20Italiana%20Ernesto%20Breda">Breda</a> <a href="Cannone-Mitragliera%20da%2037/54%20%28Breda%29"></a> light AA guns in six twin-gun and three single mounts and sixteen <a href="Breda%20Model%2035">Breda Model 35</a> AA guns, also in twin mounts. The 305-millimeter guns were bored out to 320 millimeters (12.6 in) and their turrets were modified to use electric power. They had a fixed loading angle of +12 degrees, but there is uncertainty on their new maximum elevation, with some sources citing a maximum value of +27 degrees, while others claim one of +30 degrees. The 320-millimeter AP shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of . In early 1942 the rearmost 20-millimeter mounts were replaced by twin 37-millimeter gun mounts and the 20-millimeter guns were moved to the roof of Turret 'B', while the RPC motors from the stabilized mounts of the 90 mm guns were removed. The forward superstructure was rebuilt with a new forward conning tower, protected with thick armor. Atop the conning tower there was a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> fitted with three large <a href="rangefinders">rangefinders</a>.

The deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of . The armor protecting the secondary turrets was thick. The existing underwater protection was replaced by the <a href="Pugliese%20torpedo%20defense%20system">Pugliese system</a> that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo <a href="warhead">warhead</a>.

These modernizations have been criticized by some naval historians because these ships would eventually prove to be inferior to the British battleships they were meant to face (namely the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Class%20battleship">"Queen Elizabeth"-class</a>, since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely). In addition, the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new "Littorio"-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays in the construction of the modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.

Both battleships were completed after Italy entered World War I on the side of the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a>, though neither saw action, since Italy's principal naval opponent, the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a>, largely remained in port for the duration of the war. Admiral <a href="Paolo%20Thaon%20di%20Revel">Paolo Thaon di Revel</a>, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and minelayers could operate effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the <a href="MAS%20%28boat%29">MAS torpedo boats</a>, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.

"Andrea Doria" and "Caio Duilio" both cruised in the eastern Mediterranean after the war, and both were involved in postwar disputes over control of various cities. "Caio Duilio" was sent to provide a show of force during a dispute over control of <a href="%C4%B0zmir">İzmir</a> in April 1919 and "Andrea Doria" assisted in the suppression of <a href="Gabriele%20D%27Annunzio">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a>'s <a href="Italian%20Regency%20of%20Carnaro">seizure of Fiume</a> in November 1920. "Caio Duilio" cruised the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> after the İzmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by the battleship <a href="Italian%20battleship%20Giulio%20Cesare">"Giulio Cesare"</a>. "Andrea Doria" and "Caio Duilio" were present during the <a href="Corfu%20incident">Corfu incident</a> in 1923 as part of the naval demonstration protesting the murder of General <a href="Enrico%20Tellini">Enrico Tellini</a> and four other Italians. In January 1925, "Andrea Doria" visited <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Portugal, to represent Italy during the celebration marking the 400th anniversary of the death of explorer <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>. The two ships performed the normal routine of peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout the 1920s and early 1930s; both were placed in reserve in 1933.

Both "Andrea Doria" and "Caio Duilio" went into drydock in the late 1930s for extensive modernizations; this work lasted until October and April 1940, respectively. By that time, Italy had entered World War II on the side of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. The two ships joined the 5th Division based at <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a>. "Caio Duilio" participated in a patrol intended to catch the British battleship and a convoy bound for <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, but neither target was found. She and "Andrea Doria" were present during the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">attack on Taranto</a> on the night of 11/12 November 1940. A force of twenty-one <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo-bomber">torpedo-bomber</a>s, launched from , attacked the ships moored in the harbor. "Andrea Doria" was undamaged in the raid, but "Caio Duilio" was hit by a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> on her starboard side. She was grounded to prevent her from sinking in the harbor and temporary repairs were effected to allow her to travel to <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> for permanent repairs, which began in January 1941. In February, <a href="Operation%20Grog">she was attacked</a> by the British <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>; several warships attempted to shell "Caio Duilio" while she was in dock, but they scored no hits. Repair work lasted until May 1941, when she rejoined the fleet at Taranto.

In the meantime, "Andrea Doria" participated in several operations intended to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean, including the <a href="Operation%20Excess">Operation Excess</a> convoys in January 1941. By the end of the year, both battleships were tasked with escorting convoys from Italy to North Africa to support the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">Italian and German forces fighting there</a>. These convoys included Operation M41 on 13 December and Operation M42 on 17–19 December. During the latter, "Andrea Doria" and "Giulio Cesare" engaged British cruisers and destroyers in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> on the first day of the operation. Neither the Italians nor the British pressed their attacks and the battle ended inconclusively. "Caio Duilio" was assigned to distant support for the operation, and was too far away to actively participate in the battle. Convoy escort work continued into early 1942, but thereafter the fleet began to suffer from a severe shortage of fuel, which kept the ships in port for the next two years. "Caio Duilio" sailed away from Taranto on 14 February with a pair of <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s and seven destroyers in order to intercept the British convoy MW 9, bounded from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to Malta, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. After learning of "Caio Duilio" departure, however, British escorts scuttled the transport "Rowallan Castle", previously disabled by German aircraft.

Both ships were interned at Malta following <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Italy's surrender</a> on 3 September 1943. They remained there until 1944, when the Allies allowed them to return to Italian ports; "Andrea Doria" went to <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, and "Caio Duilio" returned to Taranto before joining her sister at Syracuse. Italy was allowed to retain the two ships after the end of the war, and they alternated in the role of fleet flagship until 1953, when they were both removed from service. "Andrea Doria" carried on as a gunnery training ship, but "Caio Duilio" was placed in reserve. Both battleships were stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a> in September 1956 and were subsequently broken up for scrap.

Jethro Sumner

Jethro Exum Sumner ( 1733 – March 18, 1785) was a North Carolina landowner and businessman, and an officer in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Born in <a href="Virginia%20Colony">Virginia Colony</a>, Sumner's military service began in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> as a member of the state's Provincial forces. After the conclusion of that conflict, he moved to <a href="Bute%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bute County</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">Province of North Carolina</a> where he acquired a substantial area of land and operated a tavern. He served as <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">Sheriff</a> of Bute County, but with the coming of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, he became a strident <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a>, and was elected to North Carolina's <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">Provincial Congress</a>.

Sumner was named the commanding officer of the <a href="3rd%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">3rd North Carolina Regiment</a> of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Line">North Carolina Line</a>, a formation of the Continental Army, in 1776, and served in both the Southern theater and Philadelphia campaign. He was one of five brigadier generals from North Carolina in the Continental Army, in which capacity he served between 1779 and 1783. He served with distinction in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Stono%20Ferry">Stono Ferry</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Eutaw%20Springs">Eutaw Springs</a>, but recurring bouts of poor health often forced him to play an administrative role, or to convalesce in North Carolina. Following a drastic reduction in the number of North Carolinians serving with the Continental Army, Sumner became a general in the state's militia but resigned in protest after the North Carolina Board of War awarded overall command of the militia to <a href="William%20Smallwood">William Smallwood</a>, a Continental Army general from Maryland. After the end of the war in 1783, Sumner helped to establish the North Carolina Chapter of the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>, and became its first president. He died in 1785 with extensive landholdings and 35 slaves.

Sumner was born in <a href="Nansemond%20County%2C%20Virginia">Nansemond County, Virginia</a>, in 1733 to Jethro and Margaret Sullivan Sumner. His family had originally settled in Nansemond County in 1691. 

Between 1758 and 1761, during the French and Indian War, he was a lieutenant in the Virginia Provincial forces in Pennsylvania under the command of <a href="William%20Byrd%20III">William Byrd III</a>. On November 25, 1758, Sumner participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Duquesne%23French%20retreat">capture</a> of <a href="Fort%20Duquesne">Fort Duquesne</a>. He was made commander at Pennsylvania's <a href="Fort%20Bedford">Fort Bedford</a> in 1760. 

After his regiment was disbanded in 1761, he returned home to Nansemond County. Between 1761 and 1764, he moved to <a href="Bute%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bute County</a> in <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and married Mary Hurst of <a href="Granville%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Granville County</a>, with whom he would have three children. One daughter, Mary, went on to wed <a href="Thomas%20Blount%20%28statesman%29">Thomas Blount</a>, who would later serve multiple terms in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>.

Sumner owned substantial property inherited through his wife's family in Bute County, where he also owned and possibly operated a tavern on land that he leased for £36 annually. Like many former Virginians who moved across the border into North Carolina during the colonial era, it is likely that Sumner would have retained close business ties with the province of his birth. 

Between 1772 and 1776, he served as sheriff of Bute County, resigning when he became an officer during the American Revolutionary War. Sumner was active in pre-Revolution protests and politics, as he believed a separation from Great Britain was inevitable.

In 1775, the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> passed legislation to raise militia forces throughout the state, and to that end it organized six militia districts, including one, centered on the town of <a href="Halifax%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax</a>, which contained Sumner's home. 

The soldiers comprising the militia throughout the state were to enlist for six-month periods. Sumner was chosen to be a major in the Halifax District militia, and was instructed to drill his men so that they would be prepared for the expected conflict. Between August and September 1775, he served as Bute County's representative at the Third North Provincial Congress. In November 1775, Sumner summoned his militia into active service, and marched north to join <a href="Robert%20Howe%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Howe</a> in capturing (and later <a href="Burning%20of%20Norfolk">burning</a>) <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>.

On April 4, 1776, after the American Revolutionary war had been raging in Massachusetts for nearly a year, the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">Provincial Congress</a> at Halifax chose Sumner to be colonel, and thus commanding officer, of the <a href="3rd%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">3rd North Carolina Regiment</a>. He likely participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sullivan%27s%20Island">defense of Charleston</a> against a British invasion attempt in 1776, after which he was involved in the aborted plans of Major General <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a> to invade <a href="History%20of%20Florida%23British%20rule">British Florida</a>. During the planning stages for the Florida invasion, Sumner disagreed with <a href="Peter%20Muhlenberg">Peter Muhlenberg</a> of the <a href="8th%20Virginia%20Regiment">8th Virginia Regiment</a> over which of the two was to be given command over Lee's Virginia and North Carolina troops while the commanding general was traveling in advance of his men. This dispute was resolved only when a military court of inquiry awarded Muhlenberg temporary command after Sumner failed to appear and plead his case. By August 18, 1776, Sumner's 3rd Regiment had reached <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, where they joined Lee, who had arrived earlier in the month. The planned invasion of Florida did not materialize, though, and Sumner left his regiment at Savannah in September 1776 to recruit more soldiers from North Carolina.

In early 1777, Sumner resumed command of the 3rd North Carolina regiment, and marched the unit north to serve under <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in the <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign">Philadelphia campaign</a>. In early and mid-1777, he remained encamped with the main portion of the Continental Army at <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>. He and his men drilled regularly and had their supplies and arms inspected and repaired, although many of the North Carolinians had such poor muskets that a substantial number were discarded. Sumner and his regiment fought in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Brandywine</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Germantown</a>, and spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 in <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a> with Washington's army.

After the death at Germantown of General <a href="Francis%20Nash">Francis Nash</a>, the regiments of his North Carolina brigade were left without a commanding general. Generals <a href="Alexander%20McDougall">Alexander McDougall</a> of New York and <a href="Lachlan%20McIntosh">Lachlan McIntosh</a> of Georgia were appointed in succession to temporary command of the North Carolinians while in winter quarters. Many North Carolina officers believed the state was due the appointment of two additional brigadier generals based on the number of soldiers it provided to the Continental Army. At Valley Forge, the North Carolina brigade had a total strength of 1,051, but 353 were ill, and 164 lacked sufficient clothes to be fit for service. Sumner himself became ill in early 1778, and was forced to return home to recuperate; he continued to recruit soldiers in North Carolina during his recovery. Despite his recruitment efforts, in February 1778, North Carolina's regiments were consolidated because of a lack of available soldiers, and Sumner's 3rd Regiment absorbed the <a href="5th%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">5th North Carolina Regiment</a>.

Although North Carolina believed it was owed additional general officer positions, conflicts between members of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a> over who was to be considered for the positions stalled the appointment of officers to assume those positions. <a href="Thomas%20Burke%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Thomas Burke</a>, one of North Carolina's leading delegates to the Continental Congress, apparently lacked interest in any of the suggested candidates. To complicate matters further, <a href="Alexander%20Martin">Alexander Martin</a>, once a leading candidate for generalship, resigned after charges of cowardice were leveled against him, and was no longer seen as an appropriate candidate. The General Assembly deferred discussion of possible replacement generals for more than a month after convening on November 7, 1777. By December 15, the North Carolina General Assembly instructed its representatives in the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> to nominate Sumner for promotion to general. It was not until January 9, 1779, though, that the Continental Congress commissioned Sumner as brigadier general (along with fellow North Carolinian <a href="James%20Hogun">James Hogun</a>), and ordered him to join General <a href="Benjamin%20Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a> in South Carolina. Sumner received the highest number of congressional votes, thirteen to Hogun's nine and <a href="Thomas%20Clark%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Thomas Clark</a>'s four.

On June 20, 1779, Sumner led a Continental Army brigade at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stono%20Ferry">Battle of Stono Ferry</a>, assaulting the British right <a href="flanking%20maneuver">flank</a> and routing the <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessian</a> <a href="Musketeer%20Regiment%20von%20Tr%C3%BCmbach">von Trümbach Regiment</a>. The Continentals and the <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> militia began to run out of ammunition during the battle, and Lincoln was forced to order a general retreat. At least seven Continental officers under Sumner's command were wounded, and future United States President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s brother Hugh was among ten North Carolinians killed. After the engagement at Stono Ferry, Sumner experienced another bout of poor health. He returned to North Carolina to recover, continuing to recruit troops during his convalescence. He suffered financially during his recovery, as a monetary crisis at the time left many officers in his position barely able to support themselves at home. He was also tasked by Lincoln with finding deserters in North Carolina and pressing them back into service. Sumner was on a leave of absence in September and October 1779, during the Patriot defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Savannah">Siege of Savannah</a>.

Between the <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">Siege of Charleston</a> in May 1780 and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Battle of Camden</a> in August that year, the North Carolina Line (a loose organizational structure that encompassed all of North Carolina's Continental Army units) was virtually annihilated, suffering substantial casualties and the loss of many men as prisoners of war. During at least part of the intervening time, Sumner was in North Carolina on a recruiting mission. Rather than rebuild the Line, the North Carolina General Assembly determined to rely on militia for the defense of the state. In September 1780, Sumner temporarily transferred to command of the <a href="Hillsborough%20District%20militia">Hillsborough District militia</a>, under the statewide leadership of <a href="Richard%20Caswell">Richard Caswell</a>. As commander of a brigade of North Carolina militia, Sumner was tasked with defending the state from the advances of British General <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a>, but the militiamen were poorly equipped and ill-trained.

In late 1780, the North Carolina Board of War removed Caswell from command of North Carolina's militia, and the General Assembly awarded command of the militia to Continental Army Brigadier General <a href="William%20Smallwood">William Smallwood</a> of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, citing the Assembly's lack of confidence in their own state's military commanders. Sumner was further offended when command of the dwindling number of North Carolina Continentals in the southern theater was given to Smallwood as well. Despite persistent urging from Alexander Martin and others, Sumner resigned from his militia command in October 1780, and returned to the Continental service. A political backlash by prominent militia commanders like Caswell and Martin and their supporters led to the abolition of the Board of War by the General Assembly soon after Sumner's resignation, and Caswell in particular came back to power on the Board's replacement organ, called the "Council Extraordinary".

Sumner next served under General <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>, who arrived in the southern theater in December 1780 and directed Sumner to recruit further Continental soldiers from North Carolina. On June 2, 1781, Greene ordered Sumner to join him in South Carolina, which he did along with 350 new recruits on August 1. Despite the passage of a <a href="Conscription">draft</a> law in North Carolina, the number of men under his command fluctuated from day to day because of both temporary and permanent desertions. These desertions eventually elicited his personal apology to Greene, as Sumner felt unable to control the ebb of soldiers in camp. On September 8, his regiments were positioned on the right flank of the Continental Army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Eutaw%20Springs">Battle of Eutaw Springs</a>, where his units served a vital role in halting several British assaults. Greene commented on the North Carolinians' actions at Eutaw Springs, stating that they "fought with a degree of obstinacy that would do honor to the best of veterans".

Following his success at Eutaw Springs, Sumner was made commanding officer of Continental Army forces in North Carolina by Greene in 1781. Greene primarily wanted him to regain control of the military situation in the state, as then-Governor and former Continental Congress delegate Thomas Burke had been captured by <a href="David%20Fanning%20%28loyalist%29">David Fanning</a> in a stunning daylight raid on <a href="Hillsborough%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hillsborough, North Carolina</a> on September 12, 1781. Combat between the British and Continental armies effectively ceased in late 1781. After that point, Sumner failed to make any reports to Greene, who remained his commanding officer, for several months at a time, partly because of Sumner's recurring bouts of illness.

Following the war's end in 1783, Sumner returned to Bute County, which had been renamed <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Warren County</a> after <a href="Joseph%20Warren">Joseph Warren</a>, the hero of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>. It appears that Sumner's wife died at some point between 1781 and 1785. For his service in the Continental Army, he received a land warrant on October 23, 1783, which represented compensation for 84 months of service. Sumner helped create North Carolina's chapter of the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a> in October 1783, and served as its first president.

Sumner died in Warren County between March 15 and March 19, 1785, at the age of 52. At his death, he owned of land in North Carolina and Tennessee (much of which in the latter was part of the Continental Army land warrant he received), as well as 35 slaves. He was originally buried outside of Warrenton, but in 1891 his remains were moved to the <a href="Guilford%20Courthouse%20National%20Military%20Park">Guilford Courthouse Battlefield</a>, where they were interred under a monument intended as part of a "shrine to patriots". In March 2012, a driver struck Sumner's monument after going off-road to avoid hitting a deer, nearly destroying the stone structure. The monument was restored by May 2012, and Sumner was reburied in a public ceremony. <a href="Sumner%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Sumner County, Tennessee</a>, originally in the western portion of North Carolina, was named for him, although Sumner never visited the county.

1906 French Grand Prix

The 1906 Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, commonly known as the 1906 French Grand Prix, was a <a href="Motorsport">motor race</a> held on 26 and 27 June 1906, on closed public roads outside the city of <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>. The Grand Prix was organised by the <a href="Automobile%20Club%20de%20France">Automobile Club de France</a> (ACF) at the prompting of the French <a href="Automotive%20industry">automobile industry</a> as an alternative to the <a href="Gordon%20Bennett%20Cup%20%28auto%20racing%29">Gordon Bennett races</a>, which limited each competing country's number of entries regardless of the size of its industry. France had the largest automobile industry in Europe at the time, and in an attempt to better reflect this the Grand Prix had no limit to the number of entries by any particular country. The ACF chose a circuit, composed primarily of dust roads sealed with <a href="tar">tar</a>, which would be lapped six times on both days by each competitor, a combined race distance of . Lasting for more than 12 hours overall, the race was won by <a href="Ferenc%20Szisz">Ferenc Szisz</a> driving for the <a href="Renault">Renault</a> team. <a href="Fiat">FIAT</a> driver <a href="Felice%20Nazzaro">Felice Nazzaro</a> finished second, and <a href="Albert%20Cl%C3%A9ment">Albert Clément</a> was third in a <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment-Bayard">Clément-Bayard</a>.

<a href="Paul%20Baras">Paul Baras</a> of <a href="Brasier">Brasier</a> set the <a href="fastest%20lap">fastest lap</a> of the race on his first lap. He held on to the lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, defending it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer <a href="Michelin">Michelin</a> introduced a detachable <a href="Rim%20%28wheel%29">rim</a> with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.

Renault's victory contributed to an increase in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the race has become known as the first Grand Prix. The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the <a href="1907%20French%20Grand%20Prix">following year</a>, and the German automobile industry to organise the <a href="Kaiserpreis">Kaiserpreis</a>, the forerunner to the <a href="German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, in 1907.

The first <a href="French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a> originated from the <a href="Gordon%20Bennett%20Cup%20in%20auto%20racing">Gordon Bennett races</a>, established by American millionaire <a href="James%20Gordon%20Bennett%2C%20Jr.">James Gordon Bennett, Jr.</a> in 1900. Intended to encourage <a href="Automotive%20industry">automobile industries</a> through sport, by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become some of the most prestigious in Europe; their formula of closed-road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns, over open roads. Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country, and the winning country earned the right to organise the next race. Entries were limited to three per country, which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers, they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority. Instead, the rule put them on a numerical level footing with countries such as Switzerland, with only one manufacturer, and allowed <a href="Mercedes%20%28car%29">Mercedes</a>, which had factories in Germany and Austria, to field six entries: three from each country. The French <a href="Sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>, the <a href="Automobile%20Club%20de%20France">Automobile Club de France</a> (ACF), held trials between its manufacturers before each race; in 1904 twenty-nine entries competed for the three positions on offer.

When <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Th%C3%A9ry">Léon Théry</a> won the 1904 race for the French manufacturer <a href="Richard-Brasier">Richard-Brasier</a>, the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify the format of the 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation. The ACF accepted the proposal, but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation, the limits would remain but would be determined by the size of each country's industry. Under the ACF's proposal, France was allowed fifteen entries, Germany and Britain six, and the remaining countries—Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the United States—three cars each.

The French proposal was met with strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations, and at the instigation of Germany a meeting of the bodies was organised to settle the dispute. Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race, to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race. But when Théry and Richard-Brasier won again in 1905, and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell once more to the ACF, the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement, the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France.

A combined offer from the city council of <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> and local hoteliers to contribute funding to the Grand Prix persuaded the ACF to hold the race on the outskirts of the city, where the <a href="Automobile%20Club%20de%20la%20Sarthe">Automobile Club de la Sarthe</a> devised a circuit. Running through farmlands and forests, the track, like most circuits of the time, formed a triangle. It started outside the village of <a href="Montfort-le-Gesnois">Montfort</a>, and headed south-west towards Le Mans. Competitors then took the Fourche <a href="Hairpin%20turn">hairpin</a>, which turned sharply left and slowed the cars to around , and then an essentially straight road through <a href="Bouloire">Bouloire</a> south-east towards <a href="Saint-Calais">Saint-Calais</a>. The town was bypassed with a temporary wooden <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a>, as the track headed north on the next leg of the triangle. Another plank road through a forest to a minor road allowed the track to bypass most of the town of <a href="Vibraye">Vibraye</a>, before it again headed north to the outskirts of <a href="La%20Fert%C3%A9-Bernard">La Ferté-Bernard</a>. A series of left-hand turns took competitors back south-west towards Montfort on the last leg of the triangle, a straight broken by a more technical winding section, near the town of <a href="Connerr%C3%A9">Connerré</a>. Competitors lapped the circuit twelve times over two days, six times on each day, a total distance of .

To address concerns about previous races, during which spectators crowding too close to the track had been killed or injured by cars, the ACF erected of <a href="palisade">palisade</a> fencing around the circuit, concentrated around towns and villages, and at the ends of lanes, footpaths and roads intersecting the track. The planking used to avoid the towns of Saint-Calais and Vibraye was installed as an alternative to the system used in the Gordon Bennett races, where cars passing through towns would slow down to a set speed and were forbidden to overtake. Several <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a>s were erected over the track, and a 2,000-seat canopied <a href="grandstand">grandstand</a> was built at the start and finish line at Montfort. This faced the <a href="Pit%20stop">pit lane</a> on the other side of the track, where the teams were based and could work on the cars. A tunnel under the track connected the grandstand and the pit lane. The road surface was little more than compacted dust and sharp stones which could be easily kicked up by the cars, and to limit the resulting problem of impaired visibility and punctures the ACF sealed the entire length of the track with tar. More was added to the bends of the track after cars running on them during practice broke up the surface.

Ten French manufacturers entered cars in the Grand Prix: <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment-Bayard">Clément-Bayard</a>, <a href="Hotchkiss%20et%20Cie">Hotchkiss</a>, <a href="Gobron-Brilli%C3%A9">Gobron-Brillié</a>, <a href="Automobiles%20Darracq%20France">Darracq</a>, <a href="Vulpes%20%28car%29">Vulpes</a>, <a href="Brasier">Brasier</a> (the successor to Richard-Brasier), <a href="Panhard">Panhard</a>, <a href="Automobiles%20Gr%C3%A9goire">Grégoire</a>, <a href="Lorraine-Dietrich">Lorraine-Dietrich</a> and <a href="Renault">Renault</a>. Two teams came from Italy (<a href="Fiat">FIAT</a> and <a href="Itala">Itala</a>) and one (Mercedes) from Germany. With the exceptions of Gobron-Brillié and Vulpes, which each entered one car, and Grégoire, which entered two cars, each team entered three cars, to make a total field of thirty-four entries. No British or American manufacturers entered the Grand Prix. The British were suspicious that the event was designed as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> for the French automobile industry; British magazine "<a href="The%20Motor">The Motor</a>" quoted French daily newspaper "<a href="Le%20Petit%20Parisien">Le Petit Parisien</a>" as evidence of this supposed lack of <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a>.

The ACF imposed a maximum weight limit—excluding tools, <a href="upholstery">upholstery</a>, <a href="Wing%20%28automotive%29">wings</a>, lights and light fittings—of , with an additional allowed for a <a href="ignition%20magneto">magneto</a> or <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a> to be used for <a href="Ignition%20system">ignition</a>. Regulations limited <a href="Fuel%20economy%20in%20automobiles">fuel consumption</a> to . Every team opted for a magneto system; all used a low-tension system except Clément-Bayard, Panhard, Hotchkiss, Gobron-Brillié, and Renault, which used high-tension. Mercedes, Brasier, Clément-Bayard, FIAT and Gobron-Brillié used a <a href="chain%20drive">chain drive</a> system for transmission; the rest used <a href="drive%20shaft">drive shaft</a>s. All entries were fitted with four-cylinder engines; <a href="engine%20displacement">engine displacement</a> ranged from for the Grégoire to for the Panhard. <a href="Exhaust%20system">Exhaust pipes</a> were directed upwards to limit the dust kicked up off the roads. Teams were allowed to change drivers and equipment, but only at the end of the first day's running, not while the race was in progress.

<a href="Michelin">Michelin</a>, <a href="Dunlop%20Rubber">Dunlop</a> and <a href="Continental%20AG">Continental</a> supplied tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's one major technical innovation, Michelin introduced the "jante amovible": a detachable <a href="Rim%20%28wheel%29">rim</a> with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto the car in the event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his <a href="riding%20mechanic">riding mechanic</a> were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife, and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars. As carrying each rim added to the weight of the car over conventional wheels and tyres, some teams—such as Itala and Panhard—could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit.

The Grand Prix name ("Great Prize") referred to the prize of 45,000 <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a>s to the race winner. The franc was pegged to the gold at 0.290 grams per franc, which meant that the prize was worth 13 kg of gold.

Roads around the track were closed to the public at 5 am on the morning of the race. A draw took place among the thirteen teams to determine the starting order, and assign each team a number. Each of a team's three entries was assigned a letter, one of "A", "B", or "C". Two lines of cars formed behind the start line at Montfort: cars marked "A" in one line and cars marked "B" in the other. Cars assigned the letter "C" were the last away; they formed a single line at the side of the track so that any cars which had completed their first circuit of the track would be able to pass. Cars were dispatched at 90-second intervals, beginning at 6 am. Lorraine-Dietrich driver <a href="Fernand%20Gabriel">Fernand Gabriel</a> (numbered "1A") was scheduled to be the first competitor to start, but he <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalled</a> on the line and could not restart his car before the FIAT of <a href="Vincenzo%20Lancia">Vincenzo Lancia</a>, who was next in line, drove away. Renault's lead driver, the Hungarian <a href="Ferenc%20Szisz">Ferenc Szisz</a>, started next, and behind him <a href="Victor%20H%C3%A9mery">Victor Hémery</a> of Darracq, <a href="Paul%20Baras">Paul Baras</a> of Brasier, <a href="Camille%20Jenatzy">Camille Jenatzy</a> of Mercedes, <a href="Louis%20Rigolly">Louis Rigolly</a> of Gobron-Brillié and <a href="Alessandro%20Cagno">Alessandro Cagno</a> of Itala. Philippe Tavenaux of Grégoire, scheduled next, was unable to start; the only other non-starter was the sole Vulpes of Marius Barriaux, which was withdrawn before the race when it was found to be over the weight limit. The last of the thirty-two starters—the Clément-Bayard of "de la Touloubre", numbered "13C"—left the start line at 6:49:30 am.

Itala driver Maurice Fabry started the fastest of the competitors; he covered the first kilometre in 43.4 seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52 minutes and 25.4 seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position on the road and into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.

FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott climbed from fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car rolled off the planks outside Vibraye. Szisz maintained the lead he had gained on lap three to finish the first day just before noon in a time of 5 hours, 45 minutes and 30.4 seconds (5:45:30.4), 26 minutes ahead of <a href="Albert%20Cl%C3%A9ment">Albert Clément</a> of Clément-Bayard. Despite a slow start, FIAT driver <a href="Felice%20Nazzaro">Felice Nazzaro</a> moved up to third position, 15 minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; <a href="Henri%20Rougier">Henri Rougier's</a> Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into <a href="parc%20ferm%C3%A9">parc fermé</a>, a <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlit</a> area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.

The time each car set on the first day determined the time they set off on the second day, hence Szisz's first-day time of 5 hours and 45 minutes meant he started at 5:45 am. Following the same principle, Clément began at 6:11 am and Nazzaro at 6:26 am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings. A horse, which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an engine starting, towed each competitor out of parc fermé to the start line. As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day's running, Szisz and Clément began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars. Clément completed his stop more quickly than Szisz, and Nazzaro did not stop at all, and so Clément closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on Clément. Jenatzy and Lancia, who were both suffering eye problems from the first day, had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers. As planned, "Burton" took over Jenatzy's car, but Lancia was forced to resume in his street clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start.

Hotchkiss driver <a href="Elliott%20Shepard">Elliott Shepard</a>, who finished the first day in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car at the start of the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered <a href="Radiator%20%28engine%20cooling%29">radiator</a> damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.

Szisz's Renault suffered a broken rear <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a> on the tenth lap, but his lead was so great (more than 30 minutes) that he could afford to drive cautiously with the damage. He took the black flag of the winner at the finish line after a combined total from the two days of 12:12:07.0; he had also been quicker on the straight than any other driver, reaching a top speed of . He finished 32 minutes ahead of second-placed Nazzaro, who was in turn 3 minutes ahead of Clément. Jules Barillier's Brasier was fourth, ahead of Lancia and Panhard driver <a href="George%20Heath%20%28racing%20driver%29">George Heath</a>. Baras—whose first lap was the fastest of any car during the race—was seventh, ahead of <a href="Arthur%20Duray">Arthur Duray</a> of Lorraine-Dietrich, "Pierry" of Brasier, and "Burton". The last finisher, the Mercedes driver "Mariaux", was eleventh, more than four hours behind Szisz. Rougier, who had set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 53:16.4, had retired on lap ten after a long series of punctures. Of the other retirements, Hémery, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Hanriot">René Hanriot</a> (riding mechanic <a href="Jean%20Chassagne">Jean Chassagne</a>) and <a href="Louis%20Wagner%20%28driver%29">Louis Wagner</a> of Darracq suffered engine problems; the radiators on the cars of Rigolly of Gobron-Brillié, Xavier Civelli de Bosch of Grégoire and Cagno of Itala failed; <a href="Pierre%20de%20Caters">Pierre de Caters</a> of Itala, Shepard and <a href="Hubert%20Le%20Blon">Hubert Le Blon</a> of Hotchkiss, A. Villemain of Clément-Bayard and <a href="Vincenzo%20Florio">Vincenzo Florio</a> of Mercedes withdrew after wheel failures; Gabriel of Lorraine-Dietrich, "de la Touloubre" of Clément-Bayard and Henri Tart of Panhard retired because of other mechanical problems; and Fabry of Itala, Weilschott of FIAT, Teste of Panhard, Richez of Renault and Jacques Salleron of Hotchkiss suffered crash damage. Edmond of Renault was the only competitor whose retirement was the result of driver injury.
The top three finishers were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies. In an interview after the race, Szisz reflected on the "anxiety" he had felt as he drove the final laps: "I feared something small which would take away victory at the moment when it had seemed to be won." The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600 cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.

Reflections on the race by the organisers and the media generally concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant that there had been very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's detachable rims. Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have the rims, and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the <a href="1907%20French%20Grand%20Prix">following year</a>. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the <a href="German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, the <a href="Kaiserpreis">Kaiserpreis</a> (<a href="Kaiser">Kaiser's</a> Prize) was raced in 1907.

The conference held in 1904 to consider the French proposal for a change in formula to the Gordon Bennett races led to the formation of the <a href="Association%20Internationale%20des%20Automobile%20Clubs%20Reconnus">Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus</a> (AIACR; the predecessor of the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a>), the body responsible for regulating international motorsport. Although a smaller race held in 1901 had awarded the "<a href="Pau%20Grand%20Prix">Grand Prix de Pau</a>", the 1906 race outside Le Mans was the first genuinely international race to carry the label "Grand Prix". Until the First World War it was the only annual race to be called a Grand Prix (often, "the" Grand Prix), and is commonly known as "the first Grand Prix".

Interstate 75 in Michigan

Interstate 75 (I-75) is a part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> that runs north–south from <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, to <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula">Upper Peninsula</a> of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. I-75 enters the state from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> in the south, north of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a> and runs generally northward through <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a> and <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a>, crosses the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a>, and ends at the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a> in Sault Ste. Marie. The freeway runs for approximately on both of Michigan's major peninsulas. The landscapes traversed by I-75 include <a href="Southern%20Michigan">Southern Michigan</a> farmland, northern forests, suburban bedroom communities, and the urban core of Detroit. The freeway also uses three of the state's monumental bridges to cross major bodies of water. There are four <a href="auxiliary%20Interstates">auxiliary Interstates</a> in the state related to I-75, as well as nine current or former <a href="Business%20routes%20of%20Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">business routes</a>, with either Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur I-75 (BS I-75) designations.

The freeway bears several names in addition to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the Detroit–Toledo Expressway during planning in the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the Fisher Freeway or the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway, named for pioneers in the auto industry. Sections on either side of the Mackinac Bridge are the G. Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway, named for politicians who helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the American Legion Memorial Highway, after the <a href="American%20Legion">organization of the same name</a>. Various sections carry components of the four <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s in the state.

Several <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails spanned the state along the general path of the modern freeway. After statehood, several of these were converted into <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a>s that later became some of the first state highways. In the 1920s, five of these were added to the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a>: <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 2</a> (US 2), <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a>, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a>. In the 1950s, a Michigan Turnpike was proposed as a <a href="toll%20road">tolled</a>, <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a> in the Lower Peninsula. After passage of the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal Highway Act of 1956</a>, this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned. Construction started in 1957, signs went up in 1959, and I-75 was completed in 1973. Since completion, the freeway has been upgraded with the construction of the <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a> near Saginaw and improved connections to the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a> in Detroit.

Known as "Michigan's Main Street", I-75 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> (NHS) for its entire length. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway is the busiest in the state: between <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-8</a> (Davison Highway) and McNichols Road in Detroit approximately 194,300 vehicles used the freeway on <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average each day</a> in 2010; in contrast the lowest traffic level was 3,208 vehicles between the <a href="M-48%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-48</a> and <a href="M-80%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-80</a> interchanges in <a href="Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Chippewa County</a>. I-75 carries segments of all four <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s in the state. It is also the only highway located on both Michigan's <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower</a> peninsulas (UP and LP, respectively). Between the Ohio state line and <a href="Kawkawlin%2C%20Michigan">Kawkawlin</a>, I-75 contains between a minimum of six and a maximum of ten lanes total; other sections vary between four and six lanes in total.

Crossing the state line north of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a>, I-75 enters Michigan in <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan">Monroe County</a> carrying the <a href="Lake%20Erie%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Erie Circle Tour</a> (LECT) near the North Maumee Bay of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>. The freeway runs parallel to the shoreline of the Great Lake and past the community of <a href="Luna%20Pier%2C%20Michigan">Luna Pier</a>. Further north, I-75 passes to the southeast of <a href="Monroe%2C%20Michigan">Monroe</a> and crosses the <a href="River%20Raisin">River Raisin</a> between the city and the river mouth. North of the river, the freeway turns further inland running through farmland. Near <a href="Newport%2C%20Michigan">Newport</a>, <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> splits off to the northwest and I-75 continues its northeasterly trek through Monroe County. When it crosses the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a>, the trunkline enters <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a> between <a href="South%20Rockwood%2C%20Michigan">South Rockwood</a> and <a href="Rockwood%2C%20Michigan">Rockwood</a>.

On the north side of the county line, I-75 begins to run inland of, and parallel to, the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a>, entering the <a href="Downriver">Downriver</a> area. The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with <a href="M-85%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-85</a> (Fort Street) near <a href="Gibraltar%2C%20Michigan">Gibraltar</a>, and the LECT departs I-75 to follow M-85 north of the interchange. The landscape transitions to suburban residential areas instead of farmland through this area. The freeway turns back northeasterly in <a href="Taylor%2C%20Michigan">Taylor</a> and intersects the southern end of <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Highway) in <a href="Lincoln%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Lincoln Park</a>. I-75 crosses the <a href="Ecorse%20River">Ecorse River</a> and passes through an industrial area of Metro Detroit. Further north, the freeway spans the <a href="River%20Rouge%20%28Michigan%29">River Rouge</a> in the southern part of Detroit.

I-75 parallels M-85 (Fort Street) and follows the Detroit River as far east as the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a>. Near the bridge's approaches, the freeway turns 90° away from the river and intersects the eastern end of <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> before turning again to follow the river further inland. From there, I-75 meets <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> (Lodge Freeway) and crosses under <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-1</a> (Woodward Avenue). East of Woodward, the freeway travels past both <a href="Comerica%20Park">Comerica Park</a> and <a href="Ford%20Field">Ford Field</a>, homes of the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> professional sports teams, respectively, as well as the site of <a href="Little%20Caesars%20Arena">Little Caesars Arena</a>, home of the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> and <a href="Detroit%20Pistons">Detroit Pistons</a>.

Immediately east of Ford Field, I-75 turns northwesterly to follow the Chrysler Freeway away from the downtown Detroit area. The transition from the Fisher Freeway involves a set of one-lane ramps through the interchange with the connections to <a href="Interstate%20375%20%28Michigan%29">I-375</a> and <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-3</a> (Gratiot Avenue). Heading north-northwesterly, I-75 passes to the east of the campus of <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a> and through an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> (Edsel Ford Freeway). The Chrysler Freeway passes to the west of <a href="Hamtramck%2C%20Michigan">Hamtramck</a> and to the east of <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Highland Park</a>, <a href="enclave">enclave</a>s within Detroit. I-75 meets M-8 (Davison Freeway) and continues through residential areas of Detroit's northern side. North of <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (8 Mile Road), the freeway crosses out of Detroit and into <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a>. The Chrysler Freeway jogs through the suburb of <a href="Hazel%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Hazel Park</a>, site of the "worst freeway for accidents in Metro Detroit" at a curve near 9 Mile Road.

Further north, I-75 intersects <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> near 10 Mile Road. The freeway continues northward for about into <a href="Troy%2C%20Michigan">Troy</a>, where it turns westward. The route for I-75 zig-zags through Troy and <a href="Auburn%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Auburn Hills</a> as the freeway alternates from north–south to east–west to bypass <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a>. Near the <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a> interchange, I-75 passes the headquarters for <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>. Further north, by the <a href="M-24%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-24</a> interchange, it runs near <a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Auburn%20Hills">The Palace of Auburn Hills</a>. The freeway traverses through additional suburban residential areas as it runs northwesterly away from Pontiac. These subdivisions end north of <a href="Clarkston%2C%20Michigan">Clarkston</a>, which is the location of the northern terminus for <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a>. Continuing through <a href="Holly%2C%20Michigan">Holly</a> and <a href="Newark%2C%20Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Newark</a>, the freeway transitions back to a rural, wooded setting.

As I-75 approaches <a href="Grand%20Blanc%2C%20Michigan">Grand Blanc</a>, the landscape changes back to suburbs. <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a> (UAW Freeway) splits off to the north to bypass the east side of <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a>, and I-75 merges with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a>. The combined I-75/US 23 turns northerly to round the west side of the city. I-75/US 23 meets <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> near the <a href="Bishop%20International%20Airport">Bishop International Airport</a> southwest of downtown Flint. The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods, encountering the northern end of I-475 near <a href="Mount%20Morris%2C%20Michigan">Mount Morris</a>. I-75 passes to the west of <a href="Clio%2C%20Michigan">Clio</a> and the east of <a href="Birch%20Run%2C%20Michigan">Birch Run</a>, the latter home to a <a href="Birch%20Run%20Premium%20Outlets">large outlet mall</a>. From there, the trunkline travels through farmland in southern <a href="Saginaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw County</a>.

I-75/US 23 enters the southern reaches of the suburban <a href="Tri-Cities%20%28Michigan%29">Tri-Cities</a> at <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Michigan">Bridgeport</a> and proceeds northward through the area. The freeway passes to the east of downtown <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>. <a href="Interstate%20675%20%28Michigan%29">I-675</a> splits off to run westward into downtown, and I-75 curves around to the northwest to cross the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a> on the <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a> in the suburb of <a href="Zilwaukee%2C%20Michigan">Zilwaukee</a>. North of the river, I-675 reconnects to I-75, which continues northward into <a href="Bay%20County%2C%20Michigan">Bay County</a>. The freeway passes to the west of <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a>, encountering the eastern end of the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> freeway. From there, I-75/US 23 curves northwesterly to bypass Kawkawlin before continuing north to the <a href="Standish%2C%20Michigan">Standish</a> area through farmlands inland from the <a href="Saginaw%20Bay">Saginaw Bay</a>. West of Standish, US 23 splits to follow the <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> shoreline, and I-75 turns northwesterly to run inland.

West of <a href="Sterling%2C%20Michigan">Sterling</a>, the landscape changes again; in this area the freeway enters forest lands. I-75 continues northwestward through <a href="Arenac%20County%2C%20Michigan">Arenac County</a> and crosses into western <a href="Ogemaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ogemaw County</a>. <a href="M-30%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-30</a> passes under the freeway without an interchange as I-75 rounds the west side of <a href="West%20Branch%2C%20Michigan">West Branch</a>. On the northwest side of that city, <a href="M-55%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-55</a> merges onto I-75, and the two highways turn to run concurrently westward into <a href="Roscommon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Roscommon County</a>. East of <a href="Prudenville%2C%20Michigan">Prudenville</a>, M-55 splits from the freeway. I-75 turns northward to curve around the east of <a href="Houghton%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Houghton</a> and <a href="Higgins%20Lake">Higgins</a> lakes. Turning back to the northwest, the trunkline bypasses <a href="Roscommon%2C%20Michigan">Roscommon</a> to the south and transfers into southern <a href="Crawford%20County%2C%20Michigan">Crawford County</a>. About north of the county line, I-75 meets the northern end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a>, the former <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a>.

After the US 127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, and passes to the east of <a href="Grayling%2C%20Michigan">Grayling</a>. There are a pair of interchanges on either end of town for <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28Grayling%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-75</a>, and the southern one is a <a href="partial%20interchange">partial interchange</a>; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for <a href="M-72%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-72</a>; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/<a href="M-93%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-93</a> that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to <a href="Hartwick%20Pines%20State%20Park">Hartwick Pines State Park</a>.

Crossing into southern <a href="Otsego%20County%2C%20Michigan">Otsego County</a>, I-75 continues northward through <a href="Northern%20Michigan">Northern Michigan</a> forests. It passes to the east of the community of <a href="Waters%2C%20Michigan">Waters</a> and <a href="Otsego%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Otsego Lake</a>. North of exit 279, I-75 proceeds by the <a href="Gaylord%20Regional%20Airport">Gaylord Regional Airport</a> and crosses the <a href="45th%20parallel%20north">45th Parallel</a>, the halfway mark between the <a href="Equator">Equator</a> and the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a> by latitude. The freeway then traverses the west side of <a href="Gaylord%2C%20Michigan">Gaylord</a> and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county. North of <a href="Vanderbilt%2C%20Michigan">Vanderbilt</a>, I-75 enters southern <a href="Cheboygan%20County%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan County</a>, assuming the G. Mennen Williams Freeway name.

I-75 continues northward through Cheboygan County, passing the community of <a href="Indian%20River%2C%20Michigan">Indian River</a> and spanning the <a href="Indian%20River%20%28Mullett%20Lake%29">river of the same name</a>. North of town, the freeway traverses the area between <a href="Burt%20Lake">Burt</a> and <a href="Mullett%20Lake">Mullett</a> lakes before intersecting the southern end of <a href="M-27%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-27</a>; that highway provides access to <a href="Topinabee%2C%20Michigan">Topinabee</a> and <a href="Cheboygan%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan</a>. I-75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County. Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for <a href="C-64%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">C-64</a> and <a href="C-66%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">C-66</a>, a pair of <a href="List%20of%20County-Designated%20Highways%20in%20Michigan">county-designated highways</a> in this area. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a> and picks up the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT) designation before entering <a href="Emmet%20County%2C%20Michigan">Emmet County</a> on the south side of <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a>. I-75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US 23. After that interchange, the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> (LHCT) merges in from the south. There is one more interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a>.

The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 across the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a> that separate Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form the connection between Lakes <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Michigan</a> and Huron. The structure, unlike the rest of the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge%20Authority">Mackinac Bridge Authority</a> (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls and accepts credit cards at the toll booths. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a <a href="Gephyrophobia">fear of bridges</a>. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM 530 and AM 1610.

North of the Mackinac Bridge, I-75 passes to the west of downtown <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>, traveling between the <a href="Father%20Marquette%20National%20Memorial">Father Marquette National Memorial</a> and <a href="Straits%20State%20Park">Straits State Park</a>. There is an interchange north of the toll plaza that marks the eastern end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> in the state and the southern end of <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-75</a>. The LMCT departs I-75 to follow US 2 while the LHCT follows BL I-75 through town. The freeway curves around <a href="Chain%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Chain Lake</a> and the <a href="Mackinac%20County%20Airport">Mackinac County Airport</a> and meets the northern end of the business loop near <a href="Castle%20Rock%20%28Michigan%29">Castle Rock</a>; the LHCT returns to I-75 at that interchange as well. Continuing northward, <a href="M-123%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-123</a> (Tahquamenon Trail) intersects from the west as the freeway parallels <a href="H-63%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-63</a> (Mackinac Trail), the former route of US 2. I-75 crosses the <a href="Carp%20River%20%28Mackinac%20County%29">Carp River</a> and follows the shores of <a href="St.%20Martin%20Bay">St. Martin Bay</a> before meeting <a href="M-134%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-134</a>. At that interchange, the LHCT departs again to run eastward. Through this area, the freeway continues northeasterly, traversing the Eastern Unit of the <a href="Hiawatha%20National%20Forest">Hiawatha National Forest</a>.

I-75 crosses the <a href="Pine%20River%20%28Mackinac%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Pine River</a> before entering Chippewa County. The freeway takes a more northerly track as it travels under M-48 without an interchange. Farther north, M-48 curves around to connect I-75 with <a href="Rudyard%2C%20Michigan">Rudyard</a>, and the freeway turns back to continue northeastward. About northeast of Rudyard, I-75 passes next to <a href="Chippewa%20County%20International%20Airport">Chippewa County International Airport</a>, the former <a href="Kincheloe%20Air%20Force%20Base">Kincheloe Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Kinross%2C%20Michigan">Kinross</a> and <a href="Kincheloe%2C%20Michigan">Kincheloe</a>. North of there in <a href="Dafter%2C%20Michigan">Dafter</a>, the freeway intersects <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> (9 Mile Road). Beyond that interchange, I-75 picks up the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a> (LSCT) designation, which it carries the rest of the way north. On the south side of <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>, the freeway meets <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan%29">BS I-75</a> and picks up the LHCT designation one more time. I-75 rounds the west side of the city, passes the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20Municipal%20Airport">Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport</a> and the campus of <a href="Lake%20Superior%20State%20University">Lake Superior State University</a> before meeting the <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">customs</a> and toll plazas for the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20International%20Bridge">International Bridge</a>. From there, I-75 crosses the two-lane bridge and terminates at the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a>. , the toll rates on the bridge are $3 for passenger vehicles, $2.10 for commuters, and $4 per axle for commercial vehicles; currently the same toll rate is assessed in <a href="US%20dollar">US dollar</a>s and <a href="Canadian%20dollar">Canadian dollar</a>s. Motorists have the option to pay with cash or an IQ Card, an <a href="electronic%20toll%20collection">electronic toll collection</a> debit card that uses <a href="radio-frequency%20identification">radio-frequency identification</a> technology.

Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. The <a href="French-Indian%20Trail">French-Indian Trail</a> ran through southeastern Michigan between <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, Monroe and Detroit. The <a href="Saginaw%20Trail">Saginaw Trail</a> ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it connected with the original <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a> that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, an extension of the Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In the 19th century, the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> chartered private companies to build and operate <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a>s or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. By the first decade of the 20th century, only 23 of the 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.

The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> was formed on May 13, 1913, and several sections of the system were designated along the course of the then-future I-75. Division 1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division 2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division 7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie. The system was signposted in 1919, and those highways were marked on maps for the first time. The first <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish. <a href="M-76%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-76</a> connected Standish with Grayling, where the first <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> ran northward to Cheboygan. From there, M-10 connected to Mackinaw City. In the UP, <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-12</a> connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail. When the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was formed on November 11, 1926, most of these highways were redesignated as part of the national system. From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a>. At Detroit, M-10 was used as a part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a>. M-12 was used for <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a>.

The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) rerouted US 2 in 1933 between <a href="Rogers%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Rogers Park</a> and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <a href="Cedarville%2C%20Michigan">Cedarville</a> and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former routing was given the <a href="M-121%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑121</a> designation.

By 1945, a <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> designated Alternate US 24 (US 24A) was opened from the state line north to <a href="Erie%2C%20Michigan">Erie</a>. After World War II, the MSHD planned to convert several highways in the state to freeways. In planning maps from 1947, the modern I-75 corridor was included in the system that later became the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>. It was also included in the "General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955", or "Yellow Book" after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system.
The Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA), an agency which was created in 1951, proposed the construction of a <a href="toll%20highway">toll freeway</a> to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. The state highway commissioner at the time, <a href="Charles%20Ziegler">Charles Ziegler</a>, distrusted a separate agency dealing with statewide road building at the time, and he worked to stall progress on any proposed turnpikes. Ziegler, who had a seat on the MTA board, publicly sparred with authority chairman George Higgins, even announcing that the MSHD would build a parallel freeway that would "reduce tolls on the turnpike 40 to 50 percent" according to consultants. Trucking interests in the state also opposed the projects, preferring a moderate gas tax increase over any tolls. Detroit denied the MTA permission to route a turnpike through the city over issues related to the River Rouge, Rouge Park and access across the <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>. After a lawsuit by City of Dearborn, the legislation creating the authority was upheld by the <a href="Michigan%20Supreme%20Court">Michigan Supreme Court</a> in 1955, and the authority was allowed to sell bonds for its Bridgeport–Rockwood and Detroit–Chicago toll roads.

The original planning maps plotted the first turnpike to the west of Detroit, running near US 24 (Telegraph Road). This route was later proposed for I-75 itself; I-275 would have been the freeway to loop into downtown Detroit. The proposed length was increased by December 1955; the extended Michigan Turnpike would have run from a connection across the Ohio state line to Toledo north through Detroit and Saginaw and eventually to the southern end of the Mackinac Bridge. By the following April, any extensions were cancelled leaving the turnpike to its original termini; the east–west companion road was also cancelled at that time. The MTA proposed a state constitutional amendment in January 1956 that would allow the Michigan Legislature to issue state-guaranteed bonds for part of the MTA's construction expenses. According to "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>", the authority "struggled for survival" in the face of opposition from the MSHD just two months later; the department's actions impaired the authority's appropriations from the state legislature and its ability to sell the necessary bonds to pay for construction. When the federal government approved the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</a>, Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula. This announcement undermined the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike. By August 1956, the MTA voted to reduce its operations to a skeleton staff, but moved forward in May 1957 on a bond sale to finance construction of the roadway. Financiers stated such a sale was only feasible if the turnpike was to be safe from competition. The Michigan Townships Association called for the abolition of the MTA in 1958. The legislature killed a bill to do so in June 1959, but it later voted to repeal the act that created the authority in 1962.

The first sections of freeway for I-75 were opened in 1957, beginning with the southern section near the Ohio state line opened in October 1957. The <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> was opened to traffic on November 1, 1957; a new section of freeway and an <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a> connected US 2 to the bridge. The MSHD formally proposed the I-75 number in 1958. On June 30 of that year, the first stretch of the "Fenton–Clio Expressway" opened. Construction on the Chrysler Freeway in Detroit started on January 30, 1959. The I-75 signs were first installed along the Detroit–Toledo Expressway in October 1959, replacing US 24A signage in the Monroe area, after the state waited for final approval of the numbering system to be used in the state.
In November 1960, sections of freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches in Mackinaw City and from St. Ignace to <a href="Evergreen%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Evergreen Shores</a>, and by December, the section of freeway running between Evergreen Shores and <a href="M-123%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑123</a> was scheduled to open. The next year the original <a href="Zilwaukee%20Bridge">Zilwaukee Bridge</a>, a <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> across the <a href="Saginaw%20River">Saginaw River</a> was opened along with a section of freeway north to Kawkawlin. That September, the section between Gaylord and <a href="Vanderbilt%2C%20Michigan">Vanderbilt</a> was completed, and in October 1961, the first segment of I-75 near <a href="Grayling%2C%20Michigan">Grayling</a> opened, connecting <a href="M-18%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-18</a> with the city. By the end of the year, the freeway was completed between <a href="Kinross%2C%20Michigan">Kinross</a> and <a href="Dafter%2C%20Michigan">Dafter</a> in the UP, and the former segment of US 27 between Grayling and Gaylord was turned back to local control. After this individual segment of freeway was completed, it left a gap between Gaylord and Indian River that was designated "TO I-75" on maps for the former segment of US 27, and US 27 was truncated to about south of Grayling. The section of I-75 was opened between Gaylord and Waters in July 1962. Another temporary "TO I-75" designation was applied along US 10 and US 27 from Bay City to Grayling. In 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of I-75 south of Detroit to Toledo be built as an <a href="Intelligent%20transportation%20system">electronic highway</a> under a bid through <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> instead.

On October 25, 1962, the section of freeway from <a href="M-24%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-24</a> near <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a> to the Flint area opened. The same year, the freeway gap was filled in between Gaylord and Indian River. The <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20International%20Bridge">International Bridge</a> and its approaches opened in Sault Ste. Marie on October 31, 1962. The following year, a set of segments opened in the Detroit area. The freeway was extended south from Pontiac to 11 Mile Road with a connection along <a href="M-150%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-150</a> to <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (8 Mile Road). Another section opened to connect with US 24 (Telegraph Road) in the <a href="Woodhaven%2C%20Michigan">Woodhaven</a> area; a TO I-75 designation was added to connect along US 24 and M-102 to M-150. On the other end of the state, the gaps in the freeway across the UP were completed in 1963 as well, and the section of freeway in Northern Michigan was named the most scenic new highway in the US in 1963 by "<a href="Parade%20%28magazine%29">Parade</a>" magazine. The first part of the Chrysler Freeway opened to traffic on June 26, 1964, the southern mile (1.6 km) of which was designated <a href="Interstate%20375%20%28Michigan%29">I-375</a>.
The segment of I-75 through the <a href="Downriver">Downriver</a> suburbs of Detroit between the US 24 (Telegraph Road) connector and <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Highway) was completed on December 28, 1966. The same year, I-75 was scheduled to open southward from 11 Mile Road to M-102 (8 Mile Road). In 1967, two segments of freeway opened. One was from Kawkawlin to <a href="Standish%2C%20Michigan">Standish</a> in October, and the other through Detroit extended I-75 along the Fisher Freeway in December. The first section of M-76 freeway from Standish northwesterly to <a href="Alger%2C%20Michigan">Alger</a> was scheduled to open in July 1968. A section of the Chrysler Freeway through Detroit opened on December 19, 1968, and the remainder was scheduled to open on January 10, 1969.

In 1970, I-75 through Detroit was completed, and two additional sections of M-76 were converted to freeway. The northern section ran from the US 27-to-I-75 transition south of Grayling to the <a href="Crawford%20County%2C%20Michigan">Crawford</a>–<a href="Roscommon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Roscommon</a> county line, and the second was an extension from Alger to the <a href="West%20Branch%2C%20Michigan">West Branch</a> area. The first ice-detection system in the state was installed on the River Rouge bridges in the Detroit area in an attempt to maximize driver safety.

Since the freeway was completed, a few changes have been made to I-75 in Michigan. MDOT truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I‑75 freeway in 1983. In 1986, US 10 was truncated to Bay City, removing its concurrency with I-75 from there to <a href="Clarkston%2C%20Michigan">Clarkston</a>. Two years later, the original bascule Zilwaukee Bridge across the Saginaw River was replaced by a much higher structure slightly north of the former bridge. All of I-75 within Michigan was named the Tuskegee Airmen Memorial Highway, in honor of the <a href="Tuskegee%20Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a>, at the end of December 2014. In May 2017, MDOT raised the speed limit on I-75 between Bay City and Sault Ste. Marie, excluding the Mackinac Bridge, from .

Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed completely to traffic in both directions from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit 49) to Clark Street (exit 47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road as part of the Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a>. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> to <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five months ahead of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The <a href="Manuel%20Moroun">company's owner</a> was jailed for <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a> during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.

I-75 has five named segments in Michigan. The southernmost section from the state line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit is known as the Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded <a href="Fisher%20Body">Fisher Body</a>, later a part of <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for <a href="Walter%20P.%20Chrysler">Walter P. Chrysler</a>, founder of <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.

Officially, the entire length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a practical matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act 174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution 216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.

Two other segments near the Straits of Mackinac were named in 1976 for figures instrumental in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. From the Cheboygan–Otsego county line north to the bridge, I-75 was named for <a href="G.%20Mennen%20Williams">G. Mennen Williams</a>, the former governor once called "Michigan's Politician of the Century" in the press. The section in Mackinac County from the northern end of the Mackinac Bridge was named for <a href="Prentiss%20M.%20Brown">Prentiss M. Brown</a>, the former <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Senate">Senator</a> who served on the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge%20Authority">MBA</a> board until his death in 1971.

Along its route in the state, I-75 utilizes three of Michigan's monumental bridges. The first of them is the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw. The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> to allow shipping traffic to use the river. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on I-75/US 10/US 23 for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends. Approved in 1974, construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979. A major construction accident in August 1982 delayed completion of the new Zilwaukee Bridge; a bridge pier partially collapsed when contractors overloaded a section under construction. The affected deck segment tilted to rest higher on one end and lower on the other. The structure was originally supposed to cost $76.8 million with a 1983 completion date; in the end it cost $131.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) when the southbound span finally opened on September 19, 1988. The structure is the largest concrete segmental bridge in the United States.
The second is the Mackinac Bridge that connects Michigan's two peninsulas at the Straits of Mackinac. A structure was first proposed in 1888 by one of the directors of the <a href="Grand%20Hotel%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Grand Hotel</a> on <a href="Mackinac%20Island">Mackinac Island</a>. Car ferry service was started in 1923 to cross the straits, and a bridge authority was first created in 1934 to investigate the possibility of building a permanent connection across the straits. This early authority started with a 1921 proposal for a series of bridges that would have connected <a href="Cheboygan%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan</a> to <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a> by way of <a href="Bois%20Blanc%20Island%20%28Michigan%29">Bois Blanc</a>, <a href="Round%20Island%20%28Michigan%29">Round</a>, and Mackinac islands. The federal <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a> rejected loan and grant requests for that project. A second, direct crossing was then proposed based on designs used for the <a href="Tacoma%20Narrows%20Bridge%20%281940%29">Tacoma Narrows Bridge</a>. The collapse of that bridge and World War II delayed any further work on a structure beyond tests of the lake bottom and the construction of the causeway on the St. Ignace side; the first bridge authority was abolished in 1947. The current agency was created on June 6, 1950.

The MBA was authorized in 1952 to sell bonds to finance construction, which were sold on December 17, 1953, to finance the $99.8 million (equivalent to $ in ) cost of the bridge. The structure was designed by <a href="David%20B.%20Steinman">David B. Steinman</a> and built by <a href="Merritt-Chapman%20%26amp%3B%20Scott">Merritt-Chapman & Scott</a> for the substructure and the <a href="American%20Bridge%20Company">American Bridge Company</a> division of <a href="U.S.%20Steel%20Corporation">U.S. Steel Corporation</a> for the superstructure. Construction started in 1954 and the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic on November 1, 1957. Final work on the bridge was completed in September 1958. Overall, the structure has a central suspension span flanked by two side spans. With the two backstay spans, the Mackinac Bridge is long between cable anchorages, the longest in the world at the time it opened. The total length of the structure is with two towers and of clearance for passing ships under the main span. In 2000, the bridge was named "Michigan's No. 1 Civil Engineering Project of the 20th Century" by the Michigan Section of the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> (ASCE), and the structure was named a <a href="National%20Historic%20Civil%20Engineering%20Landmark">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> in 2010 by the national ASCE.
The northernmost of the three monumental bridges along I-75 is the International Bridge, linking the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie in <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Michigan</a> and <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Ontario">Ontario</a>. The governments on each side of the international border formed a bridge authority to build a highway bridge in 1935. Construction started on the structure September 16, 1960. The International Bridge is nearly long, encompassing spans over the American and Canadian navigation channels for the <a href="Soo%20Locks">Soo Locks</a> and the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Michigan%E2%80%93Ontario%29">St. Mary's River</a>. The American approach is , and the Canadian approach is . The center span over the river is , flanked by and spans over the American and Canadian shipping channels, respectively. The bridge was designed by the same firm that handled the Mackinac Bridge for a cost of $20 million (equivalent to $ in ). It opened to traffic on October 31, 1962.

There are four <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstate Highways</a> for I-75 in Michigan. <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> begins as a loop from northern Monroe County and continues to connect with I-96 and I-696. The freeway serves the population of western Wayne County and <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>. The highway was originally intended to connect with I-75 north of Pontiac. <a href="Interstate%20375%20%28Michigan%29">I-375</a> was the shortest signed Interstate in the nation; it serves the immediate downtown <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> area. <a href="Interstate%20475%20%28Michigan%29">I-475</a> is known as the UAW Freeway and the David Dunbar Buick Freeway. This freeway serves Flint's downtown areas as I-75 goes to the west side of the city.

Barge of the Dead

"Barge of the Dead" is an episode of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction television</a> series "". It is the third episode of the and was first broadcast by <a href="UPN">UPN</a> on October 6, 1999. "Barge of the Dead" was developed from a story by <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="Bryan%20Fuller">Bryan Fuller</a>, who wrote the teleplay, and was directed by <a href="Mike%20Vejar">Mike Vejar</a>. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> and <a href="Maquis%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Maquis</a> crew of the starship <a href="USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Voyager"</a> after they are stranded in the <a href="Delta%20Quadrant">Delta Quadrant</a>, far from the rest of the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a>.

In this episode, the half-<a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>, half-human <a href="B%27Elanna%20Torres">B'Elanna Torres</a> (<a href="Roxann%20Dawson">Roxann Dawson</a>) has a <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a> and is sent to the Klingon version of <a href="Hell">Hell</a> known as <a href="Gre%27Thor">Gre'thor</a>. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (<a href="Karen%20Austin">Karen Austin</a>), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the "Voyager" crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars <a href="Eric%20Pierpoint">Eric Pierpoint</a> as <a href="Kortar">Kortar</a>, who ferries the souls of the dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.

Moore originally developed the episode as part of a pitch for the "" episode "<a href="Soldiers%20of%20the%20Empire">Soldiers of the Empire</a>". The idea was initially rejected, but was revisited for "Star Trek: Voyager". Following the episode's completion, both Moore and Fuller left the series because of dissatisfaction with their lack of control over its direction, and the perceived absence of strong story arcs across multiple episodes. "Barge of the Dead" was one of several episodes that addressed Torres' strained relationship with her parents and her Klingon heritage. Scholars have offered a range of opinions on Gre'thor, with the setting and ideology compared to <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, and <a href="Catholic%20theology">Catholic theology</a>. The episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.8/6 ratings share, meaning 3.8 percent of all households with a television viewed it and six percent of that number were actively watching it. It was a drop from the episode broadcast the previous week. Critical response to the episode was mixed; some <a href="television%20criticism">television critics</a> praised the focus on Torres and Dawson's performance, while others were critical of the representation of Klingon spirituality.

While returning from an <a href="Away%20team%20%28Star%20Trek%20term%29">away mission</a>, <a href="B%27Elanna%20Torres">B'Elanna Torres</a> encounters interference from an <a href="Geomagnetic%20storm">ion storm</a> which results in a <a href="concussion">concussion</a>. Commander <a href="Chakotay">Chakotay</a> finds a <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> artifact lodged inside Torres' <a href="Shuttlecraft%20%28Star%20Trek%29">shuttlecraft</a>, and Torres sees this emitting blood and hears voices speaking in the <a href="Klingon%20language">Klingon language</a>. Since the <a href="USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Voyager"</a> has been stranded in the <a href="Delta%20Quadrant">Delta Quadrant</a>, the crew is several thousand <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Klingon-controlled space. <a href="Morale">Morale</a> officer <a href="Neelix">Neelix</a> plans a celebration of the discovery of the object, believing it originates from the <a href="Alpha%20Quadrant">Alpha Quadrant</a> and thus proves that the USS "Voyager" is getting closer to home; Torres resists the proposal for a party. She consults with Security Chief <a href="Tuvok">Tuvok</a>, who believes her negative response to the object stems from her hatred of her Klingon heritage. Tuvok assaults Torres with a Klingon weapon called a <a href="bat%27leth">bat'leth</a>, saying she is not a true Klingon before dismissing her as dishonored. While attending the festivities in the mess hall, Torres notices and <a href="Seven%20of%20Nine">Seven of Nine</a> singing Klingon drinking songs and <a href="Tom%20Paris">Tom Paris</a> eating Klingon cuisine. After witnessing several Klingon warriors killing the crew, she falls and finds herself aboard a boat. Torres discovers that she is being transported to <a href="Gre%27Thor">Gre'thor</a> on the Barge of the Dead, and learns that her mother Miral was placed aboard as a dishonored soul.

Torres, who was in a <a href="coma">coma</a> the entire time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the accident in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a>, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain <a href="Kathryn%20Janeway">Kathryn Janeway</a> permits Torres to put herself in an <a href="induced%20coma">induced coma</a>, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on <a href="Sto-vo-kor">Sto-vo-kor</a> (a version of the <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a> similar to the <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse</a> <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that "Voyager" is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.

The 43-minute, 56-second episode was developed from a story by <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="Bryan%20Fuller">Bryan Fuller</a>, who wrote the teleplay, and was directed by <a href="Mike%20Vejar">Mike Vejar</a>. David Bell edited the music, and Richard D. James was the production designer. The concept for the episode developed from Moore's failed pitch for the "" episode "<a href="Soldiers%20of%20the%20Empire">Soldiers of the Empire</a>", which would have seen the Klingon <a href="starship">starship</a> "Rotarran" travel to Gre'thor. Moore's idea was rejected as "too philosophical for this late in the ". The barge would later appear in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Online">Star Trek Online</a>", a <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> (MMORPG) developed by <a href="Cryptic%20Studios">Cryptic Studios</a> based on the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" franchise.

Moore only contributed to two episodes in "Star Trek: Voyager", with the other being "", the immediate predecessor to "Barge of the Dead". Discussing why he left the series, he said that he wanted to further develop more of its story arcs and characters, particularly focusing on the "internal strife among people trapped aboard ship(s) without any reasonable hope of finding sanctuary anytime soon".

Fuller also left "Star Trek: Voyager" after the completion of the episode, citing disappointment in his lack of control over the show's direction. He said that he "began to get itchy and wanting to tell stories with a little more emotional depth", and that he disliked how <a href="Broadcast%20syndication">syndication</a> discouraged longer story arcs spanning multiple episodes. Fuller's episodes frequently focused on "character development through adversity". <a href="ExtremeTech">ExtremeTech</a>'s Joel Hruska wrote that the show's later seasons would typically feature Seven of Nine, the Doctor, and Janeway to the detriment of the rest of the cast, while Fuller would draw more attention to the more underused characters. While discussing the episode, actress <a href="Roxann%20Dawson">Roxann Dawson</a> described the storyline as a "classic Star Trek story" due to its focus on family. The episode features <a href="Karen%20Austin">Karen Austin</a> as Torres' mother Miral, and also includes <a href="Eric%20Pierpoint">Eric Pierpoint</a> as <a href="Kortar">Kortar</a>, who ferries the souls of the dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.

<a href="TrekNation">"TrekToday"</a>'s Edward James Hines identified "Barge of the Dead" as the final part of a "probably unplanned 'Torres Trilogy'", which also included the episodes "<a href="Day%20of%20Honor">Day of Honor</a>" and "". Each one was broadcast as the third episode of their respective seasons; Hines viewed each installment of the trilogy as being linked by Torres' fear of death. He wrote that the episode showed how Torres becomes "responsible to herself and to others - no matter the risk - while choosing to live". Writer <a href="Paul%20Ruditis">Paul Ruditis</a> viewed the emphasis on Torres' "duality of nature" as leading to the development of several episodes prominently showcasing her character, including "Barge of the Dead". Ruditis connected Torres' storyline to Seven of Nine's in "Survival Instinct", writing that they both "deal with issues of life and death, with dramatic results". He referred to "Barge of the Dead" and "Survival Instinct" as "equally dark episodes". "Barge of the Dead" was also one of three episodes that featured Torres' relationship with her parents, with the episodes "" and "" resolving her estrangement from her father.

"Barge of the Dead" was the first episode to provide a detailed account of Gre'thor, which was previously referenced only in "Star Trek: The Next Generation". The title was developed from "the Klingon belief that the dead travel to Gre'thor on a barge steered by a ferryman". <a href="Religious%20studies">Religious studies</a> scholars Ross Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan L Schwartz interpreted the representation of Gre'thor and Klingon spirituality as borrowing from Norse and <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> mythology, specifically the crossing of the rainbow bridge <a href="Bifr%C3%B6st">Bifröst</a> or the river <a href="Styx">Styx</a>. Exploring the influence of the Greek story of <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> (Latin: Ulysses) on "Star Trek: Voyager", the <a href="Classical%20philologist">Classical philologist</a> <a href="Otta%20Wenskus">Otta Wenskus</a> points to <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Siren</a>-like creatures who call out with the voices of those loved by those on the barge. Though the motif of a barge and ferryman is not present in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s portrayal of the underworld in the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", it was subsequently popularized by its use in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" and <a href="Dante">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Inferno%20%28Dante%29">Inferno</a>". The pediatrician Victor Grech, in a paper on Klingon culture, interpreted Torres' belief in the Klingon mythological figure <a href="Fek%27lhr">Fek'lhr</a>, who tortures the souls of the dishonored, as being in line with <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> views of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>.

Kraemer, Cassidy, and Schwartz argued that "Barge of the Dead" mirrored the "" episode "<a href="Rightful%20Heir">Rightful Heir</a>" by not providing a clear answer whether Torres' experiences in the Klingon afterlife were real or part of a hallucination. The <a href="Native%20American%20studies">Native American studies</a> scholar Sierra S. Adare was critical of the portrayal of Chakotay—a Native American character—as dismissive of Torres' sincere belief in her experiences, writing that "[n]o Native person would ever dismiss another's visions as hallucinations or tell them to ignore their religious beliefs". She cited it as one instance in which the series represented Chakotay as "the quintessential <a href="Tonto">Tonto</a> in outer space".

"Barge of the Dead" was first broadcast on October 6, 1999, on <a href="UPN">UPN</a> at 8:00 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> in the United States. The episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.8/6 ratings share. This means 3.8 percent of all households with a television viewed the episode, while among those households watching TV during this time period six percent of them were actively watching the program. "Barge of the Dead" placed in 93rd place overall for the week. This marked a drop in viewership compared to the previous episode, "Survival Instinct", which had earned a 3.9 rating.

The episode was first released for home media use on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in the United Kingdom, as part of a two-episode collection with "<a href="Tinker%2C%20Tenor%2C%20Doctor%2C%20Spy">Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy</a>". It was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> as part of the sixth season on December 7, 2004. It was the only "Star Trek: Voyager" episode included on the DVD compilation "Star Trek Fan Collective - Klingon", which was released on August 1, 2006. The episode has also been made available on numerous <a href="Media%20streaming">streaming</a> <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> services, such as <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a>, <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>, and <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>.

<a href="Television%20criticism">Television critics</a> responded positively to Dawson's performance and the episode's focus on Torres. "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" Peter Schorn wrote that the episode was "[a]nchored by Dawson's panicked performance", and praised the focus on the character's internal conflict. While reviewing the episode as a part of the "Torres Trilogy", Edward James Hines praised it as "impressively manag[ing] to weave an evolving story of personal exploration"; he wrote that all of the episodes involved in the trilogy left a "legacy of imaginative, gut-wrenching storytelling".

The episode's representation of Klingon mythology garnered negative reviews from critics. "TrekToday" Michelle Erica Green responded positively to the performances by Dawson, <a href="Tim%20Russ">Tim Russ</a>, and <a href="Kate%20Mulgrew">Kate Mulgrew</a>, but felt that the storyline bore too many similarities to those from earlier "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" installments and the 1990 film "<a href="Flatliners">Flatliners</a>". Hines, of the same publication, was disappointed by the absence of Fek'lhr, who had been introduced in the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode "", and wrote that the character could have been included as guarding the gates to Gre'thor through <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a>. Hines was critical of the parallels between Miral and Janeway, believing certain sequences would have been more effective without Janeway present. Ranking it at number thirteen out of the twenty-two "Star Trek" episodes written by Fuller, <a href="Blastr">Blastr</a>'s Dany Roth praised the writer's attempt to better address Torres as a character, but felt his approach to the afterlife and spirituality were too direct and literal. John Andrews of "<a href="Den%20of%20Geek%21">Den of Geek!</a>" responded positively to the episode's emphasis on Torres and Klingon mythology, but felt that it was "still pretty hokey".

The series is set in the eponymous video <a href="dating%20agency">dating agency</a> based in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach, Florida</a>, and run by brothers Jack and Warren Baldwin (played by <a href="Peter%20Dobson">Peter Dobson</a> and <a href="Mitchell%20Whitfield">Mitchell Whitfield</a>, respectively). The remainder of the cast consists of their employees, played by <a href="Eva%20LaRue">Eva LaRue</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Bristow">Patrick Bristow</a>, and <a href="Cindy%20Ambuehl">Cindy Ambuehl</a>. <a href="Connie%20Stevens">Connie Stevens</a> was initially cast as the Baldwins' mother, but never appeared in the show after the <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot</a> was rewritten. <a href="Andrew%20Gottlieb">Andrew Gottlieb</a> was a co-producer, and <a href="Vince%20Cheung%20and%20Ben%20Montanio">Vince Cheung and Ben Montanio</a> were consulting producers.

The sitcom was the lowest-performing series tracked by <a href="Nielsen%20Holdings">Nielsen Holdings</a> for the 1997–1998 television season. Since UPN primarily marketed its programming to African-American audiences, critics questioned the show's lack of a black main character. With its inclusion of Ian, "Head Over Heels" was one of 30 U.S. programs to feature a gay, lesbian or bisexual character that television season. It received a negative response from commentators, who criticized its <a href="sex%20comedy">sex comedy</a> and characters.

Set in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a>, the series is about the Head Over Heels video <a href="dating%20agency">dating agency</a>, operated by brothers Jack and Warren Baldwin (<a href="Peter%20Dobson">Peter Dobson</a> and <a href="Mitchell%20Whitfield">Mitchell Whitfield</a>, respectively). Portrayed as opposites of one another, Warren is more involved in managing the agency than Jack. While Jack dates female clients, Warren still loves his estranged wife, who had an affair with a professional football player.

The rest of the staff includes two romance counselors: Carmen (<a href="Eva%20LaRue">Eva LaRue</a>) and Ian (<a href="Patrick%20Bristow">Patrick Bristow</a>). A self-identified <a href="Feminism">feminist</a>, Carmen is a <a href="PhD">PhD</a> student studying human behavior and sexuality. The bisexual, celibate Ian is frequently questioned about his sexuality, and former stripper Valentina (<a href="Cindy%20Ambuehl">Cindy Ambuehl</a>) is a receptionist who is knowledgable about computers. <a href="Karen%20Dior">Karen Dior</a> and <a href="Bernie%20Kopell">Bernie Kopell</a> <a href="Guest%20appearance">guest starred</a> in the series as themselves. <a href="Jim%20Lange">Jim Lange</a>, who Jack had idolized since childhood, also appears in an episode as himself.

"Head Over Heels" often relies on <a href="sex%20comedy">sex comedy</a>, leading "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"'s <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> to describe it as a "smutcom". Alan Frutkin of "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>" compared the show to the sitcoms "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>" and "<a href="Married...%20with%20Children">Married... with Children</a>". The <a href="Pilot%20Episode">pilot episode</a> features Warren having sex with a client in his office despite the agency's dating policy, and a bikini <a href="fashion%20show">fashion show</a>. Storylines in other episodes include Jack using <a href="Cap%27n%20Crunch">Cap'n Crunch</a> as an alias in <a href="chat%20room">chat room</a>s to seduce women and Valentina saying that she would open the mail topless for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1,000 a week.

Montrose Productions produced "Head Over Heels" in association with Jeff Franklin Productions and <a href="Columbia%20TriStar%20Television">Columbia TriStar Television</a>. <a href="Jeff%20Franklin">Jeff Franklin</a> was the show's creator and <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>. Referring to Franklin's work on the sitcom "<a href="Full%20House">Full House</a>", Dusty Saunders of the "<a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20News">Rocky Mountain News</a>" wrote: "I still wonder if Franklin isn't ridding himself of a lot of sexual TV frustration, after all those years with fictional giddy family members." <a href="Andrew%20Gottlieb">Andrew Gottlieb</a> co-produced the series, and <a href="Vince%20Cheung%20and%20Ben%20Montanio">Vince Cheung and Ben Montanio</a> were consulting producers. Despite being set in Miami Beach, "Head Over Heels" was filmed in Los Angeles. <a href="Matthew%20Diamond">Matthew Diamond</a> directed three episodes, and <a href="Amanda%20Bearse">Amanda Bearse</a> and <a href="Asaad%20Kelada">Asaad Kelada</a> did one episode apiece. <a href="Jonathan%20Wolff%20%28musician%29">Jonathan Wolf</a> and Paul Buckley composed the series' music.

During production, <a href="Connie%20Stevens">Connie Stevens</a> was set to play the Baldwins' mother in a <a href="recurring%20role">recurring role</a>. A writer for <a href="Turner%20Classic%20Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> described the show as "resurrect[ing] [Stevens'] acting career". Although <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) had ordered "Head Over Heels" due to Stevens, the network removed her from the project following what it described as "a creative change". In the series' original pilot episode, the mother is the dating agency's original owner who passes it on to her sons. A "cavorting bimbo of a mother", she has a relationship with a Hispanic <a href="personal%20trainer">personal trainer</a> and frequently talks about having sex with him. References to the dating company's history and the Baldwins' involvement were removed from the series. For the second version of the pilot, LaRue was added to the show after her character (<a href="Maria%20Santos%20%28All%20My%20Children%29">Maria Santos</a>) was removed from the soap opera "<a href="All%20My%20Children">All My Children</a>".

UPN ordered three new sitcoms for the 1997–1998 television season: "Head Over Heels", "<a href="Hitz">Hitz</a>", and <a href="Good%20News%20%28TV%20series%29">"Good News"</a>. They were part of the network's decision to expand its prime-time schedule to four nights a week. Although UPN targeted its programming at African-American audiences, "Head Over Heels" does not feature a black actor. Network president Dean Valentine denied accusations from "industry observers" that he was "abandoning the black audience or turning down projects featuring black stars and producers".

"Head Over Heels" was one of 30 U.S. programs that season to feature a gay, lesbian or bisexual character through its inclusion of Ian. About the character's sexuality, Patrick Bristow said he has "a rich, rich and spotted past". Sociologist <a href="Suzanna%20Danuta%20Walters">Suzanna Danuta Walters</a> wrote that Ian and Josh Nicolé Blair (in the sitcom "<a href="Veronica%27s%20Closet">Veronica's Closet</a>") represented a trend in which "homosexuality is a <a href="running%20gag">running gag</a>", and characters were in denial about their sexuality.

Airing after "Hitz", "Head Over Heels" was broadcast on Tuesdays at 9:30 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>; it was originally scheduled for 8:30 pm. The series had a <a href="TV-PG">TV-PG</a> parental rating for suggestive language and sexual situations; the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>"' Scott Pierce felt that it should have received a <a href="TV%2014">TV-14</a> rating for its sexual content. The series attracted a weekly average of 2.3 million viewers. It tied with <a href="Alright%20Already%20%28TV%20series%29">"Alright Already"</a> as the lowest-performing show (tracked by <a href="Nielsen%20Holdings">Nielsen Holdings</a>) of the season. The overall viewing figures for both shows was 2.7 million viewers.

"Head Over Heels" was the first casualty of the 1997–1998 season. Although 13 episodes were ordered, only eight were broadcast. Despite reports that the series would air through November, its final episode was shown on October 28, 1997. Dobson and Whitfield appeared in all eight episodes, Bristow appeared in seven, and Ambuehl and LaRue appeared in four.

The series received negative reviews from television critics; according to "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>"' Joal Ryan, it was known as the "Worst New Show of the Season" during its debut. Criticism was primarily directed at its sexual humor, such as a "Deseret News" writer criticizing its "tasteless, vulgar jokes about sexual performance, orgasms and bodily functions". Citing it as one of season's worst half-hour shows, the "Rocky Mountain News"'s Dusty Saunders described "Head Over Heels" as an unsuccessful attempt to emulate "Friends". Howard Rosenberg of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" dismissed the show as "the mother of all asinine sitcoms [and] a show with as much weight as a G-string". "Head Over Heels" did receive some positive remarks. Despite calling the show a miss for UPN, Tom Shales wrote that its humor was not as "ugly and vicious" as the sitcom "Hitz"; he also praised Patrick Bristow's <a href="scene%20stealer">scene stealer</a> and Valentina's technological aptitude as "a cute touch". The <a href="opening%20titles">opening titles</a> received praise from Adam Sandler of <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>, who described it as "stylish and provocative" and comparable to those for the crime drama "<a href="Silk%20Stalkings">Silk Stalkings</a>".

Critics disliked the show's characters and called the female characterizations <a href="Sexism">sexist</a>. David Zurawik of "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" singled out Valentina and the Baldwins' mother as examples of the series' poor representation of women. He was critical of the sexualization of Valentina, and the fact that the Baldwins' mother is defined through her relationship to her boyfriend. Sandler and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Daily%20News">Los Angeles Daily News</a>" Keith Marder felt that the show's characters relied on clichés. Marder summed up the series as "a mess of ridiculous caricatures and poor taste".

Ninja Gaiden, released in Japan as and as Shadow Warriors in Europe, is a side-scrolling cinematic <a href="action%20game">action</a>-<a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a>. <a href="Tecmo">Tecmo</a> developed and published it for the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES); its development and release coincided with the <a href="beat%20%27em%20up">beat 'em up</a> <a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%28arcade%29">arcade version</a> of the same name. It was released in December 1988 in Japan, in March 1989 in North America, and in August 1991 in Europe. It has been <a href="Porting">ported</a> to several other platforms, including the <a href="TurboGrafx-16">PC Engine</a>, the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a>, and mobile phones.

The story follows a ninja named <a href="Ryu%20Hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a> as he journeys to America to avenge his murdered father. There, he learns that a person named "the Jaquio" plans to take control of the world by unleashing an ancient demon through the power contained in two statues. Featuring platforming <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> similar to "<a href="Castlevania%20%281986%20video%20game%29">Castlevania</a>", players control Ryu through six "Acts" that comprise 20 <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>; they encounter enemies that must be dispatched with Ryu's katana and other secondary weapons.

"Ninja Gaiden" is renowned for its elaborate story and usage of <a href="anime">anime</a>-like cinematic cutscenes. It received extensive coverage and won several awards from video gaming magazines, while criticism focused on its high and unforgiving difficulty, particularly in the later levels. More than fifteen years after its release, the game continued to receive acclaim from print and online publications, being cited as one of the <a href="greatest%20video%20games%20of%20all%20time">greatest video games of all time</a>. It was novelized as part of the "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Power">Worlds of Power</a>" NES game adaptations written by <a href="Seth%20Godin">Seth Godin</a> and <a href="Peter%20Lerangis">Peter Lerangis</a>, and it spawned a soundtrack CD.

"Ninja Gaiden" features a ninja named <a href="Ryu%20Hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a> who seeks revenge for the death of his father and gradually finds himself involved in a sinister plot that threatens the entire world. The story opens with Ryu's father Ken being killed in a duel by an unknown assailant. After the duel, Ryu finds a letter written by Ken which tells him to find an archeologist named Walter Smith in America. Before Ryu can find Walter, he is shot and kidnapped by a mysterious young woman; she hands him a demonic-looking statue before releasing him. Ryu then finds Walter who tells him of the demon statues he and Ken had found in the Amazon ruins. Walter tells Ryu of an evil demon named Jashin, that "SHINOBI" defeated whose power was confined into two "Light" and "Shadow" demon statues. Ryu shows Walter the "Shadow" demon statue given to him by the woman, but during their conversation, a masked figure, named Basaquer, suddenly breaks into the cabin and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu gives chase, defeats the masked figure, and retrieves the statue; but when he returns he finds that Walter is dying, and the Light statue is missing. Right after Walter dies, three armed men confront Ryu and tell him to come with them.

Ryu is taken to an interrogation room, where he meets Foster, head of the Special Auxiliary Unit of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>. Foster tells him about a more-than-2000-year-old temple Walter discovered in some ruins in the Amazon. He continues saying one day Walter mysteriously sealed the ruins, and nobody has since ventured near them. Foster explains to Ryu they have been monitoring the activity of someone named Guardia de Mieux, also known as "the Jaquio", who recently moved into the temple. Using the statues, the Jaquio plans to awaken Jashin and use it to destroy the world. Foster asks Ryu to go to the temple and eliminate him. After making it into the temple, Ryu discovers the Jaquio is holding captive the girl who handed him the "Shadow" statue earlier. He orders Ryu to give up the demon statue after threatening the girl's life. Ryu is then dropped from sight through a trapdoor and into a catacomb.

After fighting his way back to the top of the temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom he defeats. As he is dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive, and Ryu will meet him as he presses onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers his father was not killed but was possessed by an evil figure instead. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged by Ken's release from his possession, shows himself; he tries to kill Ryu immediately with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed by Ryu during the ensuing fight, but then a <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin. After Ryu defeats the demon, Ken tells him he does not have much longer to live because of Jaquio's attack. He tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses, and to take the young woman with him. Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues; she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; they watch as the sun rises.

"Ninja Gaiden" is a side-scrolling <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> in which the player takes control of the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>, <a href="Ryu%20Hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a>, and guides him through six "Acts" that comprise 20 <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>. A <a href="Health%20%28game%20mechanic%29">life meter</a> represents Ryu's physical strength, which decreases when he is hit by an enemy or projectile. A "life" is lost when the life meter is depleted entirely, when Ryu falls off the screen, or when the timer runs out. A <a href="game%20over">game over</a> screen appears when all lives are lost; however, the player may restart the level where this occurred by <a href="continue%20%28video%20games%29">continuing</a>. At the end of every Act, the player fights a <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>; bosses have life meters depleted by player attacks. When its life meter is depleted entirely, a boss is defeated. Each boss is one of the "Malice Four"—evil underlings of the Jaquio, the game's main antagonist. The Malice Four consist of Barbarian, Bomberhead, Basaquer, and their leader Bloody Malth.

Players attack enemies by thrusting at them with Ryu's Dragon Sword—a <a href="katana">katana</a>-like sword passed down by the Hayabusa clan for generations. They can also use secondary weapons that consume Ryu's "<a href="Magic%20point">spiritual strength</a>". These include <a href="Shuriken">throwing stars</a>, "windmill throwing stars" which cut through enemies and return like <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a>s, a series of twirling fireballs named "the art of the fire wheel", and a mid-air slashing technique called the "jump & slash". When Ryu's spiritual strength meter is too low, the player cannot use secondary weapons. Players can replenish Ryu's spiritual strength by collecting red and blue "spiritual strength" items found in lamps and lanterns. Other items found along the way include <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a>es that freeze all enemies and projectiles for five seconds, bonus point containers, potions that restore six units of physical strength, "invincible fire wheels" that make Ryu temporarily invincible to attacks and <a href="1-up">1-up</a>s.

Ryu can jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the directional pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. He can also climb a single wall vertically by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.

<a href="Tecmo">Tecmo</a> first announced the Famicom version of the game in the January 15, 1988, issue of "Family Computer Magazine" under the title "Ninja Gaiden" (which would later be used for the game's American version). The game was released in Japan on December 9, 1988, under its final title "Ninja Ryūkenden", which roughly translates to "Legend of the Dragon Sword". It was developed and released around the same time as the <a href="beat%20%27em%20up">beat 'em up</a> <a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%28arcade%29">arcade version</a> of the same name; neither of the games were ports of each other but were parallel projects developed by different teams. According to developer <a href="Masato%20Kato">Masato Kato</a> (listed as "Runmaru" in the game's credits), the term "ninja" was gaining popularity in North America, prompting Tecmo to develop a ninja-related game for the NES at the same time the arcade version of "Ninja Gaiden" was being developed. <a href="Hideo%20Yoshizawa">Hideo Yoshizawa</a> (listed as "Sakurazaki") developed and directed the NES version. "Ninja Gaiden" was Masato Kato's first full-time project as a video game designer, and he contributed the game's graphics, animations and instruction manual illustrations.

Drawing inspiration from the "<a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Mario</a>" series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> as opposed to a <a href="beat%20%27em%20up">beat 'em up</a> such as "<a href="Double%20Dragon">Double Dragon</a>"; the gameplay was modeled after <a href="Konami">Konami</a>'s "<a href="Castlevania%20%281986%20video%20game%29">Castlevania</a>", with Ryu being equipped with a <a href="katana">katana</a>-like Dragon Sword, <a href="shuriken">shuriken</a>s, and <a href="Ninjutsu">ninpo</a> techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they used specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.

Yoshizawa placed greater emphasis on the story, unlike the arcade version, and wrote and designed a plot that included over 20 minutes of cinematic <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s—the first time an NES game contained such sequences. Tecmo called the cutscene system "Tecmo Theater" where the game reveals the storyline between Acts through the use of animated sequences. They are used at the beginning of each Act to introduce new characters such as Irene Lew, Walter Smith, and the Jaquio. This feature uses techniques such as close-ups, alternate camera angles, differing background music, and sound effects to make the game more enjoyable for players. Unlike earlier titles such as "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29">Final Fantasy</a>", the cutscenes consisted of large <a href="anime">anime</a> art on the top half of the screen with dialogue on the bottom half. This made the artistic style more reminiscent of other <a href="manga">manga</a> titles such as "<a href="Lupin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Lupin III</a>" and "<a href="Golgo%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B13">Golgo 13</a>". Dimitri Criona, Tecmo USA's director of sales and marketing, said that console games had an advantage over arcade games in that they allowed the creation of a longer game and the inclusion of cutscenes, which Tecmo trademarked as "cinema screens". He noted console games required a different reward structure than arcade games. The game contains a feature that was originally a <a href="glitch">glitch</a> but was left in the final game intentionally, according to Masato Kato; having lost to any of the game's last three bosses, the player is sent back to the beginning of the sixth act.

When the game's text was translated from Japanese to English, the game needed to be reprogrammed to accomplish this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English and then faxed them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would "edit it and put it back together, telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would go back and forth several times." Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text. Because of the NES' hardware limitations, the English text need to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by <a href="Nintendo%20of%20America">Nintendo of America</a>, who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christian</a>, or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.

Since the game's title was deemed too difficult for English audiences to read, it was renamed when it was released in Western markets. In early 1988 advertisements from "<a href="Nintendo%20Fun%20Club%20News">Nintendo Fun Club News</a>", Tecmo used "Ninja Dragon" as a tentative title for the U.S. release. They decided to use the title "Ninja Gaiden" (its original working title) when the game was released in the U.S. in March 1989. The title literally means "Ninja Side-Story", but the game was not intended as a <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of any prior work. According to an interview with developer <a href="Masato%20Kato">Masato Kato</a>, when deciding how to translate "Ryukenden" into English, the staff chose "Ninja Gaiden" "because it sounded cool". In Europe, the game was scheduled to be released in September 1990, but was delayed until September 1991. It was retitled as "Shadow Warriors"—just as "<a href="Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>" was renamed "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles"—as ninjas were considered a taboo subject in Europe. It was one of many ninja-related video games around the time, such as "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Kage">The Legend of Kage</a>", "<a href="Ninja%20Warriors">Ninja Warriors</a>", and "<a href="Shinobi%20%28video%20game%29">Shinobi</a>".

Upon "Ninja Gaiden"s North American release, Nintendo of America, whose play-testers liked the game and gave it high ratings, decided to help with its marketing. Nintendo's <a href="house%20organ">house organ</a> "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" featured it prominently. According to Criona, it did not take a lot of effort to market the game through the magazine, nor did Tecmo or Nintendo do much else to promote it. "Ninja Gaiden" received strong publicity in "Nintendo Power" in 1989 and 1990. "Ninja Gaiden" received preview coverage in the January–February 1989 issue of "Nintendo Power" in its "Pak Watch" section. It "got the highest marks of any title ... [the magazine's staff had] seen in a long time". It was expected to be No. 1 on their "Player's Poll" quickly. The preview compared Ryu's ability to climb and spring off walls to the gameplay in "<a href="Metroid%20%28video%20game%29">Metroid</a>". It was featured on the cover of the magazine's March–April 1989 issue and was referenced in the following issue in a "<a href="Howard%20and%20Nester">Howard and Nester</a>" comic strip. It was one of the featured games in both March–April and May–June 1989 issues of the magazine; both issues included a walkthrough up to the fifth Act, a review, and a plot overview. Underlining the game's difficulty, it appeared in several issues in the magazine's "Counselor's Corner" and "Classified Information" help sections.

The game was unveiled at the 1989 International Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>. Its display featured a demo of the game and a live person dressed as a ninja. Tecmo predicted that the game would be the top-selling, third-party title for the NES.

Demand for the game eventually exceeded its supply. While Tecmo anticipated the game would be a hit, according to Kohler they did not realize at the time the impact it would have on the video game industry "with its groundbreaking use of cinematics". Yoshizawa would go on to direct the sequel "" (1990) and remained as an executive producer for "" (1991), while Masato Kato took over directing the game design.

A PC Engine port of "Ninja Ryūkenden" was produced in 1992, published by <a href="Hudson%20Soft">Hudson Soft</a> and released only in Japan. It features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used in the earlier NES version. 

"Ninja Gaiden" appeared as a remake of the "<a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%23Ninja%20Gaiden%20Trilogy">Ninja Gaiden Trilogy</a>" compilation for the Super NES in 1995. Some reviewers appreciated the redrawn graphics and music in this version, but others found them to be an inadequate effort. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" reviewers compared it unfavorably to another updated NES remake, ""; they called the version "an exact port-over with no noticeable enhancements in graphics, sound and play control". Along with the other two games in the "Ninja Gaiden" trilogy, the SNES version was featured as an <a href="unlockable%20game">unlockable game</a> in the <a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%282004%20video%20game%29">2004 Xbox Ninja Gaiden</a> game.

The NES version was released on <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s Virtual Console on April 10, 2007, in Japan and on May 14, 2007, in North America. Europeans, Australians, and New Zealanders were able to purchase the game as part of "Hanabi Festival" on September 21, 2007. The PC Engine version was released for Virtual Console in Japan on April 21, 2009. The NES version was also released for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> Virtual Console, with an original release date set for November 8, 2012. However, it was delayed until December 13, 2012. The NES version was released on <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>'s Virtual Console in 2014. The game was also re-released as part of the <a href="NES%20Classic%20Edition">NES Classic Edition</a> dedicated console in November 2016, and for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in December 2018 as part of the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System%20%28Switch%29">NES: Nintendo Switch Online</a> service.

The game debuted at No. 3 on "Nintendo Power"s Top 30 list for July–August 1989, behind "" and "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.%202">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>"; it stayed at No. 3 in the September–October 1989 issue. The "Nintendo Power" Awards '89 featured the game as one of the top games that year. It was nominated for Best Graphics and Sound, Best Challenge, Best Theme, Fun, Best Character (Ryu Hayabusa), Best Ending, and Best Overall; and it won for Best Challenge and Best Ending. In its preview of "", the magazine said that "the colorful, detailed and dynamic cinema scenes of the original "Ninja Gaiden" set a standard for action game narration that has since been widely emulated. These cinema scenes made "Ninja Gaiden" play almost like a movie."

The game received strong reviews and publicity from other video gaming magazines at the time. In a review from "<a href="VideoGames%20%26amp%3B%20Computer%20Entertainment">VideoGames & Computer Entertainment</a>", the presentation and gameplay were compared to "<a href="Castlevania%20%281986%20video%20game%29">Castlevania</a>", while the cinematic cutscenes were compared favorably to "<a href="Karateka%20%28video%20game%29">Karateka</a>" and other <a href="Personal%20computer%20game">computer games</a> by <a href="Cinemaware">Cinemaware</a>. The review praised the game's animation in these cutscenes and noted Tecmo's usage of <a href="close-up">close-up</a>s and body movements. The reviewer said that while the cutscenes were not fluid, they were effective and entertaining and provided important information about what the player was supposed to do. He appreciated the game had unlimited continues which slightly offset its difficulty, but he criticized it for having over-detailed background graphics especially in the indoor levels, saying that some bottomless pits and items in these levels become slightly camouflaged. From July to October 1989, the game was listed at No. 1 on "Electronic Gaming Monthly"s Top Ten Video Games list; it fell to No. 2 on the list behind "<a href="Mega%20Man%202">Mega Man 2</a>" in the November issue. In their Best and Worst of 1989, it received awards for Best Game of the Year for the NES and Best Ending in a Video Game for all consoles. The staff said that "Ninja Gaiden" "proved to be an instant winner" with its cinematic cutscenes and unique gameplay. They added the game's climax was better than some movies' climaxes at the time and that it established <a href="continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> for a sequel, which would be released the following year. Later in June 1994, the magazine ranked it at No. 4 on a special list of Top Ten Most Difficult Games of all time for all consoles.

The July 1990 pilot issue of UK magazine "<a href="Mean%20Machines">Mean Machines</a>" featured "Ninja Gaiden" on the cover; the magazine was distributed as part of the July 1990 issue of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>". In its review, <a href="Julian%20Rignall">Julian Rignall</a> compared the game to its <a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%28arcade%29">beat 'em up arcade counterpart</a>, which was titled "Shadow Warriors". He noted the game has great graphics that feature diverse backgrounds and character sprites; he especially praised its use of cartoon-like animation sequences between Acts where the game's plot unfolds. He enjoyed the game's difficulty especially with the bosses, but he noted the game will seem tough at first until players become accustomed to the controls. He criticized the game for its sound, which he said did not fit with the graphics and was "racy" but added "what's there is atmospheric and suits the action". He highly recommended the game to fans of the beat 'em up and combat genres.

"Mean Machines" reviewed the game again (the NES version now officially titled "Shadow Warriors" in Europe) in its July 1991 issue. In the review, Matt Regan and Paul Glancey praised its detailed and animated character sprites and its difficulty level. The game's high standards of gameplay, sound, and overall depth impressed Regan; he noted the game's frustrating difficulty but pointed out that it has unlimited continues. Glancey compared the game to the 1990 NES version of "<a href="Batman%20%28Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System%29">Batman</a>" (released later in 1990) with its similar of wall-jumping mechanics; he said that its graphics were not as well-developed as "Batman"s but were still satisfactory. He praised its detailed sprites and their animations along with the "Tecmo Theater" concept, noting that the cutscenes "help supply a lot of atmosphere". He said it is of the best arcade-style games on the NES as well as the best ninja-related game on the system.

The Japanese magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" gave it a score of 28 out of 40. The game received some praise and criticism in the August 1991 issue of German magazine "Power Play". The review praised the game for its attention to detail and challenge and noted players need to master certain gameplay skills to move on. Criticisms included a "lack of variety" and dullness in gameplay which was compared to a "visit to the tax office". The PC Engine version was briefly mentioned in the December 1991 issue of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" as part of a review of games that had been released outside the U.S. They noted the faithful translation from the NES version as well as the revamped and more detailed graphics, saying "PC Engine owners should not miss this one!"

In 2004, Tecmo began releasing low-priced <a href="Episodic%20video%20game">episodic installments</a> of "Ninja Gaiden" for <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Wireless%20Services">AT&T</a> and <a href="Verizon%20Wireless">Verizon</a> mobile phones on both <a href="Binary%20Runtime%20Environment%20for%20Wireless">BREW</a> and <a href="Java%20%28software%20platform%29">Java</a> platforms. The official English Tecmo Games' mobile website advertised it for a future release along with a mobile version of "<a href="Tecmo%20Bowl">Tecmo Bowl</a>". The company planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 in a series of four installments—similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of "Castlevania" to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack as the NES version. Each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled "Ninja Gaiden Episode I: Destiny", was released on July 15, 2004; it included only the first Act from the NES version but added two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" in September 2004, but it—along with the third and fourth installments—was never released.

The mobile phone port of "Ninja Gaiden" was met with some praise and criticism. IGN's Levi Buchanan and "GameSpot"s Damon Brown praised the port for its accurate translation from the NES to mobile phones, saying the gameplay, graphics, and cinematic cutscenes remain true to the NES version. They praised the game's controls, despite the omission of the ability to duck so that pressing "down" on the phone's directional pad could be used for secondary weapons; Brown said the port had better controls than most other mobile phone games at the time. They both criticized the port for its lack of sound quality, but Buchanan said this was not Tecmo's fault. In a preview of the port, "GameSpot"s Avery Score pointed to generally inferior American-made handsets as the reason for the sound's shortcomings.

"<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" took a look back at "Ninja Gaiden" in its March 2004 issue, when the 2004 Xbox remake was released. They said the game broke the mold of conventional video game titles by including a plot with cinematic cutscenes added between gameplay segments, adding that the concept of adding cinematics for a game's introduction, plot, and ending was a new concept which "naturally impressed the gaming public". The article noted the game's high level of difficulty, saying the game "threw up an immense challenge even for the veteran gamer, and almost dared you to complete it mentally and physically intact". Chris Kohler, in his 2004 book "", said, while it was not as far-reaching as "<a href="Tecmo%20Bowl">Tecmo Bowl</a>", "it ended up revolutionizing video games with its courageous, unique, and trailblazing use of cinema scenes".

Upon its release on the Virtual Console, "Ninja Gaiden" was met with high praise, especially for its elaborate story, amount of narrative, and use of <a href="anime">anime</a>-like cinematic sequences. Some critics have bemoaned its gameplay for being too similar to "Castlevania"; similarities include identical displays on the top of the screen, items contained in breakable lanterns, and a nearly identical "secondary weapons" feature. A "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" review noted that the two games have different dynamics and that several actions possible in "Ninja Gaiden" would be impossible in "Castlevania". Contemporary reviews have considered the game "groundbreaking" for its pioneering use of stylized cutscenes, high quality music, and dark atmosphere. One review said that the game makes up for its high difficulty level with good gameplay. IGN said that it is one of the best platforming video games of all time.

Reviewers have criticized the game for its high and unforgiving difficulty level especially late in the game, and it has been considered an example of "<a href="Nintendo%20Hard">Nintendo Hard</a>" video games. A review by "1UP.com" referred to the later levels as an "unfair display of intentional cheapness". In his review of the Virtual Console version, "GameSpot"s Alex Navarro said "the game will beat you to a pulp" and that it "assaults you time and time again with its punishing difficulty, insidiously placed enemies, and rage-inducing boss fights". According to his review, the game starts easy, but the difficulty begins to increase halfway through the second Act and continues through the sixth Act; Navarro describes the sixth Act's difficulty as "one of the bottom levels of gaming hell". IGN said that the game was one of the most difficult video games of all time, setting the trend for the rest of the series; however, they pointed out that its difficulty and graphics are "defining characteristics [that] have carried over through the years into modern day ["Ninja"] "Gaiden" sequels". <a href="ScrewAttack">ScrewAttack</a> listed the game as the <a href="ScrewAttack%27s%20Top%2010">seventh hardest title in the NES library</a>.

Over fifteen years after its creation, "Ninja Gaiden" has maintained its position as one of the most popular games for the NES. A 2006 "<a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>" reader poll, with over 12,000 votes, listed the game at No. 10 on a list of top NES games. Another reader poll from "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" listed the game at No. 10 in its top 10 NES games list. It was No. 17 on IGN's Top 100 NES Games list. In August 2001 in its 100th issue, "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" listed the game at No. 93 in their Top 100 Games of All Time list. In 2006 "Electronic Gaming Monthly" featured a follow-up to their The 200 Greatest Videogames of Their Time, where readers wrote in and discussed games they felt were ignored on the list; the game was listed at No. 16 of the top 25 games discussed. At the end of 2005, "Nintendo Power" ran a serial feature titled The Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever. The list, which included games for all Nintendo systems, placed the game at No. 89. In August 2008, the same magazine ranked it the tenth best NES game of all time; they praised the gameplay and described the cinematic cutscenes as revolutionary for its time. The game's music received honorable mention on IGN's list of Best <a href="8-bit%20%28music%29">8-Bit</a> Soundtracks. IGN featured its introduction on its Top 100 Video Game Moments list at #53; it was also listed as the second best video game cutscene of all time in "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" magazine.

"<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" honored the game in its November 2010 issue, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NES. The magazine listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, as one of its favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced about the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game "may have taught me how to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that ""Ninja Gaiden" was about as cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their <a href="VHS">VHS</a> copies of "<a href="Enter%20the%20Ninja">Enter the Ninja</a>"". In a July 2011 issue, "Retro Gamer" listed the game's opening as one of the most popular at the time. The magazine noted how its use of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.

In July 1990 <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic Corporation</a> published a novelization of "Ninja Gaiden" under the "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Power">Worlds of Power</a>" series of NES game adaptations, created and packaged by <a href="Seth%20Godin">Seth Godin</a> under the pseudonym F. X. Nine. Godin and <a href="Peter%20Lerangis">Peter Lerangis</a>, under the pseudonym A. L. Singer, wrote the novelization. As with the other "Worlds of Power" books, the amount of violence present in the video game was toned down in the novelization, because Godin and Scholastic were concerned that some of the material in the video game was inappropriate for a young audience. The novel did not adhere strictly to the game's storyline; for instance, the ending was changed so that Ryu's father survived. Godin believed the revised ending was consistent with the "Worlds of Power" character. As real-life fathers Godin and Lerangis were reluctant to leave Ryu fatherless. On the book's cover, otherwise a copy of the North American box art, the <a href="kunai">kunai</a> held in Ryu's front hand was airbrushed out, leaving him prodding the air with an empty fist.

<a href="Pony%20Canyon">Pony Canyon</a> released a soundtrack CD, "Ninja Ryukenden: Tecmo GSM-1", in February 1989. The first half of the CD starts with an arranged medley of the game's music. It continues with enhanced versions of the game's music which used <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic sound</a> and additional <a href="Pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a> channels.

Art Houtteman

Arthur Joseph Houtteman (August 7, 1927 – May 6, 2003) was an American <a href="Handedness">right-handed</a> <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who played for 12 seasons in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> with the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> and <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. In 325 career games, Houtteman pitched 1,555 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a> and posted a <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win-loss record</a> of 87–91, with 78 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s, 14 <a href="shutout">shutout</a>s, and a 4.14 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA).

Known on the <a href="wikt%3Asandlot">sandlot</a> for his pitching motion, Houtteman was signed by <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a> <a href="Wish%20Egan">Wish Egan</a> in 1945 at 17 years of age. He was recruited by major league teams, and joined a Tigers pitching staff that had lost players to injuries and World War II. After moving between the major and <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a>s over the next few years, he was nearly killed in an automobile accident just before the 1949 season. Houtteman rebounded from his injuries and went on to win 15 games that season and made his only <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> appearance in the following year.

He played three more seasons with the Tigers, then was sold to Cleveland, where he pitched for the <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a>-winning Indians during their <a href="1954%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1954 season</a>. After losing his <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting</a> job, he played two more seasons with the Indians before he was bought by the Orioles, and he finished his final season in Major League Baseball with them. Houtteman ended his baseball career in the minor leagues and became a sales executive in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. In 2003, Houtteman died at the age of 75.

Art Houtteman was born in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan, on August 7, 1927. He was a second-generation American citizen; his grandfather Joseph had <a href="emigration">emigrated</a> from Belgium. The only son born to the Houtteman family, Art's father, also named Arthur, vowed that his son would become a major league player by the time he turned 17.

Houtteman played baseball at <a href="Detroit%20Catholic%20Central%20High%20School">Detroit Catholic Central High School</a>, where his pitching caught the attention of baseball scout <a href="Wish%20Egan">Wish Egan</a>, who praised Houtteman's "perfect pitching motion". Houtteman was signed by the Detroit Tigers late in 1944 and began to practice with the Tigers in <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> before the 1945 season along with fellow Detroit sandlot player <a href="Billy%20Pierce">Billy Pierce</a>. He spent most of the 1945 season playing for Detroit's top <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> affiliate, the <a href="Buffalo%20Bisons">Buffalo Bisons</a>. But injuries plagued the Tigers' pitching staff, and the 17-year-old Houtteman was called up by the parent club and began his major league career.

Due to Tiger pitching injuries, and with many top players still in the military late in World War II (Houtteman was too young for the draft), he made his major league debut on April 29. At 17 years old, he was the youngest player in the American League in the <a href="1945%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">1945 season</a> before being <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20transactions%23Options">optioned</a> back to Buffalo, where on June 20 he threw seven no-hit innings, facing only 22 batters in the process, but lost the game 2–0 in <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a>. He also appeared in 13 games as a <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a>, and finished his minor league season with no <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">wins</a>, two <a href="loss%20%28baseball%29">losses</a> and an <a href="earned%20run%20average">ERA</a> of 5.33 in just over 25 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a>. He was not on the active roster, and as a result did not pitch during the Tigers' <a href="1945%20World%20Series">World Series</a> victory over the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>.
Houtteman was the youngest major leaguer in 1946 but played only one game for the Tigers that season, allowing eight <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> and fifteen <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> in eight innings. He spent most of 1946 in the minor leagues, finished at 16–13 and led the league in strikeouts. At the end of the season, Houtteman was named by six of the eight <a href="International%20League">International League</a> managers as the top pitching prospect in the league, leading the league in strikeouts with 150, pitching over 200 innings, finishing second in victories with 16, and amassing an 11–2 road record. Minor league third baseman Johnny Bero liked Houtteman's fielding ability so much that he called him "a fifth infielder."

Despite his newfound top prospect status Houtteman remained in Buffalo at the beginning of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a> for a time, and saw little action. But after <a href="Hal%20Newhouser">Hal Newhouser</a>, <a href="Fred%20Hutchinson">Fred Hutchinson</a> and <a href="Dizzy%20Trout">Dizzy Trout</a> were used in two days, Tiger manager <a href="Steve%20O%27Neill">Steve O'Neill</a> decided to start Houtteman against the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> for only the second start of his career. He tossed a five-hit shutout and Tiger <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="Billy%20Evans">Billy Evans</a> said, "In 40 years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> star and future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, who said of Houtteman and <a href="Bob%20Lemon">Bob Lemon</a>, "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".

The <a href="1948%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">1948 Detroit Tigers season</a> began with Houtteman in the starting rotation. Things started off poorly, however, as Houtteman lost his first eight decisions. Two of the first five losses, though, were by one run, and he had little run support. The 0–8 start and lack of run support led to his being called "Hard Luck Houtteman" in the media. His first victory that year came against the Senators, in which he also drove in the winning run. After winning his next start, he defeated the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a> allowing only five hits, and avoided another loss. But he then lost eight more games and finished the season at 2–16. His teammates and the media attributed this to bad luck rather than bad pitching, and still regarded him as a prime prospect. Newhouser said, "The kid has had nothing but bad luck since the season opened", while Fred Hutchinson said, "He shouldn't have lost more than three or four games had he gotten an even break". But his 4.66 ERA was only 0.06 higher than the major league average.

As 1949 spring training began, Houtteman was nearly killed. In <a href="Lakeland%2C%20Florida">Lakeland, Florida</a> on March 10, while driving home from <a href="Florida%20Southern%20College">Florida Southern College</a>, he crashed into a fruit truck fracturing his skull. Originally listed in critical condition (a priest stood by to administer the last rites in extremis), he recovered rapidly and was able to talk with his teammates two days after the accident, telling them, "I'll be able to pitch sooner than you". Within two weeks, the Tigers were optimistic that Houtteman would be able to play again by June. As a result of the injuries to Houtteman and Yankee star catcher <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a> due to car accidents, Cleveland Indians playing manager <a href="Lou%20Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a> banned his players from driving, forcing the soon-to-be world champions to ride chartered buses to exhibition games.

Houtteman marked his return to the Tigers' rotation on May 21, 1949, but he lost his first three decisions. His performance improved, however, as he began to earn more victories in the 1949 season. These wins included a five-hit 2–1 victory over the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> on July 23. Over the course of the season, Houtteman beat each American League club at least once and beat the Yankees and Red Sox three times. He finished the season with a 15–10 record, a 3.71 ERA, 13 complete games, and two shutouts. He was placed in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">most valuable player</a> (MVP) voting, and received three points and finished tied for 22nd with teammate <a href="Virgil%20Trucks">Virgil Trucks</a>. The Philadelphia Sports Writers Association honored him as the year's "Most Courageous Athlete" because of his injury and comeback.

As the <a href="1950%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">1950 Detroit Tigers season</a> started, Houtteman was on a high note, pitching all of spring training without allowing a <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a>. He won his tenth game of the season on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside <a href="Bob%20Lemon">Bob Lemon</a>. After the game, he told an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, "I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after some of the things that have happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> roster alongside fellow Tigers including <a href="Ted%20Gray">Ted Gray</a>, <a href="George%20Kell">George Kell</a> and <a href="Hoot%20Evers">Hoot Evers</a>. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one <a href="earned%20run">earned run</a>, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a <a href="Ralph%20Kiner">Ralph Kiner</a> home run that made the game go to <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a>.

Houtteman continued his successful season in the second half. On August 19, he faced the Browns and pitched a <a href="no-hitter">one-hitter</a>, and faced the minimum 27 batters in the process. Houtteman ended the season just short of Ted Gray's prediction of 20 victories, and finished the season with a 19–12 record. He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in <a href="games%20started">games started</a> with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21. His ERA of 3.54 was good for fifth in the American League. He also earned six points in MVP voting, and finished tied for 24th. On October 2, the day after the 1950 season ended, Houtteman married Shelagh Marie Kelly. They met in New York's <a href="Catskill%20Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a> at Grossinger's Resort.

Before the start of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had originally been classified <a href="4F%20%28military%20conscription%29">4F</a>, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, "I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at <a href="Fort%20Pickett">Camp Pickett</a>", Virginia.

When he returned to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager <a href="Red%20Rolfe">Red Rolfe</a> noted, "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [last year's Tigers' team]". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number 21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.

It appeared that "Hard Luck Houtteman" had returned as the <a href="1952%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">1952 Detroit Tigers season</a> began. On April 2, 1952, just before the season started, Art lost his seven-month-old daughter in an automobile accident. In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Houtteman was one out away from a no-hitter when he threw a <a href="fastball">fastball</a> that was "supposed to sink" but did not, which Harry hit for a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a>. Houtteman said, "This was the only pitch I shook Ginsberg off the whole game", and for years afterwards, catcher <a href="Joe%20Ginsberg">Joe Ginsberg</a> repeatedly said to Houtteman, "If you'd listened to me, I'd have you in the Hall of Fame". Detroit won the game by a score of 13–0. After losing his tenth game on June 22, manager Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen. He finished the year with an 8–20 record and a 4.36 ERA. His 20th loss came on September 21 against the Indians, and he became the first Tiger to lose 20 games since <a href="Bobo%20Newsom">Bobo Newsom</a> in 1941. His disappointing season led to the possibility of a trade, with general manager <a href="Charlie%20Gehringer">Charlie Gehringer</a> acknowledging that Houtteman might be traded if the right offer came along.

Houtteman spent the offseason selling cars and making public appearances for the Detroit Tigers. During the <a href="1953%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">1953 Detroit Tigers season</a> there were rumors of possible trades for Houtteman, with the Yankees proposing the possibility of trading <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a>, an infielder, and <a href="Gil%20McDougald">Gil McDougald</a> for Houtteman. Gehringer said of Houtteman's high trading price, "Art has always had good stuff—much too good to be a 20-game loser". That season, he was used as both a starter and reliever during the season. However, he lost six straight decisions, and by the middle of June had a 2–6 record and a 5.90 ERA. This marked the end of his career as a Tiger.

On June 15, 1953, Houtteman was traded by the Tigers, along with <a href="Owen%20Friend">Owen Friend</a>, Joe Ginsberg and <a href="Bill%20Wight">Bill Wight</a>, to the Cleveland Indians for <a href="Ray%20Boone">Ray Boone</a>, <a href="Al%20Aber">Al Aber</a>, <a href="Steve%20Gromek">Steve Gromek</a> and <a href="Dick%20Weik">Dick Weik</a>. In July 1953, he returned to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted he wanted to be traded. He said, "The fans are down on me and I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach <a href="Mel%20Harder">Mel Harder</a> doing a "complete" overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace <a href="Bob%20Feller">Bob Feller</a>. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.

At the start of the <a href="1954%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1954 Cleveland Indians season</a>, Houtteman's second daughter, Hollis Ann, was born on February 22. His pitching continued to improve under Mel Harder, who "got me to quit experimenting and to seek my natural delivery". The Indians used him when they could, especially in extra inning affairs. In the Indians' first six extra inning games, Houtteman was used three times. As a result, Houtteman finished the season with a career-high 11 complete games. The Indians also began to use Houtteman and Feller for <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheader</a>s with great success, as they had a 9–1 record after their first five doubleheaders. Houtteman finished the season with a 15–7 record, a 3.35 ERA, and 188 innings pitched. In the <a href="1954%20World%20Series">1954 World Series</a> with the Indians, he pitched two innings in Game 3 against the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>, allowing one run and striking out one batter.

The <a href="1955%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1955 Cleveland Indians season</a> originally planned to use Houtteman as the number four pitcher on the starting rotation, as he had been the previous year. He saw himself remaining the fourth starter, and said, "<a href="Herb%20Score">Herb Score</a> won't beat me out of the fourth starting job with the Indians" on April 11. However, he became a <a href="spot%20starter">spot starter</a>, as he lost his starting position to Score, the "most talked-about rookie in all the major league training camps". He split starting time with Bob Feller and finished the season with a 10–6 record, a 3.98 ERA, and three complete games. On December 29, 1955, Houtteman's first son, Jeff, was born with assistance from <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> player <a href="Leon%20Hart">Leon Hart</a>, who was visiting Houtteman and helped deliver the baby.

Houtteman remained a reliever during the <a href="1956%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1956 Cleveland Indians season</a>. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> were willing to trade outfielder <a href="Jim%20Rivera">Jim Rivera</a> for him. A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again becoming part of the White Sox along with <a href="George%20Strickland%20%28baseball%29">George Strickland</a> was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.

As the <a href="1957%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1957 Cleveland Indians season</a> neared, tension was running high. There was talk about Houtteman's being "in the doghouse", or out of favor with the team's management, during the 1956 season due to his lack of starts. According to sportswriter <a href="Hal%20Lebovitz">Hal Lebovitz</a>, this was a result of the starting five for the Indians, including spot starter Feller, pitching very well during spring training. Houtteman was again brought up in trade rumors, along with <a href="Mike%20Garcia%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201923%29">Mike Garcia</a>, since the Indians were loaded with pitching talent. When manager <a href="Al%20L%C3%B3pez">Al López</a> was replaced by <a href="Kerby%20Farrell">Kerby Farrell</a>, Houtteman did, in fact, land in Farrell's doghouse. Farrell called him out front of his teammates after a poor performance in spring training. Houtteman pitched only four innings in three games for the Indians in 1957.

Houtteman was put on the trade bloc before the 1957 season, but he drew no serious offers because Cleveland seemed desperate to trade him. On May 20, after playing three games for the Indians, Houtteman was sold to the Baltimore Orioles for an undisclosed amount. Hal Lebovitz called Houtteman "a pitcher of considerable promise but who somehow has yet to cash in on it", despite the fact that he was in his 12th and final major league season. During the <a href="1957%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">1957 Baltimore Orioles season</a>, Houtteman made four relief appearances before he was demoted to the <a href="Vancouver%20Mounties">Vancouver Mounties</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>. He was brought back up to the major league roster to pitch on September 22, the final start of his major league career. In his final game, he pitched 2⅓ innings, allowing three runs on seven hits and throwing two strikeouts.

Just before the 1958 season began, Houtteman was cut by the Orioles, ending his major league career. Shortly after being cut, he signed on with the <a href="Charleston%20Senators">Charleston Senators</a>, a farm club of the Tigers. He had a 3.25 ERA and a 7–9 record for the Senators at the end of the 1958 season. In 1959, the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Athletics">Kansas City Athletics</a> decided to give him a tryout. However, despite what was described as an "impressive" performance, they cut Houtteman as they were looking for more youthful arms. Houtteman signed with the <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a> of the Pacific Coast League, and posted a 6–9 record with an ERA of 3.69 for the season. After the season ended, and after a third daughter, Sharon, was born in 1959, Houtteman announced his retirement from baseball at the age of 32.

After retiring from professional baseball, Houtteman kept baseball a part of his life and became a sports reporter for a television station in Detroit for a time. He later became a sales executive with Paragon Steel in Detroit, where he worked until reaching the age of retirement.

Elwyn Roy King, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (13 May 1894 – 28 November 1941) was a <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) during World War I. He achieved twenty-six victories in aerial combat, making him the fourth highest-scoring Australian pilot of the war, and second only to <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a> in the AFC. A civil pilot and engineer between the wars, he served in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) from 1939 until his death.

Born in <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, New South Wales, King initially saw service as a <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">lighthorseman</a> in Egypt in 1916. He transferred to the AFC as a mechanic in January 1917, and was subsequently commissioned as a pilot. Posted to <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a>, he saw action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> flying <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s and <a href="Sopwith%20Snipe">Snipes</a>. He scored seven of his "kills" in the latter type, more than any other pilot. His exploits earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, and a <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mention in despatches</a>. Returning to Australia in 1919, King spent some years in civil aviation before co-founding a successful engineering business. He joined the RAAF following the outbreak of World War II and held several training commands, rising to the rank of <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> shortly before his sudden death in November 1941 at the age of forty-seven.

Roy King was born on 13 May 1894 at The Grove, near <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, New South Wales. He was the son of English-born Elizabeth Mary (Miller) King and Richard King, an Australian labourer. The youth attended public school, and further educated himself in mechanical engineering via correspondence. Having been employed repairing bicycles, automobiles, and farming equipment, he was living in <a href="Forbes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Forbes</a> and working as a motor mechanic when he joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> under the name Roy King on 20 July 1915.

On 5 October 1915, King embarked for Egypt aboard HMAT "Themistocles", as part of the reinforcements for the <a href="12th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">12th Regiment</a> of the <a href="4th%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">4th Light Horse Brigade</a>. He joined the 12th Light Horse at <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Cairo%20suburb%29">Heliopolis</a> in February 1916, as the unit was reassembling following its service in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. The regiment was engaged in the defence of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> during May, and subsequently undertook patrols and sorties in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Desert</a>.

King transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) on 13 January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a> (also referred to as No. 71 (Australian) Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>, by the British) as an air mechanic on 18 April. He was assigned to a training squadron for flying instruction in August. On 15 October, he gained his <a href="Flying%20badge">wings</a> and officer's commission. Allocated to No. 4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21 March 1918. The same day, the Germans launched <a href="Operation%20Michael">Operation Michael</a>, the opening phase of the <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>.

No. 4 Squadron was operating its <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s in hazardous, low-altitude support of Australian ground troops when King arrived in France, and he had little opportunity for air-to-air combat. The burly King—nicknamed "Bo", "Beau", or "Bow"—also had problems landing the Camel; crammed into its small cockpit, his large frame impeded control stick movement. The resulting rough landings annoyed his commanding officer, <a href="Major">Major</a> Wilfred McCloughry, brother of ace <a href="Edgar%20McCloughry">Edgar McCloughry</a>. King's friend and fellow No. 4 Squadron pilot, <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, recalled that "there was some speculation that he might go home—but he proved himself an impressive pilot". Cobby often took King on "special missions" to make mischief with the Germans; No. 4 Squadron found that two-man patrols were generally able to lure enemy aircraft into a fight, whereas larger formations tended to deter engagements. On 14 May 1918, King shot down a two-seat German scout that was spotting for artillery between <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> and <a href="Bailleul%2C%20Nord">Bailleul</a>, but clouds prevented him from confirming its destruction. By 20 May, he had been credited with his first aerial victory, over a <a href="Pfalz%20D.III">Pfalz D.III</a> near <a href="Kemmelberg">Kemmel</a>–<a href="Neuve-%C3%89glise">Neuve Église</a>. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 1 June. On 20 June, he destroyed a German balloon over <a href="Estaires">Estaires</a>; although vulnerable to attack with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary bullets</a>, these large observation platforms were generally well protected by fighters and <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defences</a>, and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target. Later that month he shot down two more aircraft, a Pfalz and a two-seat <a href="LVG">LVG</a>, in the <a href="Leie">Lys</a> region.
King registered his fifth victory, an LVG, after raiding <a href="Armenti%C3%A8res">Armentières</a> on 25 July 1918. Four days later, he led a flight of six Camels from No. 4 Squadron escorting <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a> light bombers of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> in another raid on Armentières. In an action that the <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Australian official history</a> highlighted as an "example of cool and skilful air fighting", the DH.9s completed their bombing mission while the Camels drove off an attacking force of at least ten German <a href="Fokker">Fokker</a>s, three of the Australians including King claiming victories, without any Allied losses. He destroyed a German two-seater on 3 August and another the following day, sharing the second with <a href="Herbert%20Gilles%20Watson">Herbert Watson</a>. No. 4 Squadron was heavily engaged in the Allies' <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">great offensive</a> on the Western Front, launched with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> on 8 August. King was credited with two victories—a balloon and an LVG—near Estaires during a bombing raid on 10 August. On 12 and 13 August, the Camels of No. 4 Squadron operated in a massed formation over <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">S.E.5s</a> of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron AFC</a>, the former's two flights led by Cobby and King, and the latter's by <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a> and <a href="Roy%20Phillipps">Roy Phillipps</a>. Pickings were scarce and No. 4 Squadron's only success came on the second day when King and his flight collectively destroyed a two-seat <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a>.

On 16 August 1918, King participated in a major assault against the German airfield at <a href="Haubourdin">Haubourdin</a>, near <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, that resulted in thirty-seven enemy aircraft being destroyed on the ground. During the action, described by the official history as a "riot of destruction", King set on fire a hangar housing four or five German planes. He also, according to No. 2 Squadron pilot Charles Copp, flew down Haubourdin's main street, waving as he went, his reason being that "the girls in that village must have had a heck of a time with all that bombing and must have been terribly scared so I thought I'd cheer them up a bit". By this time the Lille sector was largely clear of German fighters. The official history recorded that on 25 August, "King went out alone as far as <a href="Don%2C%20Nord">Don</a> railway station, bombed it, machine-gunned a train, and returned among the low clouds—all without seeing any enemy". The only contact around this time was on 30 August, when King, <a href="Thomas%20Baker%20%28aviator%29">Thomas Baker</a> and another pilot shot down two <a href="Deutsche%20Flugzeug-Werke">DFWs</a> near <a href="Laventie">Laventie</a>. On 1 September, King destroyed an observation balloon over <a href="Aubers%20Ridge">Aubers Ridge</a>. Three days later he shot down an LVG after attacking a train near Lille with Cobby. He was recommended for the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) on 8 September. The award, promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 3 December, cited his "gallant and valuable service in bombing and attacking with machine gun fire enemy billets, trains, troops etc", during which "he ensure[d] success by descending to low altitudes, disregarding personal danger". On 16 September, following a lull in aerial combat in the region, King destroyed a Fokker biplane over Lille. Around this time he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> and <a href="Flight%20commander%20%28position%29">flight commander</a>. He took over "A" Flight from Cobby, who had been posted to England. By the end of September, King's tally was eighteen. He registered his final victory in a Camel on 2 October, when he used bombs to send down his fourth balloon.
During October 1918, King converted with the rest of No. 4 Squadron to the upgraded <a href="Sopwith%20Snipe">Sopwith Snipe</a>, whose larger cockpit was a better fit for him. He scored with the Snipe on both 28 and 29 October, the latter over <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>, in what is frequently described as "one of the greatest air battles of the war". At Tournai, amid a confrontation involving over seventy-five Allied and German fighters, King evaded five enemy Fokkers that dived on him, before destroying an LVG in a head-on attack. The next day, he downed three <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a>s, two without firing a shot. As he zoomed up from shooting one out of control, he cut off another. This second Fokker pulled up to avoid collision and toppled onto a third Fokker. One of the war's last air battles took place near <a href="Leuze%2C%20Aisne">Leuze</a> on 4 November. King's destruction of two D.VIIs in the space of five minutes, the latter in flames, capped his combat career. His tally of seven victories with the Snipe in the closing days of the war made him the highest-scoring pilot in this type.

King's final wartime score of twenty-six included six aircraft driven down out of control, thirteen aircraft and four balloons destroyed, and three other aircraft destroyed in victories shared with other airmen. This made him second only to Harry Cobby as the most successful ace in the AFC, as well as the fourth most successful of all the Australian aces in the war (his top-scoring compatriots, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert Little</a> and <a href="Roderic%20Dallas">Roderic (Stan) Dallas</a>, flew with the British <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> and Royal Air Force). King was recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DFC, which was upgraded to the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and awarded on 3 June 1919. The recommendation noted his victories in the air and described him as having "proved himself a very brilliant patrol leader" and as "a magnificent example at all times to all pilots in the Squadron by his keenness on the ground and gallantry in the air which was of the highest possible order". He was also belatedly <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> in July 1919 for his wartime service.

Following the end of hostilities, No. 4 Squadron joined the British Army of Occupation at <a href="Bickendorf">Bickendorf</a>, near <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Germany, in December 1918. The unit returned to England in March 1919, and King sailed with it back to Australia aboard <a href="Royal%20Mail%20Ship">RMS</a> "Kaisar-i-Hind" on 6 May. He left the AFC on 11 August 1919 in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, before gaining employment as an air courier for Larkin-Sopwith Aviation Co. of Australasia Ltd, which had been co-founded by fighter ace <a href="Herbert%20Joseph%20Larkin">Herbert Larkin</a>. While working for Larkin-Sopwith, King refused an appointment in the newly established <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a> (AAC)—forerunner of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF)—because it had not then offered a commission to <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara, VC</a>. In a letter to the AAC selection committee on 30 January 1920, he wrote "I feel I must forfeit my place in favor "(<a href="sic">sic</a>)" of this very good and gallant officer"; McNamara received a commission in the AAC that April.

King's career with Larkin-Sopwith involved many pioneering flights. In 1920 alone, flying a <a href="Sopwith%20Gnu">Sopwith Gnu</a>, he was credited with making the first aerial deliveries of mail and newspapers to various cities in eastern Australia, and with making the first aircraft landing at several townships in southern Queensland. He also competed in air races. By April 1922, working with Larkin-Sopwith's successor, Larkin Aircraft Supply Co. Ltd, King was reported as having safely flown 2,000 passengers and throughout Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. He soon left the aviation business to go into partnership with another pilot, T.T. Shipman, founding Shipman, King and Co. Pty Ltd. Importing and building machinery, the company was successful and allowed King to take up the restoration and racing of motor vehicles. He married Josephine Livingston, twenty, at St John's Anglican Church, <a href="Camberwell%2C%20Victoria">Camberwell</a>, on 31 March 1925. The couple had a son and a daughter.

In December 1939, soon after the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>, King joined the RAAF as a <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>. Initially considered for general flying duties, he was assigned training commands commencing in the new year. On 2 January 1940, he became the inaugural commanding officer of <a href="No.%203%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School</a> (No. 3 EFTS) in <a href="Essendon%20Airport">Essendon</a>, Victoria. Part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, No. 3 EFTS initially comprised a significant civilian presence, many of the aircraft and staff under King's control being from private airline companies and the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Aero%20Club">Royal Victorian Aero Club</a>; by July, all private machines had been pressed into RAAF service and the civilian element largely disappeared. King assumed command of <a href="No.%205%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Narromine">Narromine</a>, New South Wales, on 21 December. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, he took over <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Service Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, from Group Captain <a href="John%20McCauley">John McCauley</a> on 7 July 1941. In October, King was promoted to acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> and posted to command the newly established Station Headquarters Point Cook.

King died unexpectedly of <a href="cerebral%20edema">cerebral oedema</a> on 28 November, aged 47. Survived by his wife and children, he was cremated at <a href="Fawkner%20Crematorium%20and%20Memorial%20Park">Fawkner Crematorium</a>, Melbourne. His funeral service at <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria">South Yarra</a> was attended by hundreds of mourners from the military and civil aviation world, including the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, and a representative of the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Air</a>; the pallbearers included Air Vice Marshal <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a>, Air Commodore <a href="Raymond%20Brownell">Raymond Brownell</a>, Group Captain <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a>, and Wing Commander <a href="Henry%20Winneke">Henry Winneke</a>.

Elwyn Roy King's name appears on panel 97 in the Commemorative Area of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra. His youngest brother Francis, who served as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> with <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 30 Squadron</a> in New Guinea, died in an aircraft crash on 31 May 1943.

Flow (video game)

Flow (stylized as flOw) is an <a href="indie%20game">indie</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> created by <a href="Jenova%20Chen">Jenova Chen</a> and Nicholas Clark. Originally released as a free <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> game in 2006 to accompany Chen's <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's</a> <a href="thesis">thesis</a>, it was reworked into a 2007 <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> game by his development studio, <a href="Thatgamecompany">Thatgamecompany</a>. <a href="SuperVillain%20Studios">SuperVillain Studios</a> developed a <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> version of the game in 2008, and <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> versions in 2013. In "Flow", the player navigates a series of <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> (2D) planes with an aquatic <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a> that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into <a href="Dynamic%20game%20difficulty%20balancing">dynamic difficulty adjustment</a> at the <a href="USC%20Interactive%20Media%20Division">University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division</a>, and on psychologist <a href="Mihaly%20Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>'s theoretical concept of mental immersion or <a href="flow%20%28psychology%29">flow</a>.

The Flash version of "Flow" received 100,000 downloads within its first two weeks of release, and had been played over 3.5 million times by 2008. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> in 2007, and won the Best Downloadable Game award at the 2008 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>. It was nominated for awards by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> and the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA). Reviewers praised "Flow"s visual and audio appeal, but noted the simplicity of its gameplay; several considered it to be more of an <a href="art%20game">art piece</a> than a game.

In "Flow", the player guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like creature through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a <a href="top-down%20perspective">top-down perspective</a>, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred version of the layer below appears in the background of each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>s that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.

Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented creatures that perish when all of their segments are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore the health of the player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.

The <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> version of "Flow" features enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: one that can move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given the ability to move faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special moves are activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable at the beginning of the game. The PlayStation 3 version features a <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer mode</a> for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an <a href="expansion%20pack">add-on pack</a> that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.

"Flow" was originally developed as part of <a href="Jenova%20Chen">Jenova Chen</a>'s <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's</a> <a href="thesis">thesis</a> for the <a href="USC%20Interactive%20Media%20Division">Interactive Media Program</a> at the <a href="USC%20School%20of%20Cinematic%20Arts">University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts</a>. His thesis was on the concept of <a href="Dynamic%20game%20difficulty%20balancing">dynamic difficulty adjustment</a> (DDA), wherein a game adjusts its reactions to a player based on the past and present actions of that player. He illustrated his ideas with "Flow", which he created in collaboration with Nicholas Clark. Chen implemented DDA by causing the player to change the game's difficulty subconsciously; he allowed players to dive between planes at will, and provided the option of eating or not eating any creature. Players may decide to rush downwards, or to grow stronger before attacking powerful opponents. Chen described "Flow" as "a simple game. It's the simplest test of active DDA." Another influence on the game was psychologist <a href="Mihaly%20Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>'s work on <a href="flow%20%28psychology%29">flow</a>, wherein a person fully immerses themselves in an activity and gains a feeling of energized focus. To achieve this state, the person or player must have control over the activity; Chen believed that his DDA theory gave players the control necessary to achieve flow while playing.

The game was released in March 2006, after two months of development—during which Chen and Clark taught themselves Flash programming. The game's <a href="source%20code">source code</a> was later released in 2009. The game's score was composed by <a href="Austin%20Wintory">Austin Wintory</a>. A PlayStation 3 version was announced for the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> in May of that year, and was released in February 2007. Chen had graduated by that point, and had founded <a href="Thatgamecompany">Thatgamecompany</a>, which handled the conversion to the PlayStation 3; Nicholas Clark was one of the employees and served as the game version's designer. Impressed by "Flow", Sony provided Thatgamecompany with finances, supplies, and additional staff, and offered them a three-game contract; the PlayStation 3 version of "Flow" was the first of these. Chen originally believed that the conversion could be completed in four months, and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>. However, when it was finally released in February 2007, it did not include "half of the original design".

A version for the PlayStation Portable, developed by <a href="SuperVillain%20Studios">SuperVillain Studios</a>, was released in March 2008. The company coded it from scratch, as the PlayStation 3 version's code and art were too platform-specific to reuse. The add-on pack for the PlayStation 3 version was also developed by SuperVillain. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role, as they were creating their next title, "<a href="Flower%20%28video%20game%29">Flower</a>". <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Sony Santa Monica</a> created ports of the PlayStation 3 game for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. Although no album of music specifically for "Flow" has been released, in 2012 Austin Wintory released "Journey Bonus Bundle" as a download-only album on <a href="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</a>, containing variations on themes from "Flow" and "<a href="Journey%20%282012%20video%20game%29">Journey</a>", a 2012 PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany.

The Flash version of "Flow" received 100,000 downloads within its first two weeks of release. By July 2006, it had been downloaded over 650,000 times; by February 2008, it had been played over 3.5 million times. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007. "Flow" received the 2008 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a> nominations for the Innovation Award and Best Debut, and was presented with Best Downloadable Game. The game was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) awards. Its music garnered nominations for Best Interactive Score and Most Innovative Use of Audio from the Game Audio Network Guild, and won composer Austin Wintory the Rookie of the Year award. "Flow" was a finalist at the 2007 <a href="Slamdance%20Film%20Festival%23Slamdance%20Guerrilla%20Games%20Competition">Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition</a>, but withdrew along with several other finalists after "<a href="Super%20Columbine%20Massacre%20RPG%21">Super Columbine Massacre RPG!</a>" was removed from the competition. In 2011 it was chosen through a public vote out of an initial selection of 240 to be one of 80 games showcased in a 2012 exhibit at the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a> titled "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Video%20Games">The Art of Video Games</a>".

"Flow" received mixed reviews from critics, who focused on the game's PlayStation versions. The visuals and presentation were among its most praised elements, with <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Chris Roper calling them "one of "Flow"s greatest strengths". Alex Navarro of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> agreed, saying that it was "hard to argue with those aesthetics"; he lauded the use of color, the designs of the creatures, and the <a href="dynamic%20music">dynamic soundtrack</a>. Will Freeman of VideoGamer.com called it "attractive and stylish", which made the game "immensely satisfying to toy with". Richard Leadbetter of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> claimed that the game's main purpose was to "look pretty" and "sound cool".

Reviewers were mixed in their opinions on the gameplay; Roper said that "simply see[ing] what's next" was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying that "Flow" "feels like a tech demo in many ways", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily "to act as a tour guide" through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that "it would not be unfair to describe "Flow" as empty and without substance." Navarro concluded that "Flow" was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but that it lacked "a lasting gameplay experience"; he attributed this to the game's "heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay". Luke Mitchell of <a href="PALGN">PALGN</a>, however, felt that "anything more complicated would take away from the friendly nature of an experience of this type."

Reviewers found the game to be largely unchallenging. Roper stated that "there really isn't any sort of a challenge here", particularly due to the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>'s inability to die; Leadbetter summed up the game's difficulty as "negligible". However, when reviewing the PlayStation Portable version of the game, Justin Calvart of GameSpot took the view that "the game's difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level", so that it does not become overly "frantic or frustrating". Reviewers were universally dismissive of the multiplayer mode, with Calvart saying that "whatever it is, it's not good". Leadbetter called the PlayStation 3 version's multiplayer "little more than an afterthought", while Navarro said that it "doesn't add a lick of depth to the experience".

Overall, reviewers saw "Flow" as being more akin to an <a href="art%20game">art piece</a> than a game. Navarro called it an "arty piece of gaming", and complimentarily said that it had the "vibe of an art-school project". Leadbetter believed that it was more of an experiment than a traditional game, and described it as a "trippy ornament". Freeman called it the PlayStation 3's "first art-house title". Roper summarized "Flow" as "not so much a game as it is an experience", and Mitchell claimed that it "tries to do something entirely unique and experimental, and on that level, it succeeds".

Rainbow pitta

The rainbow pitta ("Pitta iris") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="Pitta%20%28genus%29">pitta</a> <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Pitta">Pittidae</a>, <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to northern Australia. The species is most closely related to the <a href="superb%20pitta">superb pitta</a> of <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a>. A colourful bird, it has a velvet black head with chestnut stripes above the eyes, olive green upper parts, black underparts, a bright red belly and an olive green tail. An Australian <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a>, the rainbow pitta lives in the <a href="Seasonal%20tropical%20forest">monsoon forests</a>, as well as some drier <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forests.

As with other pittas, it is a secretive and shy bird. The diet consists mainly of insects, <a href="arthropods">arthropods</a> and small vertebrates. Pairs defend territories and breed during the rainy season, as this time of year provides the most food for nestlings. The female lays three to four eggs with blotches inside its large domed nest. Both parents defend the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. Although the species has a small global range it is locally common and the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed it as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>.

The rainbow pitta was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by the English <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> and bird artist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1842 based on a specimen collected on the <a href="Cobourg%20Peninsula">Cobourg Peninsula</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> of Australia. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "iris" is taken from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for "rainbow"; this is the origin of the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> as well.

The <a href="species">species</a> was once treated as a subspecies of the <a href="noisy%20pitta">noisy pitta</a> of eastern Australia, and was also treated as being in a <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> with that species, the <a href="elegant%20pitta">elegant pitta</a> and the <a href="black-faced%20pitta">black-faced pitta</a>, although that arrangement was not universally accepted. A 2006 study of the <a href="Molecular%20genetics">nuclear DNA</a> of the pittas and other Old World <a href="suboscine">suboscine</a>s found that its closest relative was the <a href="superb%20pitta">superb pitta</a> of <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a> off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The same study resulted in the pitta family being split from one <a href="genus">genus</a> into three, this species remaining in the genus "<a href="Pitta%20%28genus%29">Pitta</a>".

The species was long thought to be <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a>, but in 1999 the <a href="Western%20Australian">Western Australian</a> population was split into the <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> "P. i. johnstoneiana" by <a href="Richard%20Schodde">Richard Schodde</a> and <a href="Ian%20J.%20Mason">Ian J. Mason</a>.

The rainbow pitta is in length, and weighs . Females weigh , slightly more on average than males, which weigh . It typically stands upright while looking for food or resting, with the legs slightly bent, and the body held at a 60–70° angle. It moves around by hopping. Its head, neck, breast, and upper belly are velvet black, its upperparts are olive-green, and its lower belly and are scarlet red. The wings are green with a golden sheen and have a shining blue patch on the lesser , and the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s and underwing are black. The tail is olive-green with a black base and the sometimes have a silvery-blue band across them. It has a black <a href="Beak">bill</a>, pink legs, brown eyes and a chestnut stripe along each side of its crown. Many individuals display the pitta family's characteristic dark streaks, which can be arrow-shaped or stripes, through the middle of the feathers of the upper part of the body; examination of <a href="Bird%20collections">study skins</a> have found around 60% of rainbow pittas have them. This varies somewhat regionally, as birds from <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> were found to have none. Uniquely in the pitta family the streaks are not dusky or blackish but are instead bronze-coloured in this species.

The plumage is essentially the same for both sexes; females may have slightly more buff-yellow in their flanks and a slightly different shade of red on the lower belly, but these differences do not make the sexes distinguishable by plumage. The subspecies "P. i. johnstoneiana" is very similar to the <a href="nominate%20race">nominate race</a>, except the chestnut eyebrow is larger, as is the wing-spot, but the bird overall is slightly smaller.

The rainbow pitta is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and is found from sea-level to . It is the only species of pitta endemic to Australia. In the Northern Territory it is found in the <a href="Top%20End">Top End</a>, from Darwin east to the edge of the <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Escarpment</a>. Further east it is found on <a href="Groote%20Eylandt">Groote Eylandt</a> and the <a href="Wessel%20Islands">Wessel Islands</a>. In Western Australia it is restricted to the coastal <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a>, from <a href="Walcott%20Inlet">Walcott Inlet</a> to <a href="Middle%20Osborn%20Island">Middle Osborn Island</a>. It is also found on some of the islands of the <a href="Bonaparte%20Archipelago">Bonaparte Archipelago</a>.

It is found most commonly in <a href="monsoon%20forest">monsoon forest</a> and in adjacent vine-scrub and gallery forest, and also occurs in <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forest, bamboo forests, <a href="Melaleuca">paperbark forest</a> and scrub, "<a href="Lophostemon">Lophostemon</a>" forests and the edges of <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests (but never in mangrove forests themselves). It is mostly found in closed forests, but is also found in more open forests. It has sometimes been found in plantations of introduced pines, and has even bred in that habitat. This species is one of only two pittas that have been recorded feeding on open lawns in towns.

The species is <a href="Sedentism">sedentary</a>, most pairs occupying their <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> year-round. Some local movements to more marginal habitats have been recorded during the dry season. Its movements can be difficult to trace during the post-breeding season, as it is silent during the <a href="Moulting">annual moult</a>, and generally shy throughout the year. Young birds disperse from their parent's territories, seeking territories of their own. One <a href="bird%20ringing">banded</a> juvenile was discovered from its natural territory.

The rainbow pitta has several <a href="bird%20vocalisation">calls</a> and displays it uses to communicate with others of its kind. Males call significantly more than females, and a bird calls more during the breeding season. Over the course of a year a bird spends 12% of its day calling. Calling starts an hour before dawn, and is most frequent around dawn, and then at any time before 10 am and after 4 pm.

One common display is the bowing display, where the legs are held straight and the body held vertically, with the breast almost touching the ground. This display has only been observed being performed by males. During this display the pitta makes a purring sound made at no other time. This display is territorial, and is performed by neighbours along territorial boundaries, one bird displaying after another. The display and purring call are adapted to be noticeable in the dim light of the forest floor yet not so conspicuous so as to attract predators. The most commonly given call "teow-whit, teow-whit" or "choowip-choowip" is probably territorial as well.

A defensive behaviour of this species is wing-flicking, where the wings are half-opened for a second every five seconds. This behaviour is paired with a "keow" call, and is made when potential predators approach closely to a nest. It will also perform a wing-spreading display when predators are close to the nest, standing vertically and suddenly flashing open its wings. This behaviour may distract the attention of predators away from the nest. When an adult itself is threatened, it may adopt a ducking posture, holding its breast down to the ground and its tail up high.

Nesting pairs engage in a simple ritual when relieving their partner during incubation. The parent arriving will sit on a branch near the nest and issue a disyllabic whistle two or three times. On hearing this the incubating bird leaves without making a sound, and the relieving parent takes their place.

The rainbow pitta is unusual among the avifauna in its range for foraging exclusively on the ground. The diet of the rainbow pitta is dominated by insects and their larvae, other arthropods, snails and earthworms. Near Darwin, two thirds of the diet was earthworms; these are mostly taken during the rainy season from October to April. Insects and other arthropods are more commonly taken in the dry season; insects and arthropods taken include cockroaches, beetles, ants, caterpillars and grasshoppers, centipedes, spiders and millipedes. It will also take "<a href="Carpentaria">Carpentaria</a>" fruits that have fallen to the ground, as well as frogs and lizards.

The species forages individually by hopping on the forest floor, then pausing to scan; leaves and soil are scratched by the feet and leaves may be flicked away by the bill. When feeding on snails, it breaks them out of the shells using roots as an anvil. Unlike the noisy pitta, it only uses roots and branches as anvils, not stones. Larger prey like large centipedes are shaken and dropped, then the bird retreats for a few seconds before repeating the process.

The rainbow pitta is <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> during the breeding season, but does not form lifelong bonds. A pair may stay together the following year after breeding, but they are more likely to find new partners. Breeding in this species is seasonal, running from December through April. The first rains of the rainy season seem to be the trigger for nest building, as the breeding season seems to be correlated with the availability of earthworms, a major part of the diet of both nestlings and adults during this time.

Breeding territories vary in size from ; territories are larger in drier forest. Nesting sites are placed randomly through the pair's territory, although second nests in a year are placed some distance from nests used earlier that season. <a href="Bird%20nest">Nests</a> are not used more than once; if the pair lay a new clutch in a season then a new nest is constructed. Unlike the noisy pitta, which mostly places its nests close to the ground, the rainbow pitta only rarely places its nest close to the ground, possibly because its habitat floods more readily. It does place its nest anywhere from ground level up to up a tree, and the same pair can show similar variation in location within a nesting season. The nest can be placed in the fork of a tree, at the top of palms, on horizontal branches, in tangles of vines or against the buttress roots of tree.

A nest takes about a week to build, and is built by both parents. It starts as a platform of twigs, over which is built a dome. The enclosed nest is then lined with bark and leaves before a final lining of finer fibres, fern fronds and rootlets. One unusual feature of rainbow pitta nests, shared only with the noisy pitta in this family, is the addition of <a href="wallaby">wallaby</a> dung pellets to the entrance of the nest. In a study of 64 nests in the Northern Territory, 34% were decorated in this way. The function of the dung is uncertain; it has been suggested that the scent disguises the smell of eggs, nestlings or incubating adults from nest predators, but researchers found that decorated nests were preyed upon as frequently as clean nests. Entrances may also be decorated with other objects such as <a href="dingo">dingo</a> hair or feathers; the function of this is also unknown but may be to communicate with others of the same species. The nests of pittas may be domed to protect them from nest predators, but evidence of this in inconclusive. Nests are preyed upon by rodents and snakes, and nests are raided more often in monsoon forests than in eucalypt forests. Nesting failure is high for this species; 12% of nests are preyed upon in eucalypt forests and 60% of nests in monsoon forests.

An average clutch of rainbow pitta eggs contains four eggs, but some have three or five. The eggs are rounded and white with sepia spots and blotches and underlying grey markings. They measure on average. Both parents <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs for 14 days. Incubation stints last for an average of 87 minutes and the pair incubate their eggs for 90% of the daylight hours. The chicks are born naked, with black skin and yellow claws. Their eyes open after four days, and the down, when it comes in, is grey. Both parents feed the chicks, with an average time between feeds of just 7.5 minutes. Earthworms are broken up before being fed to smaller nestlings. Chicks fledge after 14 days, before they are fully grown. They continue to be fed for between 15 and 20 days after leaving the nest, after which they are independent of their parents, and may even be driven out of the territory by their parents. Having fledged one brood, some rainbow pittas may build a new nest and lay a second brood; in one study, two out of four closely studied pairs relaid. Pairs may even build the next nest while still feeding the previous brood.

The rainbow pitta is not thought to be in danger of extinction. It has a limited global distribution but is generally common throughout its range. In <a href="Kakadu%20National%20Park">Kakadu National Park</a> it is found in densities of one bird per . The Western Australian subspecies "P. i. johnstoneiana" may not be doing as well, as <a href="introduced%20species">feral cattle</a> destroy its habitat and seem to be causing some declines, although this subspecies is poorly known. Overall the rainbow pitta is evaluated as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List%20of%20Threatened%20Species">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>.

Dürer's Rhinoceros

Dürer's Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> executed by German painter and <a href="printmaker">printmaker</a> <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> in 1515. The image is based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an <a href="Indian%20Rhinoceros">Indian rhinoceros</a> that had arrived in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in 1515. Dürer never saw the actual <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>, which was the first living example seen in Europe since <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman times</a>. In late 1515, the King of Portugal, <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I</a>, sent the animal as a gift for <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a>, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named <a href="Abada%20%28rhinoceros%29">Abada</a>, arrived from India at the court of <a href="Sebastian%20of%20Portugal">Sebastian of Portugal</a> in 1577, being later inherited by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a> of Spain around 1580.

Dürer's woodcut is not an entirely accurate representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of <a href="armour">armour</a>, with a <a href="gorget">gorget</a> at the throat, a solid-looking <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a>, and <a href="rivet">rivet</a>s along the seams. He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features are present in a real rhinoceros, although the Indian rhinoceros does have deep folds in its skin that can look like armor from a distance. Despite its anatomical inaccuracies, Dürer's woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied many times in the following three centuries. It was regarded by Westerners as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century. Eventually, it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings, particularly those of <a href="Clara%20%28rhinoceros%29">Clara the rhinoceros</a>, who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s. It has been said of Dürer's woodcut: "probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts".

On 20 May 1515, an Indian rhinoceros arrived in Lisbon from the Far East. In early 1514, <a href="Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque">Afonso de Albuquerque</a>, governor of <a href="Portuguese%20India">Portuguese India</a>, sent ambassadors to <a href="Gujarat%20Sultanate">Sultan</a> <a href="Muzaffar%20Shah%20II">Muzaffar Shah II</a>, ruler of <a href="Cambay">Cambay</a> (modern <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>), to seek permission to build a fort on the island of <a href="Diu%2C%20India">Diu</a>. The mission returned without an agreement, but <a href="diplomatic%20gift">diplomatic gift</a>s were exchanged, including the rhinoceros. At that time, the rulers of different countries would occasionally send each other exotic animals to be kept in a <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>. The rhinoceros was already well accustomed to being kept in captivity. Albuquerque decided to forward the gift, known by its <a href="Gujarati%20language">Gujarati</a> name of "genda", and its Indian keeper, named Ocem, to King <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I of Portugal</a>. It sailed on the "Nossa Senhora da Ajuda", which left <a href="Goa">Goa</a> in January 1515. The ship, captained by Francisco Pereira Coutinho, and two companion vessels, all loaded with exotic <a href="spice">spice</a>s, sailed across the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, around the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> and north through the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, stopping briefly in <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> and the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>.

After a relatively fast voyage of 120 days, the rhinoceros was finally unloaded in Portugal, near the site where the <a href="Manueline">Manueline</a> <a href="Bel%C3%A9m%20Tower">Belém Tower</a> was under construction. The tower was later decorated with <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a>s shaped as rhinoceros heads under its <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s. A rhinoceros had not been seen in Europe since Roman times: it had become something of a <a href="mythical%20beast">mythical beast</a>, occasionally conflated in <a href="bestiary">bestiaries</a> with the "monoceros" (unicorn), so the arrival of a living example created a sensation. In the context of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, it was a piece of <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> which had been rediscovered, like a statue or an inscription.

The animal was examined by scholars and the curious, and letters describing the fantastic creature were sent to correspondents throughout Europe. The earliest known image of the animal illustrates a "poemetto" by Florentine <a href="Giovanni%20Giacomo%20Penni">Giovanni Giacomo Penni</a>, published in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> on 13 July 1515, fewer than eight weeks after its arrival in Lisbon. The only known copy of the original published poem is held by the <a href="Instituci%C3%B3n%20Colombina">Institución Colombina</a> in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>.

It was housed in King Manuel's menagerie at the <a href="Ribeira%20Palace">Ribeira Palace</a> in Lisbon, separate from his elephants and other large beasts at the <a href="Estaus%20Palace">Estaus Palace</a>. On <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity Sunday</a>, 3 June, Manuel arranged a fight with a young elephant from his collection, to test the account by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> that the elephant and the rhinoceros are bitter enemies. The rhinoceros advanced slowly and deliberately towards its foe; the elephant, unaccustomed to the noisy crowd that turned out to witness the spectacle, fled the field in panic before a single blow was struck. 
Manuel decided to give the rhinoceros as a gift to the <a href="Medici">Medici</a> <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a>. The King was keen to curry favour with the Pope, to maintain the papal grants of exclusive possession to the new lands that his naval forces had been exploring in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> since <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> discovered the sea route to India around Africa in 1498. The previous year, the Pope had been very pleased with Manuel's gift of a <a href="white%20elephant%20%28pachyderm%29">white elephant</a>, also from India, which the Pope had named <a href="Hanno%20%28elephant%29">Hanno</a>. Together with other precious gifts of silver plate and spices, the rhinoceros, with its new collar of green velvet decorated with flowers, embarked in December 1515 for the voyage from the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> to Rome. The vessel passed near <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> in early 1516. King <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> was returning from <a href="Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume">Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume</a> in <a href="Provence">Provence</a>, and requested a viewing of the beast. The Portuguese vessel stopped briefly at an island off Marseilles, where the rhinoceros disembarked to be beheld by the King on 24 January.

After resuming its journey, the ship was wrecked in a sudden storm as it passed through the narrows of <a href="Porto%20Venere">Porto Venere</a>, north of <a href="La%20Spezia">La Spezia</a> on the coast of <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>. The rhinoceros, chained and shackled to the deck to keep it under control, was unable to swim to safety and drowned. The carcass of the rhinoceros was recovered near <a href="Villefranche-sur-Mer">Villefranche</a>, and its hide was returned to Lisbon, where it was <a href="taxidermy">stuffed</a>. Some reports say that the mounted skin was sent to Rome, arriving in February 1516, to be exhibited "impagliato" (Italian for "stuffed with straw"), although such a feat would have challenged 16th-century methods of taxidermy, which were still primitive. If a stuffed rhinoceros did arrive in Rome, its fate remains unknown: it might have been removed to <a href="Florence">Florence</a> by the Medici, or destroyed in the 1527 <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%281527%29">sack of Rome</a>. In any event, there was not the popular sensation in Rome that the living beast had caused in Lisbon, although a rhinoceros was depicted in contemporary paintings in Rome by <a href="Giovanni%20da%20Udine">Giovanni da Udine</a> and <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>.

<a href="Valentim%20Fernandes">Valentim Fernandes</a>, a <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>n merchant and <a href="Printer%20%28publisher%29">printer</a>, saw the rhinoceros in Lisbon shortly after it arrived and described it in a newsletter sent to the <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> community of merchants in June 1515. The original document in German has not survived, but a transcript in Italian is held in the <a href="Biblioteca%20Nazionale%20Centrale%20Firenze">Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale</a> in Florence. A second letter of unknown authorship was sent from Lisbon to Nuremberg at around the same time, enclosing a sketch by an unknown artist. Dürer – who was acquainted with the Portuguese community of the <a href="Factory%20%28trading%20post%29">factory</a> at Antwerp – saw the second letter and sketch in Nuremberg. He made a <a href="pen%20and%20ink">pen and ink</a> drawing

The <a href="German%20language">German</a> inscription on the woodcut, drawing largely from Pliny's account, reads:

Dürer's woodcut is not an accurate representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of <a href="armour">armour</a>, with a <a href="gorget">gorget</a> at the throat, a solid-looking <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a>, and <a href="rivet">rivet</a>s along the seams. He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features is present in a real rhinoceros. It is possible that a <a href="suit%20of%20armour">suit of armour</a> was forged for the rhinoceros's fight against the elephant in Portugal, and that these features depicted by Dürer are parts of the armour. Alternatively, Dürer's "armour" may represent the heavy folds of thick skin of an Indian rhinoceros, or, as with the other inaccuracies, may simply be misunderstandings or creative additions by Dürer. Dürer also draws a scaly texture over the body of the animal, including the "armour". This may be Dürer's attempt to reflect the rough and almost hairless hide of the Indian rhinoceros, which has wart-like bumps covering its upper legs and shoulders. On the other hand, his depiction of the texture may represent <a href="dermatitis">dermatitis</a> induced by the rhinoceros' close confinement during the four-month journey by ship from India to Portugal.

A second woodcut was executed by <a href="Hans%20Burgkmair">Hans Burgkmair</a> in <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> around the same time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first <a href="State%20%28printmaking%29">state</a>, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.
The block passed into the hands of the Amsterdam printer and cartographer <a href="Willem%20Blaeu">Willem Janssen</a> (also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names). By this time the block was very damaged; the border lines were chipped, there were numerous <a href="woodworm">woodworm</a> holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino's legs. Janssen decided to re-issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours, olive-green and dark green, as well as blue-grey. The resulting "<a href="chiaroscuro%20woodcut">chiaroscuro woodcut</a>", which entirely omitted the text, was published after 1620. There is an example in the British Museum. This was the seventh of the eight editions in all of the print.
Despite its errors, the image remained very popular, and was taken to be an accurate representation of a rhinoceros until the late 18th century. Dürer may have anticipated this and deliberately chosen to create a woodcut, rather than a more refined and detailed <a href="engraving">engraving</a>, as this was cheaper to produce and more copies could be printed. Images derived from it were included in naturalist texts, including <a href="Sebastian%20M%C3%BCnster">Sebastian Münster</a>'s "Cosmographiae" (1544), <a href="Conrad%20Gessner">Conrad Gessner</a>'s "<a href="Historiae%20animalium%20%28Gesner%29">Historiae Animalium</a>" (1551), <a href="Edward%20Topsell">Edward Topsell</a>'s "Histoire of Foure-footed Beastes" (1607) and many others. A rhinoceros that was clearly based on Dürer's woodcut was chosen by <a href="Alessandro%20de%27%20Medici">Alessandro de' Medici</a> as his emblem in June 1536, with the motto "Non vuelvo sin vencer" (old Spanish for "I shall not return without victory"). A sculpture of a rhinoceros based on Dürer's image was placed at the base of a 70-foot (21 m) high <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> designed by <a href="Jean%20Goujon">Jean Goujon</a> and erected in front of the Church of the Sepulchre in the <a href="rue%20Saint-Denis%20%28Paris%29">rue Saint-Denis</a> in Paris in 1549 for the <a href="royal%20entry">royal entry</a> welcoming the arrival of the new King of France, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II</a>. A similar rhinoceros, in <a href="relief">relief</a>, decorates a panel in one of the bronze west doors of <a href="Pisa%20Cathedral">Pisa Cathedral</a>. The rhinoceros was depicted in numerous other paintings and sculptures, and became a popular decoration for <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>. The popularity of the inaccurate Dürer image remained undiminished despite an Indian rhinoceros spending eight years in Madrid from 1580 to 1588 (although a few examples of a print of the Madrid rhinoceros sketched by <a href="Philippe%20Galle">Philippe Galle</a> in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> in 1586, and derivative works, have survived), and the exhibition of a live rhinoceros in London a century later, from 1684–86, and of a second individual after 1739.

The pre-eminent position of Dürer's image and its derivatives declined from the mid-to-late-18th century, when more live rhinoceroses were transported to Europe, shown to the curious public, and depicted in more accurate representations. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Oudry">Jean-Baptiste Oudry</a> painted a life-size portrait of <a href="Clara%20the%20rhinoceros">Clara the rhinoceros</a> in 1749, and <a href="George%20Stubbs">George Stubbs</a> painted a large portrait of a rhinoceros in London around 1790. Both of these paintings were more accurate than Dürer's woodcut, and a more realistic conception of the rhinoceros gradually started to displace Dürer's image in the public imagination. In particular, Oudry's painting was the inspiration for a plate in <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Buffon</a>'s encyclopedic "Histoire naturelle", which was widely copied. In 1790, <a href="James%20Bruce">James Bruce</a>'s travelogue "Travels to discover the source of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>" dismissed Dürer's work as "wonderfully ill-executed in all its parts" and "the origin of all the monstrous forms under which that animal has been painted, ever since". Even so, Bruce's own illustration of the African <a href="White%20Rhinoceros">white rhinoceros</a>, which is noticeably different in appearance to the Indian rhinoceros, still shares conspicuous inaccuracies with Dürer's work. <a href="Semiotics">Semiotician</a> <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> argues (fetching the idea from E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1961) that Dürer's "scales and imbricated plates" became a necessary element of depicting the animal, even to those who might know better, because "they knew that only these conventionalized graphic signs could denote «rhinoceros» to the person interpreting the iconic sign." He also notes that the skin of a rhinoceros is rougher than it visually appears and that such plates and scales portray this non-visual information to a degree.

Until the late 1930s, Dürer's image appeared in school textbooks in Germany as a faithful image of the rhinoceros; and it remains a powerful artistic influence. It was one of the inspirations for <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>; a reproduction of the woodcut hung in his childhood home and he used the image in several of his works.

Although very popular, few prints have survived and impressions of the first edition are very rare. A fine example was sold at Christie's New York in 2013 for $866,500, setting a new auction record for the artist.

Jihad (song)

"Jihad" is a song by the American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> which appears on the band's 2006 studio album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>". The song portrays the imagined viewpoint of a terrorist who has participated in the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, concluding with spoken lyrics taken from words left behind by <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a>; Atta was named by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> as the "head suicide terrorist" of the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center. "Jihad" was primarily written by guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a>; the lyrics were co-authored with vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a>.

"Jihad" received a mixed reception in the music press, and reviews generally focused on the lyrics' controversial subject matter. The song drew comparisons to Slayer's 1986 track "<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>"—also penned by Hanneman—which similarly caused outrage at the time of its release.

Joseph Dias of the <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> Christian group "Catholic Secular Forum" expressed concern over "Jihad"'s lyrics, and contributed to "Christ Illusion"'s recall by <a href="EMI">EMI</a> India, who to date have no plans for a reissue in that country. <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC-TV</a>'s Broadcast Standards and Practices Department censored the song during Slayer's first US network television appearance on "<a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel%20Live%21">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>". Only the opening minute was broadcast over the show's credits, thus omitting 40% of the lyrics.

 Primarily written by guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a>, "Jihad" features lyrical contributions by vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a>. Both Hanneman and Araya had previously written about controversial lyrical matter in past Slayer tracks; while Hanneman had written songs like "<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>" and "SS-3" which explored the atrocities committed by Nazi figures such as Auschwitz concentration camp physician <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> and Third Reich henchman <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, Araya had delved into the lives of serial killers such as <a href="Jeffrey%20Dahmer">Jeffrey Dahmer</a> and <a href="Ed%20Gein">Ed Gein</a> in the tracks "213" and "Dead Skin Mask" respectively. "Jihad" is written from the perspective of a 9/11 terrorist, and imagines the thoughts that "the enemy" might have. The climax of the song features spoken text taken from a motivational letter left behind by <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a>, who was named by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> as the head suicide terrorist of <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, the first plane to crash into the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> in the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.

Guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> has been outspoken in his defense of "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the "coolest angle" on "Christ Illusion". "These new songs aren't political at all," King states, "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane'—it's what's spewing out at us from the TV." He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so. They did not wish to dwell on the topic "because every band on the planet already has" and "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint. "We're Slayer, we have to be different" was King's assertion.

American singer/songwriter <a href="Steve%20Earle">Steve Earle</a> attempted a similar concept in penning "John Walker's Blues" (from the 2002 album "<a href="Jerusalem%20%28Steve%20Earle%20album%29">Jerusalem</a>"), written from the perspective of the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>-born <a href="John%20Walker%20Lindh">John Walker Lindh</a>, a <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> member captured during the 2001 US-led <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">invasion of Afghanistan</a>. Earle was criticised for this track; King anticipated a comparable reaction to "Jihad": "People make an assumption before they (read) the lyrics. It's definitely not only human nature, it's very American-natured."

"Jihad" is played in standard 4/4 time and runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds. A skittering <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamp</a> played by Jeff Hanneman leads into the track, while Dave Lombardo shimmers his <a href="Hi-hat%20%28instrument%29">hi-hat</a>. Smoothly mixing up tempos, the band builds the song with a fast, "wonky, catchy and angular" <a href="guitar%20riff">guitar riff</a> reminiscent of the breakdown in 1986's "<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>".
This guitar riff decelerates before bursting forward again in two-bar stretches underpinned by Lombardo's pounding, fifth-gear drumming.

<a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewer Andy Patrizio was dismissive of the song's musical structure in comparison to other tracks on "Christ Illusion": "'Jihad,' 'Flesh Storm,' 'Skeleton Christ,' 'Supremist,' and felt there was too much similarity in the riffs, tuning, <a href="tempos">tempos</a>, and <a href="arrangements">arrangements</a>." MusicOMH.com's Ian Robinson was also negative, remarking that the song "concludes with the 'now getting slightly old hat' Slayer trick (but still atmospheric) of over sampling voices over the solo."

"Jihad"—alongside fellow "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>" album tracks "<a href="Eyes%20of%20the%20Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a>" and "Cult"—was made available for streaming on June 26, 2006, via the Spanish website "Rafabasa.com". The album was Slayer's ninth <a href="studio%20album">studio recording</a>, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews "Jihad" received a mixed reception.

"<a href="Blabbermouth.net">Blabbermouth</a>"s Don Kaye gave the opinion that "a handful of songs" on "Christ Illusion" "are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well", and specifically singled out the track: "I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'." Ben Ratliff of "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" remarked that the song is "predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than <a href="Martin%20Amis">Martin Amis</a>'s recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda." Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as:

Not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of "<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>" observed that "the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape." The "<a href="Austin%20Chronicle">Austin Chronicle</a>"'s Marc Savlov asked readers to "listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in 'Jihad,' with Araya playing the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly."

King would have appointed "Jihad" as the group's nomination in the "<a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a>" award category at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">49th Grammy Awards</a>, deeming the chosen track "<a href="Eyes%20of%20the%20Insane">Eyes of the Insane</a>" "the poorest representations" of the group on ninth studio album "Christ Illusion". Despite King's statement, "Eyes of the Insane" won Slayer their first Grammy award. The Slayer guitarist has also stated; "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so you can hear the fans go crazy about it and you can't always hear that at the beginning of a song."

"Jihad"'s lyrical matter provoked controversy from several quarters. Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" remarked that the song, "no doubt will be "Christ Illusion"'s most controversial track." In May 2006, "World Entertainment News Network" announced that revelations of the song's lyrical content had angered the families of <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">9/11</a> victims.

Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group "Catholic Secular Forum" (CSF) issued a memorandum to his police commissioner, in which he expressed concern that "Jihad" would offend "the sensibilities of the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s...and secular Indians who have respect for all faiths." EMI India met with the CSF, apologising for the album's release, and recalled all copies, with no plans for a reissue. On October 11, 2006, it was announced all stocks had been destroyed. The track, alongside the album's controversial <a href="Larry%20Carroll%20%28artist%29">Larry Carroll</a> painted cover art and provocative lyrics, were the specific reasons for EMI India's decision. Araya had expected "Jihad"'s treatment of the events of 9/11 to create a backlash in America, however it failed to materialise. This was in part, he believes, because of peoples' view that the song was merely "Slayer being Slayer". Hanneman expected that the Muslim community would either "embrace" or hate Slayer for penning the track, or that the victims of 9/11 would criticize the band over the song's subject matter.

"Jihad" was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC-TV</a>'s "<a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel%20Live%21">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>" (January 19, 2007), although only the opening minute of the track was broadcast. ABC-TV's Broadcast Standards and Practices department <a href="censorship">censored</a> "Jihad", and approached Slayer the day prior to broadcast with roughly 40% of the song lyrics deleted. King has since confirmed that the group were ten minutes from withdrawing from the show, but eventually decided to "just go do it."

On a number of occasions the song has been compared to "<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>", a Hanneman-penned Slayer track from 1986's "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>", which was lyrically inspired by Nazi physician <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>. "Angel of Death" focused on <a href="Nazi%20human%20experimentation">human experiments</a> conducted by Mengele at the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> in World War II. "KNAC.com"'s Peter Atkinson commented upon the similarities, to which King responded that the whole affair "was blown out of proportion".

Making the connection, King remembers thinking "Great, now we're gonna be answering for this one!" after listening to a playback of the song. "But as with 'Angel [of Death],' we're not endorsing anything. It's just not an 'anti' song, either." Hanneman emphasised, "Like 'Angel of Death,' it's just a documentary."

<doc id="6054939" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6054939" title="Eardwulf of Northumbria">
Eardwulf of Northumbria

Eardwulf (<a href="floruit">fl.</a> 790 – <a href="circa">c.</a> 830) was <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">king of Northumbria</a> from 796 to 806, when he was deposed and went into exile. He may have had a second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria in the last years of the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king <a href="%C3%86thelred%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelred I</a> attempted to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by <a href="Osbald%20of%20Northumbria">Osbald</a>: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.

Little is recorded of Eardwulf's family, though his father, also named Eardwulf, is known to have been a nobleman. Eardwulf was married by the time he became king, though his wife's name is not recorded. It is possible he later wed an illegitimate daughter of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>. In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had been one of those who killed King Æthelred. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. In 801, Eardwulf led an army against <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf</a> of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, perhaps because of Coenwulf's support for other claimants to the Northumbrian throne.

Eardwulf was deposed in 806 and according to a Frankish record, returned to his kingdom in 808. No record has survived of his death or the end of his reign: dates from 811 to 830 have been suggested. He was possibly buried at the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Hardulph%2C%20Breedon%20on%20the%20Hill">Mercian royal monastery</a> of <a href="Breedon%20on%20the%20Hill">Breedon on the Hill</a>, which carries a dedication to Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph, with whom Eardwulf is identified by several historians.

During the latter half of the eighth century, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Northumbrian</a> succession included a long series of murdered and deposed kings, as several royal lines contended for the throne. The main lines were those of <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Northumbria">Eadberht</a>, <a href="%C3%86thelwald%20Moll%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelwald Moll</a> and <a href="Alhred%20of%20Northumbria">Alhred</a>. In the eight years before Eardwulf's accession, all three of these dynastic lines were involved in the struggle for kingship: on 23 September 788, King <a href="%C3%86lfwald%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Ælfwald I</a>, grandson of Eadberht, was murdered by the "patricius" <a href="Sicga">Sicga</a> near Hexham, and Ælfwald's cousin <a href="Osred%20II%20of%20Northumbria">Osred</a> became king. Osred, who was of Alhred's line, was deposed after a year, and <a href="%C3%86thelred%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelred</a>, son of <a href="%C3%86thelwald%20Moll%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelwald Moll</a>, who had been deposed in 778 at a young age, was restored to the kingship, resuming the title Æthelred I.

Some Anglo-Saxon kings are known to have been killed by their households or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and <a href="Sigeberht%20of%20Wessex">Sigeberht of Wessex</a>. In both cases the decision is presented as that of some form of council.

This record of disputed succession was by no means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> and <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of <a href="Centwine%20of%20Wessex">Centwine</a> in 685 to <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a>'s seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may be true of Mercia from the death of <a href="Ceolred%20of%20Mercia">Ceolred</a> in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.

Kings did not rule alone, but rather governed together with the leading churchmen and nobles. While Northumbria lacks the body of <a href="charter">charter</a>s which shed light on the institutions of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of Northumbrian political life. The evidence for Northumbria survives largely in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> documents, and these use the words "dux" and "patricius" to describe the leading noblemen of the kingdom. The word "dux" is usually translated by the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word <a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a>. The historian Alan Thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding the title of "dux" in late Northumbria. The title "patricius" is usually translated as <a href="Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29">patrician</a>, which ultimately means noble, but in the latter days of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> represented a high-ranking position, second only to the emperor. The meaning of the title in Northumbria is unclear, but it appears that there was only one "patricius". While it may be simply an alternative to "dux", it might represent a position approximating to that of the <a href="Mayor%20of%20the%20Palace">Mayor of the Palace</a> in late <a href="Merovingian%20dynasty">Merovingian</a> <a href="Francia">Francia</a>.

The church in Northumbria was one of the major landowners, perhaps second only to the king. At the head of the Northumbrian church was the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, an office held by <a href="Eanbald%20%28died%20796%29">Eanbald I</a> to 796, <a href="Eanbald%20%28floruit%20798%29">Eanbald II</a> until some time after 808, and then by <a href="Wulfsige%20of%20York">Wulfsige</a> to around 830. Immediately below the archbishop were three bishops: the <a href="bishop%20of%20Lindisfarne">bishop of Lindisfarne</a>, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Hexham">bishop of Hexham</a> and the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Galloway">bishop of Whithorn</a>. The typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by their predecessors, with whom their relations might be difficult.

Northumbria's southern neighbour Mercia was, under the rule of kings <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Mercia">Æthelbald</a>, <a href="Offa%20of%20Mercia">Offa</a> and Coenwulf, the dominant kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. Offa, the greatest of the three, ruled Mercia until 796, followed soon after by Coenwulf. Offa's dominance was secured in part by marriage alliances with the other major kingdoms: <a href="Beorhtric%20of%20Wessex">Beorhtric of Wessex</a> and Æthelred of Northumbria were married to his daughters. Further afield, <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, the pre-eminent ruler in the Christian West, appears to have taken an active interest in Northumbrian affairs. Charlemagne initially ruled Francia and parts of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the <a href="Great%20Hungarian%20Plain">Great Hungarian Plain</a>. He was a staunch defender of the Papacy, and in the popes and the church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to Northumbria and beyond. Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.

Early evidence of friendly relations between Charlemagne and Offa is tempered by signs of strain. Charlemagne sheltered two exiles from England at his court: Odberht of Kent (probably <a href="Eadberht%20III%20Pr%C3%A6n">Eadberht Praen</a>) and <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert of Wessex</a>. Eadberht Praen ruled the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kingdom of Kent</a> for a short time after Offa's death, but was deposed by Coenwulf. Egbert was more successful, taking and holding the throne of Wessex in 802. It is clear that Mercian and Frankish interests could not always be reconciled and Frankish policy then moved towards support for Offa's opponents. To Charlemagne this primarily meant Northumbria: according to <a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a>, "Charlemagne ... saw England as if it were ruled by two kings only: Æthelred ruling Northumbria and Offa ruling everything to the south". Frankish support for Northumbria thus appears to have been driven by a desire to counter Mercian influence in southern Britain, an area with long-standing ties to Francia. It has also been suggested that Charlemagne's interest in Northumbria was motivated by a desire for co-operation against Viking raiders, who had first appeared in Northumbria in the early 790s. Alternatively it may be that Charlemagne's conception of the sphere of his authority included Britain, which had once been part of the Roman Empire.

Initially, both Charlemagne and Offa appear to have shared a common interest in supporting King Æthelred, Offa's son-in-law. Shortly before Æthelred was murdered in 796, an embassy from Francia delivered gifts for the king and his bishops. When Charlemagne learned of Æthelred's killing he was enraged, called the Northumbrians "that treacherous, perverse people...who murder their own lords", and threatened retribution. His ambassadors, who had travelled on to <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and were then returning home, were ordered back to Northumbria to recover the presents. Charlemagne in time became a supporter of Eardwulf. Eardwulf is said by the early 12th-century "Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham" to have married one of Charlemagne's daughters, information not found in other sources. If this is correct she must have been illegitimate, as the marriages of all the legitimate daughters are known. Coenwulf, on the other hand, who became king of Mercia shortly after Eardwulf's accession, is recorded as having fought with Eardwulf in 801.

Eardwulf was not, so far as is known, connected to any of the factions that had been warring for the throne up to the mid-790s. Nothing is definitely known of his background, though <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>'s "History of the Kings", an early twelfth-century work based on the lost late tenth-century chronicle of <a href="Byrhtferth">Byrhtferth</a>, records that his father's name was also Eardwulf, and both father and son are given the title "dux". Historian <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a> has proposed that he was a descendant of one Eanwine who (according to Symeon of Durham) was killed in 740 on the orders of King Eadberht. This Eanwine may be identified with King <a href="Eadwulf%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Eadwulf</a>'s son of the same name. Eardwulf's father may have been one of the two Eardwulfs whose deaths are recorded by Symeon of Durham in 774 and 775.

Eardwulf appears to have been an enemy of Æthelred I. He first appears in the historical record <a href="circa">circa</a> 790, when Symeon of Durham reports that:"Eardulf was taken prisoner, and conveyed to <a href="Ripon%20Cathedral">Ripon</a>, and there ordered by the aforesaid king [Æthelred] to be put to death without the gate of the monastery. The brethren carried his body into the church with <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>ing, and placed it out of doors in a tent; after midnight he was found alive in the church." A letter from <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> to Eardwulf suggests that this fortunate recovery was seen as being miraculous.

Eardwulf's whereabouts after his recovery are not known. In surviving King Æthelred's anger he was more fortunate than Ælfwald's sons, who were drowned on Æthelred's orders in 791. Osred returned from exile but was betrayed, and killed by Æthelred's command on 14 September 792. Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at <a href="Corbridge">Corbridge</a>, by conspirators led by the "dux" Ealdred. Æthelred was followed as king by <a href="Osbald%20of%20Northumbria">Osbald</a>, whose antecedents are unknown: he was deposed after twenty-seven days and fled to the land of the <a href="Picts">Picts</a> with a few supporters.

Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" records that he was consecrated by <a href="Eanbald%20I">Eanbald I</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, and Bishops <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Whithorn">Æthelberht</a>, <a href="Beadwulf">Beadwulf</a> and <a href="Higbald%20of%20Lindisfarne">Hygebald</a>, at <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> on 26 May 796.

Eardwulf was evidently married before he became king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a concubine soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop <a href="Eanbald%20II">Eanbald II</a>—Eanbald I had died in the year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.

Although Æthelred had been Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers proved to be equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a "dux" named Wada, who was one of those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near <a href="Whalley%2C%20Lancashire">Whalley, Lancashire</a>. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The evidence for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.

Two further challenges to Eardwulf are recorded within the next two years, both apparently from among the noble lines that had been fighting for the throne over the previous decades. In 799, a "dux" named Moll was killed by Eardwulf's "urgent command". Moll's name has suggested that he was a kinsman of the late King Æthelred, whose father was <a href="%C3%86thelwald%20Moll">Æthelwald Moll</a>. The following year, <a href="Alchmund%20of%20Derby">Ealhmund</a>, "the son of King Alhred, as some say", was killed by Eardwulf's men. Ealhmund was remembered at <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, in the neighbouring kingdom of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, as a saint.

King <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf of Mercia</a> may have supported the unfortunate Ealhmund, and Symeon of Durham wrote that in 801:"Eardwulf, king of the Northumbrians, led an army against Coenwulf, king of Mercians, because he had given asylum to his enemies. He also, collecting an army, obtained very many auxiliaries from other provinces, having made a long expedition among them. At length, with the advice of the bishops and chiefs of the Angles on either side, they made peace through the kindness of the king of the Angles."

This settlement ended open warfare, but Eardwulf was deposed in 806, in unknown circumstances. Letters between Charlemagne and <a href="Pope%20Leo%20III">Pope Leo III</a> suggest that Coenwulf had a hand in Eardwulf's removal. According to the thirteenth-century chronicler <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>, Eardwulf was replaced by King <a href="%C3%86lfwald%20II%20of%20Northumbria">Ælfwald II</a>, about whom nothing else is known from the written sources, although coins issued in his reign have survived.

As the case of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological evidence from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the <a href="mint%20%28facility%29">mint</a> where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names <a href="York">York</a> as the place of issue—and the <a href="moneyer">moneyer</a> who produced them. Their weight and <a href="silver">silver</a> content can be compared with other reigns, providing a hint of the prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are compared with those of neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art. The evidence of Northumbrian coinage is particularly valuable in the ninth century, when contemporary written evidence all but disappears.

From the 740s until the end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, although in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son <a href="Eanred%20of%20Northumbria">Eanred</a>.

Like many of his predecessors, Eardwulf took to exile when he was deposed. Unlike kings with ties to <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, who appear to have chosen exile among the Picts, Eardwulf was linked to Ripon and chose a southerly exile. The next reports of Eardwulf are in Frankish sources:"Meanwhile the king of the Northumbrians from the island of Britain, Eardwulf by name, being expelled from his kingdom and native land, came to the emperor while he was still at <a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, and after he had made known the reason for his coming, he set out for Rome; and on his return from Rome he was escorted by envoys of the Roman pontiff and of the lord emperor back into his kingdom. At that time <a href="Pope%20Leo%20III">Leo III</a> ruled over the Roman church, and his messenger, the deacon Ealdwulf from that same Britain, a Saxon by race, was sent to Britain, and with him two abbots, Hruotfrid the notary and Nantharius of <a href="Saint-Omer">St. Omer</a>, sent by the emperor."

A surviving letter of Leo III to Charlemagne confirms that Eardwulf visited Rome and stayed at Charlemagne's court.

The Frankish source is clear that Eardwulf was "returned to his kingdom", but surviving Anglo-Saxon sources have no record of a second reign. Historians disagree as to whether Ælfwald was replaced by Eardwulf, who would thus have reigned a second time from 808 to 811 or 812, or whether the reign of Eardwulf's son <a href="Eanred%20of%20Northumbria">Eanred</a> began in 808.

Recent studies, based on the discovery of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it is argued that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, <a href="%C3%86thelred%20II%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelred II</a> from 854 to 862, <a href="R%C3%A6dwulf%20of%20Northumbria">Rædwulf</a> in 858, and <a href="Osberht%20of%20Northumbria">Osberht</a> from 862 to 867.
Eardwulf is identified by historians with the Saint Hardulph or Hardulf, to whom the Mercian royal church of <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Hardulph%2C%20Breedon%20on%20the%20Hill">Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph</a> at <a href="Breedon%20on%20the%20Hill">Breedon on the Hill</a> is dedicated. The connection, though unproven, has been made by several historians and is uncontroversial. Supporting evidence comes from a twelfth-century list of the burial places of saints compiled at <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a>. This calls the Saint Hardulph to whom Breedon was dedicated ""Hardulfus rex""—King Eardwulf—and states that he was buried at Breedon.

A panelled stone structure in the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the "<a href="Book%20of%20Cerne">Book of Cerne</a>", a work associated with Bishop <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Lichfield">Æthelwold of Lichfield</a> (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> built to hold the remains of a high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in the "Book of Cerne" to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.

The death of Eardwulf is not recorded. Although he had faced considerable opposition and had been driven into exile, he succeeded in founding a dynasty. His son Eanred and grandson <a href="%C3%86thelred%20II%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelred</a> (II) ruled Northumbria for most of its remaining existence as an independent kingdom.

Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion

Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 <a href="triptych">triptych</a> painted by the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20people">Irish-born British</a> artist <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>. The canvasses are based on the <a href="Erinyes">Eumenides</a>—or Furies—of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>'s "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>", and depict three writhing <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> creatures set against a flat <a href="Shades%20of%20orange%23Burnt%20orange">burnt orange</a> background. It was executed in <a href="oil%20paint">oil paint</a> and <a href="oil%20pastel">pastel</a> on Sundeala <a href="fibre%20board">fibre board</a> and completed within two weeks. The triptych summarises themes explored in Bacon's previous work, including his examination of <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>'s <a href="Biomorphism">biomorphs</a> and his interpretations of the <a href="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> and the Greek Furies. Bacon did not realise his original intention to paint a large crucifixion scene and place the figures at the foot of the cross.

The "Three Studies" are generally considered Bacon's first mature piece; he regarded his works before the triptych as irrelevant, and throughout his life tried to suppress their appearance on the art market. When the painting was first exhibited in 1945 it caused a sensation and established him as one of the foremost post-war painters. Remarking on the cultural significance of "Three Studies", the critic <a href="John%20Russell%20%28art%20critic%29">John Russell</a> observed in 1971 that "there was painting in England before the Three Studies, and painting after them, and no one ... can confuse the two".

As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the <a href="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including <a href="wiktionary%3Adiaphanous">diaphanous</a> forms, flat backgrounds, and <a href="Surrealism">surrealist</a> props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are "aesthetically pleasing", they lack "a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings "suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.

When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on "Oresteia". He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in "Crucifixion, 1933". "Three Studies" was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, "I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a> in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.

Although he had been painting for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that "Three Studies" was the "<a href="fons%20et%20origo">fons et origo</a>" of his career. He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was emphatic that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, and most of the early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.

The panels of "Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion" are painted on light <a href="Sundeala">Sundeala</a> boards, a material Bacon was using at the time as an inexpensive alternative to <a href="canvas">canvas</a>. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, due in part to the low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.
The art critic Hugh Davies has suggested that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop of dark hair. Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.

The central figure's mouth is positioned directly on its neck, rather than on a distinct face. It bares its teeth as if in a snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from <a href="Matthias%20Gr%C3%BCnewald">Matthias Grünewald</a>'s "Mocking of Christ". This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating from the base of the pedestal.

Situated on an isolated patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester has suggested that it may be yawning. Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, "Untitled, c. 1943", which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.

Inspection under <a href="infrared">infrared</a> has revealed that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.

Bacon said in a 1959 letter that the figures in "Three Studies" were "intended to [be] use[d] at the base of a large Crucifixion which I may still do." By this, Bacon implied that the figures were conceived as a <a href="predella">predella</a> to a larger <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>. The biographer <a href="Michael%20Peppiatt">Michael Peppiatt</a> has suggested that the panels may have emerged as single works, and that the idea of combining them as a triptych came later. There is little in the themes or styles of the three panels to suggest that they were originally conceived as a whole. Though they share the same orange background, Bacon had already used this colour in two prior pieces; moreover, his "oeuvre" can be characterized by periods that are dominated by a single background colour. From the beginning of his career, Bacon preferred to work in series and found that his imagination was stimulated by sequences; as he put it, "images breed other images in me."

The Crucifixion itself is conspicuously absent, and there is no trace or shadow of its presence in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from <a href="Picasso">Picasso</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20Picasso%20artworks%201921-1930">late 1920s</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Picasso%20artworks%201931-1940">mid-1930s</a> pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's "The Bathers" (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from <a href="Matthias%20Gr%C3%BCnewald">Matthias Grünewald</a>'s "Mocking of Christ".

"Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion" is a key precursor to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and the theme of the Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his "oeuvre". It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.

Although Bacon stated that he modelled the creatures on the Furies, the visual link to the sources is barely perceptible in his finished work. The mood and tone of the painting, however, is consistent with the agonized spirit of the Furies' legend. They are traditionally depicted as ancient <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> deities preoccupied with avenging patricide and matricide by hunting down and killing violent criminals. In Aeschylus' "<a href="The%20Oresteia">The Oresteia</a>", the title character is pursued by the Furies in revenge for the murder of his mother <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a>. The saga tells the story of the decimation of the line of <a href="Atreus">Atreus</a>; Clytemnestra had hacked to death her husband <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, and later slew <a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, who had foreseen the murders and declared: "Drunken, drunken with blood / To make them dare the more, a reveling rout / Is in the rooms which no man shall cast out, of sister Furies."

Bacon did not seek to illustrate the narrative of the tale, however. He told the French art critic <a href="Michel%20Leiris">Michel Leiris</a>, "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as that would have been merely another kind of historical painting ... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." Aeschylus' phrase "the reek of human blood smiles out at me" in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him "the most exciting images, and I often read it ... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the reek of human blood smiles out at me', well what could be more amazing than that."

Bacon was introduced to Aeschylus through <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s 1939 play "<a href="The%20Family%20Reunion">The Family Reunion</a>", in which the protagonist Harry is haunted by "the sleepless hunters / that will not let me sleep". In Eliot's play, the Furies serve as embodiments of the remorse and guilt felt by Harry, who harbours a dark family secret, shared only with his sister. Bacon was captivated by Aeschylus' play, and keen to learn more about <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a>, although he said many times that he regretted being unable to read the original in Greek. In 1942, he read the Irish scholar <a href="William%20Bedell%20Stanford">William Bedell Stanford</a>'s "Aeschylus in his Style", and found the theme of obsessive guilt in "The Oresteia" to be highly resonant. In 1984, Bacon told Sylvester that although his painting's subject matter did not have a direct relationship with the poet's work, for him Eliot's work "opened the valves of sensation".

The mouth of the triptych's central figure was also inspired by the nurse's scream in film director <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s <a href="Odessa%20Steps">Odessa Steps</a> massacre sequence in "<a href="The%20Battleship%20Potemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a>" (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster <a href="Melvyn%20Bragg">Melvyn Bragg</a> confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a <a href="South%20Bank%20Show">South Bank Show</a> documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, "I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a <a href="Monet">Monet</a> landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it."

Other than in Picasso's exploration of the theme, the Crucifixion did not figure prominently in twentieth-century painting. The Surrealists exploited its shock value, and it was used as a vehicle for blasphemy in isolated instances. Bacon often expressed his admiration for the manner in which old masters such as <a href="Cimabue">Cimabue</a> treated the Crucifixion; however, as with Picasso, he was more interested in tackling the subject from a secular, humanist point of view. For "Three Studies", Bacon did not approach the Crucifixion as a Christian image "per se", but rather found that the scene reflected a particular view of humanity he held. As he told David Sylvester: "it was just an act of man's behaviour, a way of behaviour to another."

The <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a> of Christ became a central concern during the early development of Bacon's work, and he returned to the subject throughout his career. When asked by critic Jean Clair why his Crucifixion scenes tended to comprise mainly "slaughter, butchery, mutilated meat and flesh", Bacon replied, "that's all the Crucifixion was, isn't it? ... Actually, you can't think of anything more barbaric than the Crucifixion, and that particular way of killing somebody." While "Three Studies" may have begun as an attempt to directly represent the Crucifixion scene, his explorations led him towards "something completely different". Bacon came to regard the scene as an <a href="Armature%20%28sculpture%29">armature</a> for exploring new ways of representing human behaviours and emotions. For him it amounted to a kind of self-portraiture; a vehicle for working on "all sorts of very private feelings about behaviour and about the way life is".

Coming in 1944, the triptych was often thought to be informed by the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Art critic Ziva Amishai-Maisseles observes that the canvas reflects Bacon's own confusion and ambivalence "towards manifestations of violence and power, both of which attracted and repulsed him simultaneously."

"Three Studies" was first shown at a joint exhibition at the <a href="Lefevre%20Gallery">Lefevre Gallery</a>, London, in April 1945, alongside work by <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a> and <a href="Graham%20Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a>. Bacon was then unknown and it is likely that his painting was included at the request of Sutherland, his close friend at the time. The Lefevre exhibition coincided with the final days of <a href="World%20War%20Two">World War Two</a> in Europe, and John Russell has observed that the immediate post-war period in British history was marked by an atmosphere of nostalgia and optimism—a sense that "everything was going to be alright, and visitors went into the Lefevre in a spirit of thanksgiving for perils honourably surmounted."

Both the public and critics were unnerved by the sight of the work. Russell describes being shocked by "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." Writing for "<a href="Apollo%20%28magazine%29">Apollo</a>" magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition. Perhaps it was the red [sic] background that made me think of "entrails", of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish". The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.

Reviewing for the "New Statesman and Nation", <a href="Raymond%20Mortimer">Raymond Mortimer</a> wrote that the panels "seems served from Picasso's Crucifixion [1930], but further distorted, with ostrich necks and button heads protruding from bags—the whole effect gloomily phallic, like <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Bosch</a> without the humour. These objects are perched on stools, and depicted as if they were sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [to me] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror in the sense that it is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence."

Irish author <a href="Colm%20T%C3%B3ib%C3%ADn">Colm Tóibín</a> noted in 2006 that the triptych has retained its "genuinely startling" impact. Matthew Kieran wrote, in his 2005 essay on the painting, that "these frightened, blind, raging figures are visceral in their impact, jolting one into sensations of fright, horror, isolation and angst. We react to them as self-conscious creatures, their postures and expressions revealing feelings of petrified isolation, searing horror, pain and blind confusion." As of 2007, "Three Studies" is part of the <a href="Tate">Tate Gallery</a>'s permanent collection, having been donated by Bacon's lover Eric Hall in 1953.

Bacon often created second versions of his major paintings. In 1988, he completed a near-copy of the original "Three Studies". With each panel at 78 × 58 inches (198 × 147 cm), this <a href="Second%20Version%20of%20Triptych%201944">second version</a> is more than twice the size of the original, and the orange background has been replaced by a blood-red hue. The figures occupy a smaller proportion of the canvas than those of the 1944 version, a device which, according to the Tate Gallery's catalogue, "plung[es] them into a deep void".

Critical opinion was mixed; the 1988 triptych drew criticism from those who felt that its more refined painting technique robbed the image of much of its power. Denis Farr suggested that while the second version's larger scale gave it "a majestic quality which is highly effective", its svelte presentation lessened its shock value. Critic Jonathan Meades felt that while the 1988 triptych was a more polished and painterly work, it lacked the rawness of the original.

Reflecting on Bacon's tendency to revisit subject matter, Meades observed that "Bacon's auto-plagiarism in areas other than portraiture had less deleterious consequences. Nonetheless the 1988 version (or near copy) of the great 1944 Crucifixion Triptych is the lesser work: it is slicker, more polished and it evinces a greater ease with paint. The backgrounds are now elaborated, defined and bereft of the garish, grating poison orange of 1944." The art critic James Demetrion found that despite these differences, the second version still achieves the power and impact of the first.

Jocelin of Glasgow

Jocelin (or Jocelyn) (died 1199) was a twelfth-century <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian monk</a> and <a href="cleric">cleric</a> who became the fourth <a href="Abbot%20of%20Melrose">Abbot of Melrose</a> before becoming <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. He was probably born in the 1130s, and in his teenage years became a monk of <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a>. He rose in the service of <a href="Waltheof%20of%20Melrose">Abbot Waltheof</a>, and by the time of the short abbacy of Waltheof's successor Abbot William, Jocelin had become <a href="prior">prior</a>. Then in 1170 Jocelin himself became abbot, a position he held for four years. Jocelin was responsible for promoting the cult of the emerging <a href="Saint%20Waltheof">Saint Waltheof</a>, and in this had the support of <a href="Enguerrand%20%28Bishop%20of%20Glasgow%29">Enguerrand</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a>.

His Glasgow connections and political profile were already well-established enough that in 1174 Jocelin succeeded Enguerrand as Glasgow's bishop. As Bishop of Glasgow, he was a royal official. In this capacity he travelled abroad on several occasions, and performed the marriage ceremony between King <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William the Lion</a> and <a href="Ermengarde%20de%20Beaumont">Ermengarde de Beaumont</a>, later <a href="baptism">baptising</a> their son, the future King <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a>. Among other things, he has been credited by modern historians as "the founder of the <a href="burgh">burgh</a> of <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and initiator of the <a href="Glasgow%20Fair">Glasgow fair</a>", as well as being one of the greatest literary patrons in <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages">medieval Scotland</a>, commissioning the "Life of St Waltheof", the "Life of St Kentigern" and the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose</a>".

Jocelin and his family probably came from the south-east of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The names of neither his father nor his mother are known, but he had two known brothers, with the names Helia and Henry, and a cousin, also called Helia. The names suggest that his family were of <a href="French%20people">French</a>, or at least <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> origin, rather than being a <a href="Gaels">Scot</a> or native <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a>. There are some indications that his family held land in <a href="South%20Lanarkshire">South Lanarkshire</a>, namely because they seem to have possessed rights in the church of <a href="Dunsyre">Dunsyre</a>. It is unlikely that he would have thought of himself as "Scottish". For Jocelin's contemporary and fellow native of the Borders, <a href="Adam%20of%20Dryburgh">Adam of Dryburgh</a>, this part of <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a> was still firmly regarded as "terra Anglorum" (the "Land of English"), although it was located inside the "regnum Scottorum" (the "Kingdom of the Scots"). This would be no obstacle to Jocelin, however. His Anglo-French cultural background was in fact probably necessary for the patronage of the King of Scots. As <a href="Walter%20of%20Coventry">Walter of Coventry</a> wrote of King William's era, "the modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude".
Like that of almost every character from this period, Jocelin's year of birth is unknown to modern historians. It is known that he entered as a novice monk in <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a> during the abbacy of <a href="Waltheof%20of%20Melrose">Waltheof</a> (ab. 1148–1159), and from documentary evidence it seems likely that Jocelin entered Melrose about 50 years before his death in 1199. As the rules of the Cistercian order prevented entry as a <a href="Catholic%20novitiate">novice</a> before the age of 15, it is likely that he was born around the year 1134. Little is known about Jocelin's early life or his early career as a Melrose monk. He obviously successfully completed his one-year noviciate, the year in which a prospective monk was introduced to monasticism and judged fit or unfit for admittance. We know that Abbot Waltheof (Waldef) thought highly of him and granted him many responsibilities. After the death of Abbot Waltheof, his successor, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours which had quickly been spreading about Waltheof's <a href="saint">saint</a>liness. Abbot William attempted to silence such rumours, and shelter his monks from the intrusiveness of would-be <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a>s. However, William was unable to get the better of Waltheof's emerging cult, and his actions had alienated him from the brethren. As a result, William resigned the abbacy in April 1170. Jocelin was by this stage the <a href="Prior">Prior</a> of Melrose, that is, the second in command at the monastery, and thus William's most likely replacement.

So it was that Prior Jocelin became abbot on 22 April 1170. Jocelin embraced the cult without hesitation. Under the year of his accession, it was reported in the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose</a>" that:

Promoting saints was something Jocelin would repeat at Glasgow, where he "transferred his enthusiasm to <a href="Saint%20Mungo">St Kentigern</a>" and commissioned a <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> of that saint, the saint most venerated by the Celts of the diocese of Glasgow. It is no coincidence that <a href="Jocelin%20of%20Furness">Jocelin of Furness</a>, the man who wrote the "Life of St. Waltheof", was the same man later commissioned to write the "Life of St. Kentigern".

This kind of literary patronage started while Jocelin was abbot of Melrose. <a href="Archie%20Duncan%20%28historian%29">Archie Duncan</a> has shown that it was probably Jocelin who first commissioned the writing of the "Chronicle of Melrose". Duncan argued that Jocelin commissioned the entries dealing with the period between 731 and 1170, putting the writing in the hands of a monk named Reinald (who later became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ross%20%28Scotland%29">Bishop of Ross</a>). This chronicle is one of the few extant chronicles from "Scotland" in this period. <a href="G.%20W.%20S.%20Barrow">G. W. S. Barrow</a>, writing before Duncan advanced these arguments, noted that down to the end of King William's reign "the chronicle of Melrose Abbey ... represents a strongly 'Anglo-Norman' as opposed to a native Scottish point of view". It is thus possible that this anti-Scottish world-view reflected that of Jocelin's, at least before he left the abbey.

After his election to the prestigious bishopric of Glasgow in 1174, Jocelin would continue exerting influence on his home monastery. Jocelin brought one of his monks from the abbey, a man called Michael, who acted as Jocelin's <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> while Bishop of Glasgow. He did not resign his position as abbot until after his consecration in 1175. Jocelin consecrated his successors as abbot, and continued to spend a great deal of time there. Moreover, he used his position as bishop to offer the monastery patronage and protection.

 After the death of his friend Bishop <a href="Enguerrand%20%28Bishop%20of%20Glasgow%29">Enguerrand</a>, Jocelin was elevated to the bishopric of Glasgow. He was elected on 23 May 1174. The election, like many other Scottish <a href="episcopal%20polity">episcopal</a> elections of the period, was done in the presence of the king, <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William the Lion</a>, at <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, near <a href="Scone%2C%20Scotland">Scone</a>, the chief residence of Scotland's kings. The election was probably done by "compromissarii", meaning that the general <a href="chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a> of the bishopric of Glasgow had selected a small group to which they delegated the power of election. <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> was later told that Jocelin was elected by the <a href="dean%20%28religion%29">dean</a> and chapter of the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>. The "Chronicle of Melrose" states that he was elected "by demand of the clergy, and of the people; and with the consent of the king himself", perhaps indicating that the decision had already been made by the Glasgow clergy before the formal election at Perth. The election was certainly an achievement. Cistercian bishops were rare in Great Britain, and Jocelin was only the second Cistercian to ascend a Scottish bishopric. Jocelin was required to go to France to obtain permission from the General Chapter of the Cistercian order at <a href="C%C3%AEteaux%20Abbey">Cîteaux</a> to resign the abbacy. Pope Alexander III had already sanctioned his consecration, and gave permission for the consecration to occur without forcing Jocelin to travel to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Conveniently, it was at Cistercian house of <a href="Clairvaux%20Abbey">Clairvaux</a> that, sometime before 15 March 1175, Jocelin was consecrated by the <a href="Papal%20legate">Papal legate</a> <a href="Eskil%20of%20Lund">Eskil</a>, <a href="List%20of%20bishops%20of%20Lund">Archbishop of Lund</a> and <a href="primate%20%28bishop%29">Primate</a> of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. Jocelin had returned to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> by 10 April, and it is known that on 23 May he had consecrated a monk named Laurence as his successor at Melrose.
He was soon faced with a political challenge to the independence of his church. The challenge came from the English church, and was not new, but had lain dormant for some decades. The reason it was awakened was that in the summer of 1174 King William had invaded northern England, and on 13 July, having been caught underprotected during a siege at <a href="Alnwick">Alnwick</a>, was captured and taken into English custody. The capture was disastrous for the king, leading to a revolt by <a href="Gille%20Brigte%2C%20Lord%20of%20Galloway">Gilla Brigte, Lord of Galloway</a>, and to many of William's discontented subjects "ruthlessly" slaying "their English and French neighbours" and perpetrating a "most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a>", that is, of the English and French-speaking settlers William and his predecessors had planted around the castles and towns of his <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Gaelic</a>-speaking territories in order to increase royal authority. Worse still, and more significantly for Jocelin, in the following year King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> forced William to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Falaise">Treaty of Falaise</a>, a treaty which made William Henry's vassal specifically for Scotland and sanctioned the subordination of the kingdom's bishoprics to the English church.

Jocelin did not, in the end, submit either to the <a href="Roger%20de%20Pont%20L%27Ev%C3%AAque">Archbishop of York</a> or even the <a href="Richard%20of%20Dover">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and managed to obtain a <a href="Papal%20Bull">Papal Bull</a> which declared the see of Glasgow to be a "special daughter" of the Roman <a href="Patriarchate">Patriarchate</a>. Jocelin, moreover, does not seem to have been interested in the independence of the other "Scottish" sees, but merely to maintain his own episcopal independence, i.e. that of the bishopric of Glasgow. On 10 August 1175, along with many other Scottish-based magnates and prelates, Jocelin was at Henry's court giving his obedience to the king as stipulated in the treaty. Jocelin again appeared at King Henry's court in January 1176. This time church matters were on the agenda. When the Archbishop of York confronted Jocelin over the subordination of the bishopric of Glasgow to the archbishopric of York, Jocelin refused to acknowledge this part of the treaty, and presented him with the Papal Bull declaring Glasgow to be a "special daughter".

This Bull was confirmed by Pope Alexander's successor <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20III">Pope Lucius III</a>. Jocelin had obtained this confirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and early 1182. He had been sent there by King William, along with abbots of Melrose, <a href="Abbot%20of%20Dunfermline">Dunfermline</a> and <a href="Abbot%20of%20Kelso">Kelso</a> and the prior of <a href="Abbot%20of%20Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a>, in order to appeal to the Pope regarding his stance in a struggle over the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">Bishopric of St Andrews</a> and the sentence of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> and <a href="interdict">interdict</a> the Pope had placed over the king and kingdom. The dispute concerned the election to the bishopric of <a href="John%20the%20Scot%20%28bishop%20of%20Dunkeld%29">John the Scot</a>, which had been opposed by the king, who organised the election of his own candidate, <a href="Hugh%20the%20Chaplain">Hugh</a>. The mission was successful. The Pope lifted the interdict, absolved the king and appointed two legates to investigate the issue of the St Andrews succession. The Pope even sent the king a <a href="Golden%20Rose">Golden Rose</a>, an item usually given to the <a href="Prefect">Prefect</a> of Rome. The issue of the succession, however, did not go away. In 1186, Jocelin, along with the abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and <a href="Newbattle%20Abbey">Newbattle</a>, excommunicated Hugh on the instructions of Pope Lucius. Hugh travelled to Rome in 1188, and obtained absolution, but he died of the pestilence in that city a few days later, thus allowing the issue to be resolved.
It is certainly obvious that Jocelin was one of the most respected figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between <a href="Arbroath%20Abbey">Arbroath Abbey</a> and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between <a href="Jedburgh%20Abbey">Jedburgh Abbey</a> and <a href="Dryburgh%20Abbey">Dryburgh Abbey</a>. Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by <a href="David%20of%20Scotland%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">David, Earl of Huntingdon</a> (the brother of King William), <a href="Donnchadh%2C%20Earl%20of%20Carrick">Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick</a>, and <a href="Alan%20fitz%20Walter%2C%202nd%20High%20Steward%20of%20Scotland">Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland</a>. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Oxfordshire">Woodstock</a> near <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> to marry <a href="Ermengarde%20de%20Beaumont">Ermengarde de Beaumont</a> on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a>, it was Jocelin who performed the <a href="baptism">baptism</a>. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.

His years at Glasgow left a mark on history that can be compared favourably with any previous or future bishop. Jocelin commissioned his namesake Jocelin of Furness, the same man who had written the "Life of St. Waltheof", to write a "Life of St. Kentigern", a task all the more necessary because, after 1159, the Papacy claimed the right to <a href="canonization">canonise</a> saints. Kentigern, or Mungo as he is popularly known, was the saint traditionally associated with the see of Glasgow, and his status therefore reflected on Glasgow as a church and cult-centre. There had already been a cathedral at Glasgow before Jocelin's episcopate. The idea that the ecclesiastical establishment before Jocelin was simply a small church with a larger Gaelic or British monastic establishment has been discredited by scholars. Jocelin did, though, expand the cathedral significantly. As the "Chronicle of Melrose" reports for 1181, Jocelin "gloriously enlarged the church of St Kentigern". However, more work was created for the builders when, sometime between the years 1189 and 1195, there was a fire at the cathedral. Jocelin thus had to commission another rebuilding effort. The new cathedral was dedicated, according to the "Chronicle of Melrose", on 6 July 1197. It was built in the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> manner, and although little survives of it today, it is thought to have been influenced by the <a href="Lund%20Cathedral">cathedral of Lund</a>, the archbishop of which had consecrated Jocelin as bishop.

However, he left a still greater legacy to the city of Glasgow. At some point between the years 1175 and 1178, Jocelin obtained from King William a grant of <a href="royal%20burgh">burghal status</a> for the settlement of Glasgow, with a market every Thursday. The grant of a market was the first ever official grant of a weekly market to a burgh. Moreover, between 1189 and 1195, King William granted the burgh an annual fair, a fair still in existence today, increasing Glasgow's status as an important settlement. As well as new revenues for the bishop, the rights entailed by Glasgow's new burghal status and market privileges brought new people to the settlement, one of the first of whom was one Ranulf de Haddington, a former burghess of Haddington. The new settlement was laid out (probably under the influence of the <a href="Haddington%2C%20East%20Lothian">burgh of Haddington</a>) around <a href="Glasgow%20Cross">Glasgow Cross</a>, down the hill from the cathedral and old fort of Glasgow, but above the flood level of the <a href="River%20Clyde">River Clyde</a>.

When Jocelin died, he was back at Melrose Abbey, where his career had begun. He may have retired to Melrose knowing his death was near. Jocelin certainly did die at Melrose, passing away on <a href="Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Day">St Patrick's Day</a> (17 March) 1199. He was buried in the monks' <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> of Melrose Abbey Church. <a href="Hugh%20de%20Roxburgh">Hugh de Roxburgh</a>, <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20Scotland">Chancellor of Scotland</a>, was elected as Jocelin's replacement. The "Chronicle of Melrose" has only a short obituary.

Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley "Jerry" Pentland, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (5 August 1894 – 3 November 1983) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> in World War I. Born in <a href="Maitland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Maitland</a>, New South Wales, he commenced service as a <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Lighthorseman</a> with the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in 1915, and saw action at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>. He transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> the following year, rising to <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a>. Credited with twenty-three aerial victories, Pentland became the fifth highest-scoring Australian ace of the war, after <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert Little</a>, <a href="Roderic%20Dallas">Stan Dallas</a>, <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a> and <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> in January 1918 for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty" on a mission attacking an aerodrome behind enemy lines, and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> that August for engaging four hostile aircraft single-handedly.

Pentland served in the fledgling <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), and later the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, before going into business in 1927. His ventures included commercial flying around the goldfields of <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, aircraft design and manufacture, flight instruction, and charter work. In the early 1930s, he was employed as a pilot with <a href="Australian%20National%20Airways">Australian National Airways</a>, and also spent time as a dairy farmer. Soon after the outbreak of World War II, he re-enlisted in the RAAF, attaining the rank of <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and commanding rescue and communications units in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. Perhaps the oldest operational pilot in the wartime RAAF, Pentland was responsible for rescuing airmen, soldiers and civilians, and earned the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his "outstanding courage, initiative and skill". He became a trader in New Guinea when the war ended in 1945, and later a coffee planter. Retiring in 1959, he died in 1983 at the age of eighty-nine.

Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley Pentland was born in <a href="Maitland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Maitland</a>, New South Wales, on 5 August 1894. His father Alexander was Irish, and his mother Annie Norma (née Farquhar) was Scottish. Educated at <a href="The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Parramatta">The King's School</a>, Sydney, and <a href="Brighton%20Grammar%20School">Brighton Grammar</a>, Melbourne, Pentland went on to study dairy farming at <a href="Hawkesbury%20Agricultural%20College">Hawkesbury Agricultural College</a>, and later worked as a <a href="Jackaroo%20%28trainee%29">jackaroo</a>. His father was a physician who joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) during World War I and served as a <a href="major">major</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a>.

Pentland enlisted as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the AIF on 5 March 1915, sailing for Egypt with the <a href="12th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">12th Light Horse Regiment</a> aboard HMAT A29 "Suevic" on 13 June. In August, his unit deployed to <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>, where he fought as a machine gunner before being hospitalised the following month, suffering from <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>; he was evacuated to England in December. Determined to leave the trenches behind after recovering, he volunteered for the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) and was discharged from the AIF on 21 February 1916 to take up his commission as a temporary <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the RFC. His first solo flight in a <a href="Maurice%20Farman%20Longhorn">Maurice Farman Longhorn</a> at <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a>, after two hours of dual instruction, ended with him overshooting the runway and crashing in a sewage farm, but he was unhurt and immediately undertook a second solo attempt, landing successfully. It was at Brooklands that he was first nicknamed "Jerry". After completing pilot training, he was posted to France in June, flying <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">B.E.2s</a> with <a href="No.%2016%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 16 Squadron</a>. Though the slow and vulnerable B.E.2 was considered "<a href="Fokker%20Scourge">Fokker fodder</a>" by its crews, Pentland and his observer quickly managed to score the former's first aerial victory, bringing down a German <a href="Fokker%20Eindecker%20fighters">"Eindecker"</a> over <a href="Haubourdin">Habourdin</a> on 9 June. He was then posted to <a href="No.%2029%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 29 Squadron</a> and was converting to <a href="Airco%20DH.2">DH.2</a> <a href="Pusher%20configuration">"pusher"</a> fighters when he broke his leg playing rugby. After recovering, he <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructed</a> at <a href="London%20Colney">London Colney</a> until June 1917, when he joined <a href="No.%2019%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 19 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="SPAD%20S.VII">SPAD S.VII</a>s. This would become Pentland's favourite type due to its strength and manoeuvrability, even though it had to be 'flown' constantly and was unforgiving at low speed.
On 20 July 1917, soon after arriving at his new unit in France, Pentland achieved his first victory in the SPAD when he shared in the destruction of an <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a> two-seater. He followed this up with a solo "kill" on 12 August. Four days later, after stopping an enemy truck convoy in its tracks by crippling its lead vehicle with machine-gun fire, he reportedly engaged ten Albatros fighters single-handedly; by the time he had driven them off, four bullets had penetrated his leather flying suit without injuring him, while his plane had absorbed so much punishment that it had to be scrapped when he got back to base. After sharing another Albatros two-seater on 20 August, Pentland led a raid on Marcke aerodrome, home of <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Baron von Richthofen</a>'s <a href="Jasta%2011">"Jasta" 11</a>, on 26 August. On the way, he helped bring down a <a href="DFW%20C.V">DFW C.V</a>, then achieved complete surprise at the airfield, which he and his <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> proceeded to shoot up. On the return journey, he strafed an enemy train until his guns jammed and then, having managed to clear them, engaged two more German scouts. His part in the raid earned him the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 9 January 1918:

Credited with one more victory during August 1917, and another four the following month, Pentland's score stood at ten when he was injured on 26 September after an artillery shell struck his SPAD and forced him to crash land. Following his recovery, he again spent time instructing before being posted back to a front-line unit, this time <a href="No.%2087%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 87 Squadron</a>, operating <a href="Sopwith%20Dolphin">Sopwith Dolphin</a>s. Promoted <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a>, he returned to France in April 1918, having transferred the same month with the rest of the RFC to the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF). Pentland went on to achieve thirteen victories with No. 87 Squadron, where his aggressive tactics saw him dubbed the "Wild Australian" by colleagues. Appointed commander of 'B' Flight, he also frequently acted as a "lone wolf", actively seeking dogfights with enemy aircraft on his own. On 18 June, he was alone on patrol when he engaged a flight of four <a href="Rumpler">Rumpler</a> high-altitude <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> aircraft, forcing down three of them. This action earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, gazetted on 3 August:

On 25 August, Pentland attacked and destroyed two German planes, a DFW two-seater and <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a>, before himself being shot down and wounded in the foot. These would be his last victories; his grand total of twenty-three included eleven destroyed, one of which was shared, and twelve out of control, three of them shared. This score ranked him fifth among the Australian aces of the war after <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert Little</a>, <a href="Roderic%20Dallas">Stan Dallas</a>, <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a> and <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a>.

Pentland relinquished his RAF commission and returned to Australia at the end of the war, earning money by giving joyrides in an <a href="Avro%20504K">Avro 504K</a>. Looking for a more secure future, he joined the newly established <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in August 1921, following an interview with Wing Commander <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>, a wartime acquaintance through the RAF. Ranked <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, Pentland was put in charge of the RAAF's complement of <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">S.E.5</a> fighters at <a href="Point%20Cook%2C%20Victoria">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, part of the <a href="Imperial%20Gift">Imperial Gift</a> recently donated by Great Britain. The young Air Force had the atmosphere of a flying club, where everyone knew everyone else. Tensions sometimes arose between those who had served with British forces during the war, and those who had belonged to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC); the former considered that they were discriminated against when it came to filling senior positions, and came the day Pentland and fellow ex-RAF member <a href="Hippolyte%20De%20La%20Rue">Hippolyte De La Rue</a> threw an "uppity" AFC man into a <a href="mess">mess</a> fireplace. Deciding that his RAAF career was not progressing, Pentland applied for a short-service commission as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> with the RAF in 1923, which was granted as of 23 April. He journeyed to Britain with new wife Madge (née Moffat), whom he married on 5 March, just before departing Australia; they had one daughter, Carleen, the following year. Pentland completed the course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School">Central Flying School</a>, Uphavon, and became an instructor there, gaining promotion to flight lieutenant before leaving the RAF on 20 July 1926 and returning to Australia.
In 1927, Pentland formed Mandated Territory Airways with entrepreneur Albert Royal to fly freight to and from the goldfields of New Guinea. The pair bought a <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">DH.60 Moth</a> biplane, which Pentland ferried to the firm's base at <a href="Lae">Lae</a> in February 1928. The business prospered in the short term, to the extent that the partners took on another Moth and more pilots. By the end of the year, however, Pentland was suffering from <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and had to abandon the venture, selling one of the planes to Guinea Airways and returning to Australia with the other. After recovering in the new year, he embarked on a series of new enterprises, including aircraft manufacture, a flying school, and charter work. In February 1929, he formed the General Aircraft Company with Royal and another partner to produce an Australian-designed aeroplane, the Genairco, of which eight were eventually sold. With the Moth from Mandated Territory Airways, he established Pentland's Flying School at <a href="Sydney%20Airport">Mascot</a>, New South Wales. He also flew charters with a Moth owned by "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28Sydney%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper, using the same aircraft that September to compete in the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Centenary%20Air%20Race">East-West Air Race</a> from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the <a href="Centenary%20of%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia Centenary</a>. The event attracted several veteran aviators of World War I, including <a href="Horrie%20Miller%20%28aviator%29">Horrie Miller</a>—the eventual winner on handicap—and <a href="Charles%20Eaton%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles "Moth" Eaton</a>, whom Pentland beat into fifth place across the line.

Lack of patronage led to Pentland folding his businesses and taking a job in 1930 as a pilot with <a href="Australian%20National%20Airways">Australian National Airways</a> (ANA), a new airline founded by <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a>. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at <a href="Singleton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Singleton</a>. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where he was known as a practical joker who liked to hold a map in front of his face in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">war was declared</a> in September 1939.

Having offered his services to the Australian government on his return from New Guinea, Pentland rejoined the RAAF on 17 June 1940. He undertook the course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> in <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden</a>, New South Wales, and was posted as an instructor to elementary flying training schools in eastern Australia, including <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Tamworth%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tamworth</a>, <a href="Temora%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Temora</a>, <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a>, and <a href="Lowood%2C%20Queensland">Lowood</a>. Addressed by a young pilot at one school as "Pop", Pentland responded in front of the large audience, "I'm sorry son, but I don't remember sleeping with your mother". He was promoted to flight lieutenant in October 1941, and joined No. 1 Communication Flight in June 1942. Based in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Laverton</a> and, later, <a href="Essendon%20Airport">Essendon</a>, it was primarily engaged in army and naval cooperation, and operated as far afield as the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and New Guinea.

Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, in November 1942 Pentland was posted to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea, as commanding officer (CO) of <a href="Rescue%20and%20Communication%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Rescue and Communication Squadron</a>, better known as "Pentland's Flying Circus". The <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of Australia in the war</a> described this as the RAAF's "most unusual operational unit", asserting that its "strange assortment of light aircraft was as varied and as appropriate to its task as was the flying record of its commander ...". Its inventory included such types as the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a>, <a href="De%20Havilland%20Dragon">DH.84 Dragon</a>, <a href="De%20Havilland%20Fox%20Moth">Fox Moth</a>, <a href="De%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">Dragon Rapide</a>, and <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>. Perhaps the RAAF's oldest pilot in any theatre of operations, Pentland was responsible for the rescue of downed US airmen, as well as the evacuation of civilians and soldiers. He also organised aerial surveys around <a href="Daru">Daru</a> and <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, developing new bases and emergency airfields at locales such as <a href="Benabena%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Bena Bena</a>, <a href="Abau">Abau</a>, <a href="Kulpi">Kulpi</a>, and Port Moresby.

Posted back to Australia after relinquishing command of No. 1 Rescue and Communication Squadron in June 1943, Pentland received radar training and helped to set up the RAAF's early warning grid in northern Australia. He returned to New Guinea in March 1944 as CO of No. 8 Communication Unit, <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>, which had been formed in November 1943 from Pentland's old Rescue and Communications Squadron. Operating Tiger Moth, <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a>, <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a>, <a href="Dornier%20Do%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B24">Dornier Do 24</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>, <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a>, and <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a> aircraft, the unit performed reconnaissance and bombing sorties over New Britain and north-eastern New Guinea, as well as rescue and survey missions. In July 1945, Pentland was posted to Mascot as CO of No. 3 Communication Unit, serving until September. His achievements in New Guinea earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>, the citation being promulgated on 22 February 1946 and concluding:

With the end of hostilities in the Pacific, Pentland was discharged from the RAAF on 2 November 1945. He took the opportunity to purchase surplus military equipment in New Guinea and established himself as a trader in <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>, later expanding to Lae and <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a>. In 1948, he went into business as a coffee planter in <a href="Goroka">Goroka</a>, and also recruited labour from the highlands for industries on the coast. Prospering as a planter, he contributed to development of the region by building Goroka's original constant-flowing water supply and encouraging other businesses to set up there. His ongoing commitments in New Guinea meant that he was not <a href="Investiture">invested</a> with his Air Force Cross until 1950. In 1959, he sold his interests in Goroka and retired with Madge to their seaside home in <a href="Bayview%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bayview</a>, New South Wales. Madge Pentland died in 1982, and Jerry eighteen months later, on 3 November 1983, at the War Veterans Home in <a href="Collaroy%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Collaroy</a>. He was survived by daughter Carleen, and cremated on 7 November.

Winter service vehicle

A winter service vehicle (WSV), or snow removal vehicle, is a vehicle specially designed or adapted to <a href="Snow%20removal">clear thoroughfares of ice and snow</a>. Winter service vehicles are usually based on a <a href="dump%20truck">dump truck</a> <a href="chassis">chassis</a>, with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed <a href="snow%20removal">snow removal</a> equipment. Many authorities also use smaller vehicles on <a href="sidewalk">sidewalk</a>s, <a href="Trail">footpaths</a>, and <a href="cycleway">cycleway</a>s. Road maintenance agencies and contractors in <a href="temperate">temperate</a> or <a href="polar%20climate">polar</a> areas often own several winter service vehicles, using them to keep the roads clear of <a href="road%20debris">snow and ice</a> and safe for driving during winter. Airports use winter service vehicles to keep both aircraft surfaces, and <a href="runway">runway</a>s and <a href="taxiway">taxiway</a>s free of snow and ice, which, besides endangering aircraft <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a> and <a href="landing">landing</a>, can interfere with the <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a> of the craft.

The earliest winter service vehicles were snow rollers, designed to maintain a smooth, even road surface for <a href="sled">sled</a>s, although <a href="Horse-drawn%20vehicle">horse-drawn</a> <a href="snowplow">snowplow</a>s and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in motor car traffic and aviation in the early 20th century led to the development and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.

Although snow removal dates back to at least the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, early attempts merely involved using a <a href="shovel">shovel</a> or broom to remove snow from walkways and roads. Before motorised transport, snow removal was seen as less of a concern; unpaved roads in rural areas were dangerous and bumpy, and snow and ice made the surface far smoother. Most farmers could simply replace their wagons with <a href="sled">sled</a>s, allowing the transport of heavy materials such as timber with relative ease. Early communities in the northern regions of the United States and Canada even used <a href="Animal-powered%20transport">animal-drawn</a> snow rollers, the earliest winter service vehicles, to compress the snow covering roads. The compression increased the life of the snow and eased passage for sleds. Some communities even employed snow wardens to spread or "pave" snow onto exposed areas such as bridges, to allow sleds to use these routes.

However, with the increase in <a href="Pavement%20%28material%29">paved roads</a> and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with <a href="snowplow">snowplow</a>s. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.
The first motorised snowplows were developed in 1913, based on truck and <a href="tractor">tractor</a> bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted as a catalyst for the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected <a href="snow%20fence">snow fence</a>s around airfields to prevent <a href="snowdrift">snowdrift</a>s, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.

With the popularisation of the <a href="motor%20car">motor car</a>, it was found that plowing alone was insufficient for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of <a href="Gritter">gritting vehicles</a>, which used <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of <a href="car%20crash">motoring accidents</a> increased, the protests subsided and by the end of the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. As <a href="environmentalism">environmental awareness</a> increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.

Winter service vehicles are usually based on a dump truck <a href="chassis">chassis</a>, which are then converted into winter service vehicles either by the manufacturer or an <a href="Aftermarket%20%28automotive%29">aftermarket</a> third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or <a href="fibreglass">fibreglass</a>, waterproofing any exposed <a href="Electronics">electronic</a> components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, the addition of a plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, <a href="Bumper%20%28automobile%29">bumpers</a> to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra <a href="headlamp">headlamp</a>s, a <a href="light%20bar">light bar</a>, and <a href="retroreflector">retroreflector</a>s for visibility.

Other common changes include the replacement of the factory stock tires with <a href="rain%20tire">rain tire</a>s or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's <a href="wheelbase">wheelbase</a> to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada, pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.

In most countries, winter service vehicles usually have amber light bars, which are activated to indicate that the vehicle is operating below the local <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a> or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, winter service vehicles use the blue flashing lights associated with <a href="emergency%20service%20vehicle">emergency service vehicle</a>s, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. In <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, green flashing lights are used. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in <a href="whiteout%20%28weather%29">whiteout</a> conditions.

Some winter service vehicles, especially those designed for use on footpaths or <a href="pedestrian%20zone">pedestrian zone</a>s, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing the size of the fleet required by the agency or contractor.

Modern winter service vehicles will usually also have a <a href="satellite%20navigation">satellite navigation</a> system connected to a <a href="Weather%20forecasting">weather forecast</a> feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with <a href="snow%20chain">snow chain</a>s or studded tires, but some are mounted on <a href="caterpillar%20track">caterpillar track</a>s, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards the side of the road. <a href="Off-road">Off-road</a> winter service vehicles mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as <a href="snowcat">snowcat</a>s. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or <a href="Snow%20grooming">snow groomers</a>, and are used by <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a>s to smooth and maintain <a href="piste">piste</a>s and <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for <a href="chairlift">chairlift</a>s.

Military winter service vehicles are heavily armoured to allow for their use in combat zones, especially in <a href="Arctic%20warfare">Arctic</a> and <a href="mountain%20warfare">mountain warfare</a>, and often based on <a href="combat%20bulldozer">combat bulldozer</a>s or <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a>s. Military winter service vehicles have been used by the United Nations, <a href="Kosovo%20Force">Kosovo Force</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> in Central Europe during the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>, while during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a> deployed a number of tracked vehicles in <a href="Norway">Norway</a> to patrol the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> border with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Winter service vehicles are operated by both government agencies and by private <a href="subcontractor">subcontractor</a>s. <a href="Public%20works">Public works</a> in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay <a href="retainer%20agreement">retainers</a> to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter service vehicles in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use <a href="red%20diesel">red diesel</a>. Though the vehicles still use public highways, they are used to keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a <a href="Class%20A%20truck">Class A</a> or <a href="Class%20B%20truck">Class B</a> <a href="commercial%20driver%27s%20license">commercial driver's license</a>. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed <a href="driving%20simulator">driving simulator</a>s, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a <a href="City%20%26amp%3B%20Guilds">City & Guilds</a> qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.
Winter service vehicle drivers usually work <a href="part%20time">part time</a>, before and during inclement weather only, with drivers working a 12- to 16-hour shift. Main roads are typically gritted in advance, to reduce the disruption to the network. Salt barns are provided at regular intervals for drivers to collect more grit, and bedding is provided at <a href="road%20maintenance%20depot">road maintenance depot</a>s for drivers to use between shifts in heavy or prolonged storms.

Weather conditions typically vary greatly depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive very little in low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid <a href="frost">frost</a> formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start and end of the snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmission</a> systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight <a href="hairpin%20turn">hairpin turn</a>s found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.

De-icers spray heated <a href="de-icing%20fluid">de-icing fluid</a>, often <a href="propylene%20glycol">propylene glycol</a> or <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a>, onto icy surfaces such as the bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming on the body of the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> they provide while increasing <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.
Aircraft de-icing vehicles usually consist of a large <a href="tanker%20truck">tanker truck</a>, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a <a href="cherry%20picker">cherry picker</a> crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.

In road snow and ice control, <a href="brine">brine</a> is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or at the onset of the storm. This keeps snow and ice from adhering to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.

Airport runways are also de-iced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.

<a href="Loader%20%28equipment%29">Front-end loaders</a> are commonly used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which can also be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.

A gritter, also known as a sander, salt spreader or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit <a href="halite">(rock salt)</a>, onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an <a href="impeller">impeller</a>, attached by a <a href="hydraulic%20drive%20system">hydraulic drive system</a> to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding on the back of the truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.

Salt reduces the melting point of ice by <a href="freezing-point%20depression">freezing-point depression</a>, causing it to melt at lower temperatures and run off to the edge of the road, while sand increases traction by increasing <a href="friction">friction</a> between car <a href="tire">tire</a>s and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with the condition of the road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately is dropped, while thick snow can require up to of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped. The grit is sometimes mixed with <a href="molasses">molasses</a> to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road.

Gritters are among the winter service vehicles also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the <a href="airframe">airframe</a> of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous <a href="potassium%20acetate">potassium acetate</a> or <a href="urea">urea</a> onto the runways instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.

Gritters can also be used in hot weather, when temperatures are high enough to melt the <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a> used in <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>. The grit is dropped to provide a protective layer between the road surface and the tires of passing vehicles, which would otherwise damage the road surface by "plucking out" the bitumen-coated <a href="Aggregate%20%28composite%29">aggregate</a> from the road surface.

Snow blowers, also known as rotating snowplows or snow cutters, can be used in place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached to the top of the blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the <a href="windrow">windrow</a> from blocking driveways.

Some railroads occasionally use air-blowing machines, each powered by a <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>, to clear snow from tracks and switches. In addition to physically blowing snow with the force of the air, they melt recalictrant precipitation with exhaust temperatures over . Approximately 100 are believed to have been manufactured in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s; they are used so rarely that they are generally maintained indefinitely rather than being replaced. For example, in the Boston area the MBTA uses two model RP-3 Portec RMC Hurricane Jet Snow Blowers, nicknamed "Snowzilla", to clear heavy snows from the <a href="Ashmont%E2%80%93Mattapan%20High%20Speed%20Line">Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line</a> and <a href="Wellington%20%28MBTA%20station%29">Wellington Yard</a>. The jet snow blowers can be faster and gentler than conventional removal methods, but consume a large amount of fuel.

A snow groomer is a machine designed to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers were used by residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy <a href="Roller%20%28agricultural%20tool%29">roller</a> hauled by <a href="ox">ox</a>en which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With the invention of the motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a>s, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including <a href="skiing">skiing</a>, <a href="snowboarding">snowboarding</a> and <a href="snowmobiling">snowmobiling</a>. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or <a href="snowcat">snowcat</a> and then hauled across the area to be groomed.

The development of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce <a href="half-pipe">half-pipe</a>s and <a href="Mini%20ramp">ramps</a> for snowboarding. Snow groomers are also used in conjunction with <a href="snow%20cannon">snow cannon</a>s, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the <a href="infiltration%20%28hydrology%29">infiltration</a> rate of the soil while decreasing the <a href="field%20capacity">field capacity</a>. This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to <a href="erosion">erosion</a>.

A snow melting vehicle works by scooping snow into a melting pit located in a large tank at the rear of the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the <a href="storm%20drain">storm drain</a>s.

Because they have to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting machines tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by <a href="semi-trailer%20truck">semi-trailer</a> <a href="tractor%20unit">tractor unit</a>s. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.

Snow melters are in some ways more environmentally friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can be separated from the meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, because the snow is melted on board, the costs of transporting snow from the site are eliminated. On the other hand, snow melting can require large amounts of energy, which has its own costs and environmental impact.

Many winter service vehicles can be fitted with snowplows, to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. In most cases, the plows are mounted on <a href="hydraulics">hydraulically</a>-actuated arms, allowing them to be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. Most winter service vehicles include either permanently fixed plows or plow frames: 75% of the UK's <a href="Highways%20Agency">Highways Agency</a> vehicles include a plow frame to which a blade can be attached. Winter service vehicles with both a plow frame and a gritting body are known as "all purpose vehicles", and while these are more efficient than using dedicated vehicles, the weight of the hopper often decreases the range of the vehicle. Therefore, most operators will keep at least a few dedicated plowing vehicles in store for heavy storms.

In the event that specially designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or <a href="construction%20vehicle">construction vehicle</a>s can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are <a href="grader">grader</a>s, <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a>s, <a href="skid%20loader">skid loader</a>s, <a href="pickup%20trucks">pickup trucks</a> and <a href="rubbish%20truck">rubbish truck</a>s. <a href="Front-end%20loader">Front-end loader</a>s can also be used to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to <a href="overtaking">overtake</a>; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.

A snow sweeper uses brushes to remove thin layers of snow from the pavement surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing to remove any remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and <a href="racing%20track">racing track</a>s, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a>s and <a href="tram%20stop">tram stop</a>s, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below . Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than . A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.

The surface friction tester is a small fifth wheel attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure <a href="road%20slipperiness">road slipperiness</a>. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly <a href="Yaw%20angle">turned</a> relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the <a href="torque">torque</a> produced by the rotation of the wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small <a href="Compact%20car">compact</a> or <a href="estate%20car">estate car</a>s or to a small <a href="Trailer%20%28vehicle%29">trailer</a>, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.

To improve traction and melt ice or snow, winter service vehicles spread granular or liquid ice melting chemicals and grit, such as sand or gravel.

The most common chemical is <a href="rock%20salt">rock salt</a>, which can melt snow at low temperatures, but has some unwanted side effects. If the salt concentration becomes high enough, it can be toxic to plant and animal life and greatly accelerate <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> of metals, so operators should limit gritting to an absolute minimum. The dropped salt is eventually washed away and lost, so it may not be reused or collected after gritting runs. By contrast, the insoluble sand can be collected and recycled by <a href="Street%20sweeper">street sweeping vehicles</a> and mixed with new salt crystals to be reused in later batches of grit.

<a href="Sea%20salt">Sea salt</a> may not be used, as it is too fine and dissolves too quickly, so all salt used in gritting comes from salt mines, a <a href="renewable">non-renewable</a> source. As a result, some road maintenance agencies have networks of ice prediction stations, to prevent unnecessary gritting which not only wastes salt, but can damage the environment and disrupt traffic.

The U.S. state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> uses <a href="magnesium%20chloride">magnesium chloride</a>, a relatively cheap chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, but less reactive, while New Zealand uses <a href="calcium%20magnesium%20acetate">calcium magnesium acetate</a>, which avoids the environmentally harmful <a href="chloride">chloride</a> <a href="ion">ion</a> altogether. <a href="Urea">Urea</a> is sometimes used to grit <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a>s, as it does not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.
In some areas of the world, including <a href="Berlin%2C%20Germany">Berlin, Germany</a>, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for <a href="bus">bus</a>es to pull in at bus stops.

Grit is often mixed with <a href="hydrate">hydrous</a> <a href="sodium%20ferrocyanide">sodium ferrocyanide</a> as an <a href="anticaking%20agent">anticaking agent</a> which, while harmless in its natural form, can undergo <a href="photodissociation">photodissociation</a> in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept as far as possible from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff water</a> entering <a href="fishery">fisheries</a> or farms.

Gritting vehicles are also dangerous to <a href="overtaking">overtake</a>; as grit is scattered across the entire roadway, loose pieces can damage the paintwork and windows of passing cars. Loose salt does not provide sufficient traction for motorcycles, which can lead to skidding, especially around corners.

Ann Bannon

Ann Weldy (born September 15, 1932), better known by her pen name Ann Bannon, is an American author who, from 1957 to 1962, wrote six <a href="lesbian%20pulp%20fiction">lesbian pulp fiction</a> novels known as "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles". The books' enduring popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title "Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction". Bannon was a young housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the <a href="archetype">archetype</a> of a <a href="Butch%20and%20femme">butch</a> lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not feel she was able to live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships.

Her books shaped lesbian identity for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, she earned a doctorate in <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27 years and, as she separated from her husband in the 1980s, her books were republished; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> production. They are taught in <a href="Women%27s%20studies">Women's</a> and <a href="LGBT%20studies">LGBT studies</a> courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as "the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties", and it has been said that her books "rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian".

Ann Bannon was born Ann Weldy in <a href="Joliet%2C%20Illinois">Joliet, Illinois</a>, in 1932. She grew up in nearby <a href="Hinsdale%2C%20Illinois">Hinsdale</a> with her mother and stepfather, and had the responsibility of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign</a> she belonged to <a href="Kappa%20Kappa%20Gamma">Kappa Kappa Gamma</a> <a href="sorority">sorority</a> where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular with men and with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was "unfailingly gracious" to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, "I saw a lot of it happening and I didn't know what to make of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of <a href="Johnny%20Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a> and <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.

Bannon was 22 years old when she began writing her first pulp novel. She was influenced by the only lesbian novels she had read, "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>" by <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a> from 1928 and <a href="Vin%20Packer">Vin Packer</a>'s "<a href="Spring%20Fire">Spring Fire</a>" from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel, but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of "Spring Fire". Bannon said, "Both books completely obsessed me for the better part of two years." Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them. In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said, "I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming me for a long time down on paper."

Paperback books in the United States expanded prominently after World War II through the marketing strategies of <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a>, who began to distribute publications through newspapers, newsstands, grocery stores, and bus and train stations. The retail opportunities of paperback books grew about tenfold with this method. In 1950, rival company <a href="Gold%20Medal%20Books">Gold Medal Books</a> published "<a href="Women%27s%20Barracks">Women's Barracks</a>", a fictionalized account of author <a href="Tereska%20Torres">Tereska Torres</a>' experience serving in the <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French Forces</a>. The book depicts a lesbian relationship the author witnessed, ending with one of the women committing suicide. It sold 4.5 million copies, and Gold Medal Books' editors were "thrilled". Its success earned it a mention in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Gold Medal Books was a branch of <a href="Fawcett%20Publications">Fawcett Publications</a> that focused on paperback books which at the time were printed on very cheap paper, not designed to last for more than a year, sold for 25 cents in drug stores and other venues all over the United States and Canada. The books made for cheap, easy reading that could be discarded at the end of a trip at very little cost to the customer. Because of the low quality of production, they earned the name <a href="pulp%20fiction%20%28genre%29">pulp fiction</a>.

Gold Medal Books quickly followed "Women's Barracks" with "Spring Fire", eager to cash in on the unprecedented sales, and it sold almost copies in 1952. Vin Packer, whose real name is <a href="Marijane%20Meaker">Marijane Meaker</a>, and Gold Medal Books were overwhelmed with mail from women who identified with the lesbian characters.

One of the letters was from Bannon, asking for professional assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, "To this day I have no idea why she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it "<a href="Emerald%20City">Emerald City</a>, <a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Wonderland</a>, and <a href="Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a> combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a <a href="subplot">subplot</a> consisting of two sorority sisters who had fallen in love with each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became "Odd Girl Out"."

"The Beebo Brinker Chronicle"s are six books in all, first published between 1957 and 1962. They featured four characters who appeared in at least three of the books in a chronological saga of coming to terms with their homosexuality and navigating their ways through gay and lesbian relationships. The first in the series, "<a href="Odd%20Girl%20Out%20%28novel%29">Odd Girl Out</a>", was published in 1957, and became Gold Medal Books' second best-selling title of the year. Based on Bannon's own experiences, the plot involved a lesbian relationship between two sorority sisters in a fictional sorority at a fictional midwestern university. As was custom with pulp fiction novels, neither the cover art nor the title were under the control of the author. Both were approved by the publisher in order to be as suggestive and lurid as possible. The main character is Laura Landon, who realizes that she's in love with Beth, her older, more experienced roommate, a leader in the sorority.

Lesbians depicted in literature were relatively rare in the 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of "Spring Fire": she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Inspection%20Service">postal inspectors</a> would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their <a href="censorship">censorship</a> after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including <a href="Roth%20v.%20United%20States">Roth v. United States</a> and another regarding <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>'s "<a href="Howl">Howl</a>" in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to "Odd Girl Out" did not veer too far from the unsatisfactory resolution formula of "Spring Fire", "Women's Barracks", and <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a>'s "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>", it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.

The characters and their stories served as an extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her "fantasy friends" whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing "Odd Girl Out", she set out to gain what she termed "fieldwork experience" in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern <a href="California">California</a>. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the <a href="jail">slam</a> with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian</a> wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go <a href="suicide">jump off the Brooklyn Bridge</a>.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.

Bannon followed "Odd Girl Out" with "<a href="I%20Am%20a%20Woman">I Am a Woman</a> (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?)" in 1959. "I Am a Woman" (the working and common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as she finds herself in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character that proved to be her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly <a href="Butch%20and%20femme">butch</a> lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind ... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." The resolution to "I Am a Woman" completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.

Letters began to pour in for her from all over the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for reassurance that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2) ... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards."

Although her husband was aware of the books she was writing, he showed no interest in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name "Bannon" from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. "I couldn't stand some of what was happening to me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my <a href="nervous%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> for me ... I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," she recalled later. "<a href="Women%20in%20the%20Shadows">Women in the Shadows</a>" was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined <a href="interracial%20relationships">interracial relationships</a>, <a href="self-loathing">self-loathing</a> in matters of sexuality and race, <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details of what it was like to <a href="Passing%20%28sexual%20orientation%29">pass</a> as <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.

Her fourth book in the series, "<a href="Journey%20to%20a%20Woman">Journey to a Woman</a>," published in 1960, again shows parallels between Bannon's own life and her plots. Beth, of Laura's affair in "Odd Girl Out", is living with her husband and children in Southern California. She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but "very bewildered and unstable person." Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, "The Marriage", also published in 1960, again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality. In it, Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister, and must decide whether they will stay together or conform to societal standards.

Returning to the character she fantasized about the most, the last book in the series, "<a href="Beebo%20Brinker%20%28novel%29">Beebo Brinker</a>", published in 1962, was Bannon's <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to "Odd Girl Out". It follows Beebo around <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> ten years before she meets Laura in "I Am a Woman." Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown into New York City to find a waiting friend in Jack, and to discover herself. She begins an affair with a famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life.

In 1961 and 1962 Bannon also contributed several articles to "<a href="ONE%2C%20Inc.">ONE, Inc.</a>", the magazine of a <a href="homophile">homophile</a> activist organization in Southern California. One of them was a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of "Women in the Shadows". She was invited to speak to the <a href="Mattachine%20Society">Mattachine Society</a> in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll. She stated later, "It began to be very painful. So every time I would start to reach out (to the lesbian/gay community), I would get struck down ... In my own life, I couldn't operationalize (my feeling that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives). I couldn't find a way."

After "Beebo Brinker", Bannon said the energy to write about the characters left her, but she got so good at her "obsessive fantasies" that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at <a href="Sacramento%20State%20University">Sacramento State University</a> and her doctorate in <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>. She was an English <a href="professor">professor</a> at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.

Ann Bannon's books began to fade away from publishing memory after initial publication, especially after Gold Medal Books went out of business. In 1975, however, Bannon was asked to include four of her books in Arno Press's library edition of "Homosexuality: Lesbians and Gay Men in Society, History and Literature". Then, in 1983, <a href="Barbara%20Grier">Barbara Grier</a> of the lesbian publishing company <a href="Naiad%20Press">Naiad Press</a> actively tracked Bannon down and reissued the books in new covers. Grier discussed the novels, answering the question of who among lesbian paperback authors should be highlighted: "Ann Bannon. Without even a discussion ... In terms of actual influence, sales, everything, Bannon."

Bannon did not outwardly advertise the fact that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the <a href="Physical%20education">PE</a> majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file was the only one that was any fun." She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of <a href="chronic%20fatigue%20syndrome">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know."

In 1984, Bannon's books were featured in the documentary "<a href="Before%20Stonewall">Before Stonewall</a>" about how gay men and lesbians lived prior to the 1969 <a href="Stonewall%20riots">Stonewall riots</a>, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: "I picked up this paperback and I opened it up ... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before." She was featured in the Canadian documentary "" in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the <a href="Quality%20Paperback%20Book%20Club">Quality Paperback Book Club</a> in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for "Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969" in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles" were reissued by <a href="Cleis%20Press">Cleis Press</a> again between 2001 and 2003—excluding "The Marriage"—with <a href="autobiography">autobiographical</a> forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.

Reacting to the renewed interest in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to "Odd Girl Out" that she was shocked to find out that her characters were not only remembered but that they were <a href="archetypes">archetypes</a> among the lesbian community. The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and <a href="LGBT%20studies">LGBT studies</a> college courses. Bannon often admits to being surprised by this, explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing "Odd Girl Out": "If I "had" known, it might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that would have been so cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now."

Since so little information was available about lesbians and lesbianism at the time, Bannon's books, through their far-reaching distribution and popularity served to form a part of a lesbian <a href="identity%20%28social%20science%29">identity</a> not only for the heterosexual population at large, but lesbians themselves. Lesbian author and historian <a href="Joan%20Nestle">Joan Nestle</a> called the books "survival literature", explaining: "In whatever towns or cities these books were read, they were spreading the information that meant a new hope for trapped and isolated women". One retrospective writer noted, "[U]ntil the late 1960s, when the sexual revolution was emerging, the pulps provided a cultural space that helped to forge a queer identity".

Scholar Andrea Loewenstein published the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes that they were "exceptionally good pulp" that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 had a tendency to reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. "Since much of our past is so bitter, [we] ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in "Odd Girl Out" while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in "Women in the Shadows" by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is "surprisingly ... passionate, tender, and erotic".

Writer Diane Hamer attests that Bannon's books and characters represent a part of identity where women are unsure if they are gay or straight, man or woman, ashamed or accepting of who they are. In receiving no clear answers from Bannon herself, women were left to try to figure these questions out for themselves. Hamer writes, "What Bannon did was to provide a "range" of possible trajectories to lesbianism ... Bannon, by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters, produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity."

Bannon also addresses the issue of race in "Women in the Shadows" when Laura begins an affair with a woman representing herself as Eastern Indian, but who is actually a lighter skinned African American. The duality of their relationship is expressed not only in skin color but through their personalities. Laura, blond and passionate, contrasts with Tris, who is dark but emotionally detached. Race, in this instance, is a "metaphor for the opposition between inside and outside that govern Bannon's sense of what a lesbian is".

The concept of a lesbian identity is also explored throughout "Journey to a Woman", as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself at the end of the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent the anguish of self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in "Women in the Shadows". Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in "Odd Girl Out" and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain "a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery". Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.

In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon addressed the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted what she knew and felt at the time. Bannon has said she knows the concerns of the women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited when I was writing them."

All five books of "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles" depict characters trying to come to terms with their ostracism from heterosexual society. Christopher Nealon adds that the characters are also trying to "understand the relationship between their bodies and their desires"; the continuing appeal of the novels, Nealon states, is due to the characters being "beautifully misembodied".

In "Odd Girl Out", Laura Landon's resistance to the idea that she may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In "I Am a Woman", the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance "seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura", leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo in a moment of self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently. In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, "Women in the Shadows", Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed. Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a man, if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.

Bannon's last book, "Beebo Brinker", which takes place before the others when Beebo is eighteen years old, focuses on her realization not only that she is gay, but that she is also a masculine woman. Nealon writes that Bannon's exploration of Beebo's masculinity is not to give excuses for her desires, but "to get at the source of specialness, the sources of her claim to be treated with dignity". By connecting her characters' bodies with their desires, Bannon allows further understanding of self as normal, and that homosexuality is acceptable.

Bannon's books, like most pulp fiction novels, were not reviewed by newspapers or magazines when they were originally published between 1957 and 1962. However, since their release they have been the subject of analyses that offer differing opinions of Bannon's books as a reflection of the moral standards of the decade, a subtle defiance of those morals, or a combination of both. Andrea Loewenstein notes Bannon's use of cliché, suggesting that it reflected Bannon's own belief in the culturally repressive ideas of the 1950s. Conversely, writer Jeff Weinstein remarks that Bannon's "potboilers" are an expression of freedom because they address issues mainstream fiction did not in the 1950s. Instead of cliché, Weinstein writes that her characters become more realistic as she exploits the dramatic plots, because they "are influenced by the melodramatic conventions of the culture that excludes them".

Diane Hamer likens Bannon's work to the <a href="Mills%20and%20Boon">Mills and Boon</a> of lesbian literature, but unlike conventional romance novels, her stories never really have neat and tidy conclusions. Hamer also takes note of Bannon's use of Freudian symbolism: in "I Am a Woman", Jack frequently mentions that he is being <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalyzed</a>, and his friends react with interest. Jack labels Laura "Mother" and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series, as though Bannon—through Jack—is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s. Scholar Michele Barale remarks that Bannon's literary devices in "Beebo Brinker" defy the expectations of the audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed: heterosexual males. Bannon chooses the first character, an "everyman" named—significantly—Jack Mann, with whom the male audience identifies, only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts. His interest turns to Beebo, whom he finds "handsome" and lost, and he takes her home, gets her drunk, and becomes asexually intimate with her. Barale writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story, then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them, though eventually places them in a safe position to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view.

The erotic nature of the books has been noted as adding to their uniqueness. Loewenstein remarks on the intensity of Laura's passion: "The presentation of a woman as a joyfully aggressive person is, in itself, a rare achievement in 1957". A 2002 retrospective of Bannon's books claims "there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else". Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon's books as a form of rebellion. In the "Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review", <a href="Jenifer%20Levin">Jenifer Levin</a> writes, "Know this: "Beebo lives". From the midst of a repressive era, from the pen of a very proper, scholarly, "seemingly" conforming wife and mother, came this astonishingly open queer figment of fictional being, like molten material from some volcano of the lesbian soul."

Bannon's books have, with the benefit of time, been described in vastly different terms, from "literary works" among pulp contemporaries, to "libidinised trash". However disparately Bannon's books are described in feminist and lesbian literary retrospectives, almost every mention concedes the significance of "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles". One retrospective writer called Bannon's books "titillating trash, but indispensable reading to the nation's lesbians."

Critics have since remarked that Bannon's books are remarkable for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately. The continuity of characters in the series also gave her books a unique quality, especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one-dimensional <a href="stereotypes">stereotypes</a> who met punishment for their desires. Bannon's characters have been called "accessibly human", and still engrossing by contemporary standards compared to being "revolutionary" when first released. LGBT historian <a href="Susan%20Stryker">Susan Stryker</a> describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships, which Bannon attributed to not letting go of the hope that she could "salvage (her) own life." One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is because they were so different from anything else being published at the time: "Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, and more often than not resulted in death ... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love, while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise."

Bannon set her stories in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As described in "Beebo Brinker", one had to knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal <a href="Stonewall%20riots">Stonewall riots</a> in 1969 that started the <a href="gay%20rights%20movement">gay rights movement</a>. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time about what it was like to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material ... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market."

Author <a href="Katherine%20V.%20Forrest">Katherine V. Forrest</a> claimed Bannon and her books "are in a class by themselves" and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, "Overwhelming need led me to walk a gauntlet of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air ... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was."

In 2007, an <a href="Off-Off-Broadway">off-off-Broadway</a> company named The Hourglass Group produced an adaptation of "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles" in a production that ran for a month. The writers used material from "I Am a Woman", "Women in the Shadows" and "Journey to a Woman" to predominantly positive reviews. It was successful enough to be moved <a href="Off%20Broadway">Off Broadway</a> for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted to make it more appealing by turning to <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> for comedy. However, one of the writers said, "I just felt like, how can you turn these people into a joke? I mean, these people are real people! Why would I direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous? We are allowed to do something else besides camp." The stage adaptation of "The Beebo Brinker Chronicles" was produced by <a href="Lily%20Tomlin">Lily Tomlin</a> and <a href="Jane%20Wagner">Jane Wagner</a>, and it won the <a href="Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation">Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a> (GLAAD) Media Award for "fair, accurate, and inclusive" portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater. In April 2008, Bannon appeared with the Seattle Women's Chorus in a performance called "Vixen Fiction". Bannon read excerpts of her work and discussed the effects of her writing on her own life and the lives of her readers. U.S. cable network <a href="HBO">HBO</a> has optioned Bannon's novels for potential development as a series.

In 1997, Bannon's work was included in a collection of authors who had made the deepest impact on the lives and identities of gays and lesbians, titled "Particular Voices: Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers". In 2000, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a> awarded Bannon a Certificate of Honor "for breaking new ground with works like "Odd Girl Out" and "Women in the Shadows"" and for "voic (ing) lesbian experiences at a time when explicit lesbian subject matter was silenced by government and communities." In 2004, Bannon was elected into the <a href="Saints%20and%20Sinners%20Literary%20Festival">Saints and Sinners Literary Festival</a> Hall of Fame. She received the Sacramento State Alumni Association's Distinguished Faculty Award for 2005, and received the Trailblazer Award from the Golden Crown Literary Society the same year; the GCLS created the Ann Bannon GCLS Popular Choice Award. She was the recipient of the Alice B Award in 2008, that goes to authors whose careers have been distinguished by consistently well-written stories about lesbians. In May 2008, Bannon was given the Pioneer Award from the <a href="Lambda%20Literary%20Foundation">Lambda Literary Foundation</a>.

In 2012, she was named by <a href="Equality%20Forum">Equality Forum</a> as one of their 31 Icons of the <a href="LGBT%20History%20Month">LGBT History Month</a>.

Ann Bannon retired from teaching and college administration at California State University, Sacramento, in 1997, but tours the country visiting paperback-collecting conventions and speaking at colleges and universities about her writings and experiences. She was a guest of <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>-winning talk show "<a href="Fresh%20Air">Fresh Air</a>" with <a href="Terry%20Gross">Terry Gross</a>, and has also been featured in Gross's book, "All I Did Was Ask", a collection of transcripts from the show. Bannon also speaks at gay-themed events around the country and is working on her memoirs.

In a recent editorial written by Bannon in "<a href="Curve%20%28magazine%29">Curve</a>", she discussed how her books survived despite criticisms by censors, Victorian moralists, and purveyors of literary "snobbery" in writing, "To the persistent surprise of many of us, and of the critics who found us such an easy target years ago, the books by, of and for women found a life of their own. They—and we—may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable 'nice' literature, as it were—but I have come to value that historical judgment. We wrote the stories no one else could tell. And in so doing, we captured a slice of life in a particular time and place that still resonates for members of our community."

Deep Throat (The X-Files episode)

"Deep Throat" is the second episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", which premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on September 17, 1993. Written by series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> and directed by <a href="Daniel%20Sackheim">Daniel Sackheim</a>, the episode introduced several elements which would become staples of the <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">series' mythology</a>.

<a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) investigate cases linked to the <a href="paranormal">paranormal</a>, called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. Mulder believes in paranormal phenomena, while the skeptical Scully attempts to discredit them. In this episode, the pair investigate a possible conspiracy in the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> and Mulder meets a mysterious informant who warns him to stay away from the case. Undeterred, Mulder continues and comes closer to the truth about extraterrestrial life than ever before, only to have his progress taken away from him again.

The episode introduced the <a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Deep Throat</a> character, played by <a href="Jerry%20Hardin">Jerry Hardin</a>, who served as Mulder's informant for the first season. The character was inspired by the historical <a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28Watergate%29">Deep Throat</a>, and served to bridge the gap between the protagonists and the conspirators they would investigate. The episode itself focused on common elements of <a href="ufology">ufology</a>, with a setting reminiscent of <a href="Area%2051">Area 51</a> and <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Nellis Air Force Base</a>. It contained several special effects that Carter later described as "good, given the [series'] restrictions"; although he singled out the scenes featuring blinking lights as being poorly executed. In its initial American broadcast, "Deep Throat" was viewed by approximately 6.9 million households and 11.1 million viewers and attracted positive reviews from critics.

In southwestern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, near Ellens Air Force Base, <a href="Military%20Police%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">military police</a> raid the home of Colonel Robert Budahas, who has stolen a military vehicle and barricaded himself inside. They discover Budahas in his bathroom, trembling and covered in rashes.

Four months later, <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) meet at a <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> bar to discuss the Budahas case. Mulder explains that Budahas, a <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>, has not been seen since the raid and the military will not comment on his condition; the FBI has refused to investigate. Mulder claims that six other pilots are missing at the base, which is subject to rumors about experimental aircraft. While using the bar's restroom, Mulder is approached by a mysterious informant named "<a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Deep Throat</a>" (<a href="Jerry%20Hardin">Jerry Hardin</a>), who cautions him to avoid the case. He claims that Mulder is under surveillance, which later proves to be true.

Mulder and Scully travel to Idaho and meet with Budahas' wife, Anita, who claims her husband exhibited erratic behavior before his disappearance. She takes them to a neighbor whose husband, also a test pilot, is behaving similarly. Scully makes an appointment with the base's director, Colonel Kissell, but he refuses to talk when they visit his home. They subsequently meet local reporter Paul Mossinger, who refers them to a local <a href="UFO">UFO</a>-themed <a href="diner">diner</a>; there, they discuss UFOs with the owner, who believes she has witnessed several nearby.

Visiting the base that night, the agents witness a mysterious aircraft performing seemingly impossible maneuvers in the night sky. They flee when a <a href="black%20helicopter">black helicopter</a> approaches, seemingly in pursuit of Emil and Zoe, a trespassing teenage couple. As Mulder treats Emil and Zoe to a meal at the diner, they tell the agents about the lights and how they believe the UFOs are launched from another nearby base. Meanwhile, Budahas is returned to his home with no memory of what happened. After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs they have taken and order them to leave town.

An indignant Mulder sneaks onto the base with help from Emil and Zoe. He sees a <a href="Aurora%20%28aircraft%29">triangular craft</a> fly overhead and then is captured by soldiers who tamper with his memory. Meanwhile, Scully reencounters Mossinger, whom she discovers is actually a security operative for the base. At gunpoint, she forces him to guide her to the base and exchanges him for Mulder. Having been denied the truth about the base, Mulder and Scully return to Washington. Days later, Mulder encounters Deep Throat while jogging at a local track. Mulder asks if "they" really are present on Earth; Deep Throat responds that "they have been here for a long, long time".

This episode marked Hardin's first appearance as Deep Throat. Series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> stated that the character was inspired by the historical <a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28Watergate%29">Deep Throat</a>, an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a> to journalists <a href="Carl%20Bernstein">Carl Bernstein</a> and <a href="Bob%20Woodward">Bob Woodward</a>. This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI <a href="Deputy%20Director%20of%20the%20Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Associate Director</a> <a href="Mark%20Felt">Mark Felt</a>. Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by <a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a> in the 1991 <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> film "<a href="JFK%20%28film%29">JFK</a>". Carter created the character to bridge the gap between Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep Throat as a man "who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists". Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in "<a href="The%20Firm%20%281993%20film%29">The Firm</a>", and described the casting as an "easy choice". Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal "very, very good".

According to Carter, it was evident that "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" was a "series in making" during this episode. The episode was inspired by common <a href="ufology">ufology</a>. Believers in aliens have long thought that <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>'s <a href="Area%2051">Area 51</a> and <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Nellis Air Force Base</a> have alien technology captured during 1947's <a href="Roswell%20UFO%20incident">Roswell UFO incident</a>. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> had started a project named the <a href="Aurora%20%28aircraft%29">Aurora Project</a>. Carter said he remembered people talking about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a "nod" to it. The surname for the two <a href="Recurring%20character">guest character</a>s, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before, so they were trained on how to hold them properly.

The scenes in which Mulder infiltrates the air base were shot at a real United States airbase. With a small budget and a television schedule to think of, Carter said the effects seemed "good, given the restrictions" they faced. The <a href="UFO">UFO</a> was digitally constructed, based around what visual effects supervisor Mat Beck described as a "sort of disco light rig" that was rented from a "party supplier". Carter commented on Sackheim's direction, noting that the episode was "shot well". Towards the end of filming the night-time scenes, the sun was beginning to rise, forcing crew member John Bartley to rig the angles to keep the scenes as dark as possible. One scene, in which Mulder infiltrates the Air Force base, had already been rewritten to change its daytime setting to night; the rising sun forced the scene to be filmed as originally conceived.

The house used for the exterior shots of the Budahas family's home was reused in Carter's next series, "<a href="Millennium%20%28TV%20series%29">Millennium</a>", as the home of protagonist <a href="Frank%20Black%20%28character%29">Frank Black</a>. The house's owner was a <a href="flight%20attendant">flight attendant</a> who frequently met cast and crew members as they traveled in and out of Vancouver. The initial scene with Duchovny and Anderson in the bar was shot at a Vancouver restaurant called The Meat Market, which according to Carter was a much "divier location than the production designers would have you believe". The Meat Market was the only bar the crew could find that had not been renovated in the wake of <a href="Expo%2086">Expo 86</a> and retained a "well-travelled" feel. It later appeared in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> episode "<a href="Piper%20Maru">Piper Maru</a>". The roadside diner used for interior shots of the "Flying Saucer Diner" was remote enough from the other filming locations that a bus was made available to transport crew members, to save on travel expenses. Only <a href="key%20grip">key grip</a> Al Campbell made use of this bus service, causing producers to abandon the idea until the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> episode "<a href="Herrenvolk%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Herrenvolk</a>".

Guest star <a href="Seth%20Green">Seth Green</a> stated that despite being cast as "stoner kid" Emil, and having "cornered the market on the affable stoner in TV and film", he had never used <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> before. Green related that his first day on the set came just after Duchovny had finished filming his final scene; Green was impressed with Duchovny's demeanour and <a href="Improvisational%20theatre">improvisational</a> acting, and has added that the two "just goofed off the whole time".

Carter claimed that the scenes with the flashing lights in the sky were the "worst effects we've ever done", given limits on money and time; he also commented that <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s were still in their infancy. Beck was the special effects producer and supervisor during season one; he and Carter unsuccessfully tried to make the special effects look three dimensional and "better". According to Carter, the result looked like a "kind of hi-tech "<a href="Pong">Pong</a>" game".

This episode marks <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a>'s debut as a solo composer for the series. Carter stated he and the production crew were "fearful" of using too much music in the episode, and the first season as a whole. Anderson's voice over narration towards the end of the episode was inserted after complaints from Fox executives, who desired more closure. The executives felt that viewers were not supposed to be "confused" after watching and must have at least a slight idea of what was going on. The voiceovers became a common technique for the remainder of the series.

Mossinger's warning to Mulder that some truths should be kept hidden from the public has been cited by scholars as representing the difficulty of forcing large organizations to take responsibility for wrongdoing. The episode's final revelation, that aliens have been on Earth "for a long, long time", has been cited as following a trend of <a href="Post-Futurism">post-futurism</a> established by science fiction cinema in the 1980s. This trend has replaced traditional science fiction topics such as space exploration with themes inspired by the Watergate scandal and the spread of conspiracy theories.

"Deep Throat" premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on September 17, 1993, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on September 24, 1994. This episode's initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 6.9 million households and 11.1 million viewers. It earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 7.3, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 7.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in 1996, alongside "<a href="Pilot%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Pilot</a>"; as well being released on DVD as part of the complete first season. It was later included on "<a href="The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%201%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Abduction">The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1 – Abduction</a>", a DVD collection containing episodes centered on the series' mythology.

In a first season retrospective in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", the episode was rated a B+, with praise for Hardin's "world-weary" performance, though the review noted that the "querulous, ominous tone" of the episode was "a little awkward, but full of promise of things to come". Adrienne Martini of the "<a href="Austin%20Chronicle">Austin Chronicle</a>" called the episode "fun to watch", describing it as "great TV"; while the "<a href="San%20Jose%20Mercury%20News">San Jose Mercury News</a>" called the title character "the most interesting new character on television", also calling the episode "strange but marvellous". The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" Mike Antonucci wrote that the episode demonstrates that Carter "can blend subtle, complicated elements with heart-pounding action", adding that "Nothing is obvious about "The X-Files", in fact, except its quality". Michael Janusonis of "<a href="The%20Beaver%20County%20Times">The Beaver County Times</a>" was more critical, calling it "an acquired taste" and noting that it "sort of diddled out in the end", lacking "a completely satisfactory resolution".

Writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Keith Phipps rated the episode an A-, finding it "almost like an extension of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be "a rare thing indeed" on network television. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be "much more confident in its pacing and tone" than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it almost seems like a primer".

"Deep Throat" was cited as beginning to "set the stage for the central conflicts" of the series. "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" Dan Iverson felt that the episode served to "open the door to the possibilities of this series"; while <a href="Tor.com">Tor.com</a>'s Meghan Deans noted that "although the pilot introduced the idea of government conspiracy, it's 'Deep Throat' that kicks out the edges of the canvas". The introduction of Hardin as Deep Throat in the episode was listed by "Entertainment Weekly" as number 37 on its list of "The 100 Greatest Television Moments" of the 1990s.

Squeeze (The X-Files)

"Squeeze" is the third episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". It premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> on September 24, 1993. "Squeeze" was written by <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> and <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a> and directed by Harry Longstreet, with <a href="Michael%20Katleman">Michael Katleman</a> directing additional footage. The episode featured the first of two guest appearances by <a href="Doug%20Hutchison">Doug Hutchison</a> as the mutant serial killer <a href="Eugene%20Victor%20Tooms">Eugene Victor Tooms</a>, a role he would reprise in "<a href="Tooms">Tooms</a>". "Squeeze" is the first "monster-of-the-week" episode of "The X-Files", a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">series' overarching mythology</a>.

The show's main characters are <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of ritualistic killings by somebody seemingly capable of squeezing his body through impossibly narrow gaps. The agents deduce that their suspect may be a genetic mutant who has been killing in sprees for ninety years.

Production of "Squeeze" was problematic; creative differences between Longstreet and the crew led to him being replaced as director, while some missing scenes needed to be shot after the initial filming. Because of this turbulence, the completion of the episode relied on <a href="post-production">post-production</a> techniques. However, "Squeeze" has received positive reviews from critics, mostly focusing on Hutchison's performance and the resonance of his character. The episode has subsequently been described by "<a href="The%20Star%20%28Malaysia%29">The Star</a>" as "the episode that really sold "The X-Files" idea to the masses". Academics have examined "Squeeze" for its portrayal of the politics of law enforcement, highlighting the tension—evident throughout the series—between the agents' desire to find the truth and their duty to secure criminal convictions.

In <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, businessman George Usher arrives at his office building. He is watched from a <a href="storm%20drain">storm drain</a> by someone who then sneaks into the building by climbing through the elevator shaft into the ventilation system, and kills Usher by removing his <a href="liver">liver</a>. Usher's murder—the latest of three—is assigned to careerist <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agent Tom Colton (<a href="Donal%20Logue">Donal Logue</a>), who turns to <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) for help. Colton is baffled by the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the livers with bare hands. <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees from 1933 and 1963. At the scene, he notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds to be similar to some documented in the <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.

Because Scully believes that the killer will return to the scenes of his earlier crimes, she and Mulder wait in the parking garage of the office building. There, they catch a man named Eugene Victor Tooms (<a href="Doug%20Hutchison">Doug Hutchison</a>) climbing through the air vents. Tooms is given a <a href="polygraph%20test">polygraph test</a>, which includes questions written by Mulder linking him to murders dating as far back as 1903. Tooms passes most of the test, but crucially fails Mulder's questions placing Tooms at the historical murders. However, Colton dismisses Mulder's queries and lets Tooms go. To prove his assertion to Scully, Mulder digitally elongates and narrows Tooms' fingerprints, showing that they match the prints at the crime scene. Mulder believes that Tooms is able to stretch and squeeze his body through narrow spaces. That night, Tooms demonstrates this by squeezing down a chimney to claim another victim.

Mulder and Scully find no documentation on Tooms' life. They visit Frank Briggs (<a href="Henry%20Beckman">Henry Beckman</a>), a former detective, who recounts his experiences of the investigation into the 1933 murders. Briggs brings out old photographs of Tooms—who has not aged in sixty years—and gives them the address of Tooms' former apartment building. There, Mulder and Scully find a "nest" constructed out of newspaper and <a href="bile">bile</a> in the building's crawl space, as well as several <a href="wikt%3Atrophy">trophy items</a> taken from past victims. Mulder suspects that Tooms is a mutant who can hibernate for thirty years at a time after consuming five human livers. As the two leave, Tooms, who is hiding in the rafters, stealthily takes the necklace Scully is wearing as a new trophy.

Mulder and Scully put the apartment under surveillance, but Colton has them taken off the job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, he stares at the thin slot and grins.

Coming after two episodes focused on the series' "<a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">mythology</a>", or fictional history, "Squeeze" helped establish that the show could cover other <a href="paranormal">paranormal</a> subjects, and was the first "monster-of-the-week" episode of "The X-Files". Series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> thought that the show could not sustain its momentum unless it branched out from the previously UFO-centered plots. Co-writers <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> and <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a> were inspired to write the episode when they looked at a ventilation shaft outside of their office and thought about whether someone could crawl inside it. Although the episode has parallels with the second "" film, "<a href="The%20Night%20Strangler%20%28film%29">The Night Strangler</a>" (1973), which featured a man who commits murders every 21 years, Morgan and Wong have stated they were inspired by the serial killers <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> and <a href="Richard%20Ramirez">Richard Ramirez</a>. After eating <a href="foie%20gras">foie gras</a> during a trip to France, Carter proposed the idea that the villain should consume human livers. Morgan noted that the writers settled on the liver because it was "funnier" than any other organ. The idea to have Tooms use a nest for hibernation came from Morgan and Wong; they liked that if the agents were unable to catch Tooms, he could return after weeks of dormancy.

Actor Doug Hutchison was 33 when he auditioned for the part of Tooms, but the producers initially considered him too young for the role; Glen Morgan thought that Hutchinson "looks twelve years old". However Hutchison impressed the writers with his ability to suddenly transition into attacking behavior, which convinced them to hire him. He related that his portrayal of Tooms was inspired by the "stillness" of <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>' acting in "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>".

The episode's <a href="Establishing%20shot">establishing</a> exterior shots, and those of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night was meant to be of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the <a href="Pilot%20%28The%20X-Files%29">pilot episode</a>. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most <a href="reverse%20angle">reverse angle</a>s would show a large car park across the street.

Wong was disappointed with director Harry Longstreet, claiming he did not have respect for the script. Longstreet had failed to film one of the script's scenes, and had not obtained additional <a href="camera%20coverage">camera coverage</a> for the scenes which had been filmed. As a result, Wong and another director, <a href="Michael%20Katleman">Michael Katleman</a>, re-shot several scenes for additional coverage to complete the episode, and filmed the omitted scene and some <a href="Insert%20%28filmmaking%29">inserts</a>. Hutchison also had difficulty with Longstreet's directing; he found the acting instructions he was given "ridiculous". Morgan said that the episode's production was problematic, feeling that "Squeeze" "was truly saved in postproduction". Duchovny also found issue with Longstreet's direction, and disagreed with the director's take on how Fox Mulder should be portrayed. Describing their different opinions, Duchovny noted "the director wanted me to be mad about this horrible serial killer. I was like, 'No, this is an amazing discovery! He's not morally culpable, because he's genetically driven.' I judge no one".

For the shot in which Tooms slides through a chimney, the producers hired a contortionist who could squeeze through small spaces. They filmed the shot with the camera standing below the contortionist. The chimney, which was "more like a belt than a pipe", was made to look much narrower than it actually was. Using computer-generated imagery, they were able to produce and elongate shots of the contortionist's fingers. Producer <a href="R.%20W.%20Goodwin">R. W. Goodwin</a> believed that the contortionist—known only as "Pepper"—would only have limited success in fitting down the chimney set and would work mostly as a <a href="body%20double">photo double</a>. However, he was able to fit entirely inside the chimney; the production crew only needed to add some sound effects "of bones snapping and cracking".

The scene in which Tooms enters Scully's home was initially filmed in Hutchison's absence. The crew shot his entrance later, using a larger <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a> set. These shots were digitally merged so that Tooms would appear to emerge from a much smaller hatch than was filmed. The effect was kept to a minimum; Hutchison's footage was not "squeezed" too much, as both Carter and visual effects supervisor Mat Beck have stated their belief that "less is more: just a hint of the supernatural is all that is required".

Although it did not directly impact the ongoing storyline of "The X-Files", "Squeeze" introduced key thematic elements to the series. "Squeeze" has been described as "the episode where Dana Scully must publicly pick a side". She had previously confronted military officials in "<a href="Deep%20Throat%20%28The%20X-Files%20episode%29">Deep Throat</a>", and has "carefully worded" her reports to protect her partner Mulder from ridicule, but an encounter with former colleague Tom Colton forces her to openly choose between Mulder and the politics of careerism. These developments with Colton "[tether] another thread between her career and the rest of the FBI", highlighting a sense of "exasperation and derision" from her colleagues, whose mindsets represent "institutionally acceptable" models of reality.

This hostility suggests that the series' problems are "not epistemological; they are political"—the agents, Scully in particular, have to balance a search for "the truth" with the need to secure criminal convictions in their cases. This balancing act "between investigating to discover the truth and gathering evidence to support a court case" has been compared to the perceived stance of the FBI during the series' tenure. The bureau had at this time seen itself as a law enforcement agency responsible for amassing evidence to prosecute criminal cases. There is a disparity between this approach and public perception of the FBI's role as an organization investigating an objective and apolitical truth; this led to public frustration "because [people] incorrectly believe that a courtroom is designed to discover the truth".

"Squeeze" premiered on the Fox network on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on . The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately households and 11.1 million viewers. "Squeeze" earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 7.2, with a 13 share, meaning that roughly 7.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 13 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.

Glen Morgan was very pleased with Hutchison's performance, describing him as an "ace in the hole" and calling his work "outstanding". Morgan went on to write "Tooms", another first season episode in which the character returns. The <a href="Vince%20Gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a>-penned <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episode "<a href="Soft%20Light%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Soft Light</a>" would also make reference to the character. Hutchison wrote a prequel to "Squeeze" titled "Dark He Was and Golden-Eyed" and sent it to Carter, but the script was returned unread for legal reasons. "Squeeze" has been described as the first episode of "The X-Files" to branch out into horror, which came to be one of the defining genres of "The X-Files". The plot of "Squeeze" was adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by <a href="Ellen%20Steiber">Ellen Steiber</a>. The episode also inspired "Folding Man", a <a href="Sanctuary%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> episode of the television series "<a href="Sanctuary%20%28TV%20series%29">Sanctuary</a>".

In a retrospective of the first season in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", "Squeeze" was rated B+; it was called "an important episode", and Hutchison's portrayal of Tooms was described as "profoundly creepy". However, Thomas Sutcliffe of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" was more critical, deriding the premise as "entirely ludicrous", and sarcastically described Mulder's deduction of Tooms' abilities as "clearly another triumph for the deductive method". An article in the "<a href="Vancouver%20Sun">Vancouver Sun</a>" listed "Squeeze" as one of the best stand-alone episodes of the show, saying, ""The X-Files" became known for its creepy, monster-of-the-week episodes, and Squeeze was the one that started it all", and that, together with "Tooms", it "remains one of the scariest things ever seen on television". Connie Ogle from <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> listed Tooms amongst the greatest monsters of the series.

Keith Phipps, writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", praised the episode, rated it an A−, and described Hutchison's role as "the part that would launch [him] as a go-to character actor for creep parts". Phipps felt the climactic scene in which Tooms infiltrates Scully's home is "the scene that makes the episode", noting that there was "a real sense of peril" despite it being clear that Scully, a lead character, was not going to come to harm. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", note that the episode's premise is the first in the series "not to rely upon accepted urban legends". It conveys its "absurd" plot through suggestion, leaving any special-effects sequences of Tooms' abilities until the audience is "already suitably adjusted to the absurdity". However, Shearman and Pearson found the monologue likening the crimes committed by Tooms to the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, given by the retired detective Briggs, to be "not only unnecessary but tasteless to boot". They rated the episode four stars out of five. Mumtaj Begum, writing for Malaysia's "<a href="The%20Star%20%28Malaysia%29">The Star</a>", described "Squeeze" as "the episode that really sold "The X-Files" idea to the masses", and called it "simply brilliant".

The character of Eugene Tooms has also attracted positive criticism. In a guest column for "Entertainment Weekly"s 1000th issue, author <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> listed Tooms as one of his favorite monsters, while <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO Networks</a> listed the character in a countdown of the "Best TV Serial Killers", and described Hutchison's acting as "uber-creepy". <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Christine Seghers listed Hutchison as the fourth-best guest star of the series in a top-ten countdown, complimented his "brilliantly perverse" performance, and wrote: "Even when he doesn't appear to be doing anything, Hutchinson [sic] can still make your skin crawl with his dead, shark-like stare".

The debut broadcast of "Ice" was watched by 10 million viewers in 6.2 million households and received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised its tense atmosphere.

The plot of the episode sees <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) investigate the deaths of an Alaskan research team.

The episode was inspired by an article in "<a href="Science%20News">Science News</a>" about an excavation in Greenland, and series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> also cited <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>'s 1938 novella "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>" as an influence. Although the producers hoped that "Ice" would save money by being shot in a single location, it ended up exceeding its production budget.

A mass <a href="murder%E2%80%93suicide">murder–suicide</a> occurs among a team of <a href="geophysics">geophysicists</a> at an outpost in <a href="Icy%20Cape%2C%20Alaska">Icy Cape, Alaska</a>. <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) head for the outpost, accompanied by physician Dr. Hodge (<a href="Xander%20Berkeley">Xander Berkeley</a>); <a href="toxicology">toxicologist</a> Dr. Da Silva (<a href="Felicity%20Huffman">Felicity Huffman</a>); geologist Dr. Murphy (<a href="Steve%20Hytner">Steve Hytner</a>) and Bear (<a href="Jeff%20Kober">Jeff Kober</a>), their pilot. With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, which attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects that it may be infected with <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on the bodies of the scientists.

Murphy finds an <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a> sample believed to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes that the sample might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a <a href="stool%20sample">stool sample</a>, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm from the back of his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.

The worm removed from Bear is kept in a jar, and another is recovered from one of the scientists' bodies. Mulder (believing that the worms are extraterrestrial) wants them kept alive, but Scully feels that they should be destroyed to prevent infection. The group check each other for black nodules and find none, although Mulder reminds Scully that the nodules disappeared from the dog over time. When Mulder finds Murphy in the freezer with his throat cut, the others (including Scully) believe that he has become infected and killed Murphy. Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.

Scully discovers that two worms put together will kill each other. When the investigators place one of the worms into the infected dog, it recovers. Against Scully's objections, Hodge and Da Silva try to place the other worm into Mulder and Hodge realizes that Da Silva is the true infected person. He and Mulder restrain the hysterical Da Silva and place the last worm inside her. When they are rescued, Da Silva and the dog are quarantined and the others are released. Although Mulder wants to return to the site, he is told that it has been destroyed by the government.

<a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> began writing the episode after he read a "<a href="Science%20News">Science News</a>" article about men in Greenland who found a 250,000-year-old item encased in ice. The setting—an icy, remote research base overcome by an extraterrestrial creature—is similar to that of <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>'s 1938 novella "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>" and its two feature-film incarnations: "<a href="The%20Thing%20from%20Another%20World">The Thing from Another World</a>" (1951), directed by <a href="Christian%20Nyby">Christian Nyby</a> and produced by <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>, and "<a href="The%20Thing%20%281982%20film%29">The Thing</a>" (1982), directed by <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>. Chris Carter has cited them as the main inspirations for the episode. As in the novella and films, the characters cannot trust each other because they are uncertain if they are who they seem to be. Carter particularly enjoyed this aspect, because it pitted Mulder and Scully against each other and provided "a new look on their characters early on in the series".

The episode's premise became a recurring theme in the series, with episodes such as "<a href="Darkness%20Falls%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Darkness Falls</a>" and "<a href="Firewalker%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Firewalker</a>" repeating the combination of remote locations and unknown lifeforms. A similar plot was featured in "", a 1995 episode of Morgan and his writing partner <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a>'s series "", and according to <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO Networks</a> the "<a href="Fringe%20%28TV%20series%29">Fringe</a>" episode "<a href="What%20Lies%20Below">What Lies Below</a>" has "basically" the same plot as "Ice". The episode introduced invertebrate parasites as antagonists in the series; this plot device would recur in "Firewalker", "<a href="The%20Host%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Host</a>", "<a href="F.%20Emasculata">F. Emasculata</a>" and "<a href="Roadrunners%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Roadrunners</a>".

The similarity to Carpenter's version of "The Thing" was due in part to new production designer Graeme Murray, who worked on Carpenter's film and created the complex in which the episode took place. Although "Ice" was intended as a <a href="bottle%20episode">bottle episode</a> which would save money by being shot in a single location, it went over budget. According to Carter, "The X-Files" typically worked from a small budget and "every dollar we spend ends up on the screen". As a bottle episode, "Ice" used a small cast and its interiors were filmed on a set constructed at an old <a href="Molson">Molson</a> brewery site. The episode's few exterior shots were filmed at <a href="Delta/Delta%20Heritage%20Air%20Park">Delta Air Park</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, whose hangars and flat terrain simulated an Arctic location. Carter said that he would have preferred to set the episode at the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>, but he believed that this was unfeasible at the time.

For the worm effect, one member of the special effects department suggested putting a "baby snake" in a latex suit. After explaining that that couldn't be done, animal trainer Debbie Coe suggested using a "<a href="Zophobas%20morio">super mealworm</a>" to achieve the desired effect. The effect of the worms crawling in the host bodies was achieved with wires under fake skins, including a skin with hair for the dog. Digital effects were used for scenes involving the worms swimming in jars and entering the dog's ear. Although extra footage of the worm scenes was shot so they would last as long as intended if <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>'s standards-and-practices officials asked for cuts, no edits were requested. "Ice" was the first significant role in the series for makeup effects artist <a href="Toby%20Lindala">Toby Lindala</a>, who become its chief makeup artist. The dog used in the episode was a parent of Duchovny's dog, Blue. <a href="Ken%20Kirzinger">Ken Kirzinger</a>, who played one of the scientists killed in the episode's <a href="cold%20open">cold open</a>, was the series' <a href="stunt%20coordinator">stunt coordinator</a>.

Although "Ice" is not directly connected to the <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">series' overarching mythology</a>, it has been described as "a portent to the alien conspiracy arc which would become more pronounced in the second season" with its themes of alien invasion and governmental conspiracy. The episode is noted for exploring the relationship between its lead characters; Mulder and Scully's trust contrasts with the behavior of Hodge and DaSilva, who are united by a distrust of those around them. The pairs are "mirror images" in their approaches to partnership.

"Ice" features two elements common to other works by Morgan and Wong: dual identities and the questioning of one's personality. In her essay "Last Night We Had an Omen", Leslie Jones noted this thematic leitmotif in several of their other "X-Files" scripts: "the meek animal-control inspector who is a mutant shape-shifter with a taste for human liver ["<a href="Squeeze%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Squeeze</a>"], the hapless residents of rural Pennsylvania driven mad by a combination of insecticides and electronic equipment ["<a href="Blood%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Blood</a>"], [and] the uptight PTA run by practicing Satanists ["<a href="Die%20Hand%20Die%20Verletzt">Die Hand Die Verletzt</a>"]".

<a href="Anne%20Simon">Anne Simon</a>, a biology professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a>, discussed the episode in her book "Monsters, Mutants and Missing Links: The Real Science Behind the X-Files". Simon noted that like the worms in "Ice", parasitic worms can attach to the human <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> because it is not blocked by the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>. She compared "Ice" to the later episodes "<a href="Tunguska%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Tunguska</a>" and "<a href="Gethsemane%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Gethsemane</a>", with their common theme of extraterrestrial life reaching earth through <a href="panspermia">panspermia</a>.

"Ice" originally aired on the Fox network on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on . The episode's initial American broadcast received a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 6.6 with an 11 share; about of all households with television and of households watching TV viewed the episode, a total of households and 10 million viewers. "Ice" and "<a href="Conduit%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Conduit</a>" were released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in 1996, and the episode was released on DVD as part of the complete first season.

"Ice" was praised by critics. In "The Complete X-Files", authors Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles called the episode a milestone for the fledgling series. An "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" first-season retrospective graded "Ice" as A−, calling it "particularly taut and briskly paced". On "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Keith Phipps praised the episode and gave it an A. According to Phipps, the cast "plays the paranoia beautifully" and the episode was "as fine an hour as this first season would produce". "Ice" was included on an "A.V. Club" list of greatest bottle episodes, where it was described as "us[ing] its close quarters as an advantage". A third "A.V. Club" article, listing ten "must-see" episodes of the series, called "Ice" "the first sign that this show had a shot at really being something special" and said that it "makes great use of claustrophobia and the uneasy but growing alliance between the heroes".

"<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>"s Ben Rawson-Jones described the episode's stand-off between Mulder and Scully as "an extremely tense moment of paranoia." A New York "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" review called the episode "potent and creepy", and said that its plot "was worthy of honorary passage into "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>"". Matt Haigh called it "an extremely absorbing and thrilling episode" on the <a href="Dennis%20Publishing">Den of Geek</a> website, noting its debt to "The Thing", and Juliette Harrisson called "Ice" the "finest" stand-alone episode of the first season. On the <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a> blog, Anna Johns called it "a spectacular episode" with an "excellent" opening. UGO Networks called the episode's worms among the series' best "Monsters-of-the-Week" and the cause of "much pointed-guns aggression". In <a href="Tor.com">Tor.com</a>, Meghan Deans compared the scene where Mulder and Scully inspect each other for infection to a similar scene in "<a href="Pilot%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Pilot</a>"; in "Ice", both characters were equally vulnerable and (unlike the pilot scene) Scully was not portrayed as "an idiot". <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave the episode five out of five stars. They called it "the most influential episode ever made", noting that the series reprised its formula several times during its run. Shearman felt that although their script was derivative, Morgan and Wong created "a pivotal story" by combining crucial themes from "The Thing" with a "well rounded" cast of characters.

"Ice" was also considered one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: "The real great thing about 'Ice' is that we were able to convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".

Gender Bender (The X-Files)

"Gender Bender" is the fourteenth episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". Premiering on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on , it was written by Larry and Paul Barber, directed by <a href="Rob%20Bowman%20%28filmmaker%29">Rob Bowman</a>, and featured guest appearances by Brent Hinkley and <a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>, who would later appear in the recurring role of <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a>. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to <a href="mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">the series' overarching mythology</a>.

The show centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. In this episode, Mulder and Scully begin investigating a series of murders following sexual encounters. The two soon discover that a member of a religious sect living in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> may be responsible—and may not be human.

The episode was inspired by producer <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a>'s desire for "an episode with more of a sexy edge"; the writers found it difficult to write a story that showed sex as scary and introduced an <a href="Amish">Amish</a>-like community as well. "Gender Bender" was seen by approximately 6.8 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode has subsequently been met with mixed critical responses, facing criticism for its abrupt "<a href="deus%20ex%20machina">deus ex machina</a>" ending. Academic analysis of the episode has placed it within a science-fiction tradition that attributes a powerful, supernatural element to physical contact with aliens. It has also been seen as reflecting anxieties about emerging <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s in the 1990s.

In a dance club, a young man is taken by a young woman, Marty (<a href="Kate%20Twa">Kate Twa</a>), for <a href="casual%20sex">casual sex</a>. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (<a href="Peter%20Stebbings">Peter Stebbings</a>). <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) are called to the scene; Mulder believes that the man's death was caused by a fatal dose of <a href="pheromones">pheromones</a>. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an <a href="Amish">Amish</a>-like community in Steveston, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, which Mulder calls the Kindred.

Mulder approaches some of the Kindred, only to be shunned. Meanwhile, Scully befriends a member, Brother Andrew (<a href="Brent%20Hinkley">Brent Hinkley</a>), who is reluctant to talk. While shaking hands with him, Scully appears entranced, not coming to until Mulder catches her attention. The agents visit the Kindred's remote community, where they are asked to surrender their guns before entering. Mulder and Scully are invited to dinner. When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred take care of their own. Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl to dance with him by touching her hand.

When the Kindred escort the agents out of the village, Mulder comments on the lack of children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims to be able to give her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.

Another man, Michel (<a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>), is having sex with the female form of Brother Martin in a parked car before a patrol officer interrupts them. As Michel suddenly starts retching, the officer is attacked by Brother Martin, who changes into a man and escapes. In the hospital Michel reluctantly reveals to Mulder and Scully that when he looked out of the car, the girl he was with "looked like a man". The agents are alerted about activity on a previous victim's credit card, which was stolen by Brother Martin. The agents chase Brother Martin into an alley, only to have the Kindred appear and take him away. The following morning the agents return to the Kindred's dwelling, which now appears deserted. The tunnels are blocked entirely with the white clay. Mulder and Scully walk into the nearby field where they find a large <a href="crop%20circle">crop circle</a>, suggesting that the Kindred are aliens.

While discussing the installment's origins, producer <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> said that he "wanted an episode with more of a sexy edge". It proved difficult to portray sex as convincingly scary, which caused the producers to introduce the concept of "people like the Amish who are from another planet". "Gender Bender" was penned by freelance writers Larry and Paul Barber, whose initial draft focused heavily on the contrast between the farming community of the Kindred and a version of city life "with very sexual connotations", influenced by the works of Swiss artist <a href="H.%20R.%20Giger">H. R. Giger</a>. This script went through various rewrites during the development process, including the removal of a scene where someone's crotch rots away, to address concerns about the content of the episode. The chants uttered by the Kindred were not in the script handed in by the Barbers; they were added later by producer <a href="Paul%20Rabwin">Paul Rabwin</a>.

The character of Marty was portrayed by two actors—Kate Twa plays its female form and <a href="Peter%20Stebbings">Peter Stebbings</a> the male. Twa was the first of the two to be cast, leading producer <a href="R.%20W.%20Goodwin">R. W. Goodwin</a> to base the casting of Stebbings mostly on his "very strong resemblance" to the actress. This resemblance was exploited in a scene showing Twa <a href="morphing">morphing</a> into Stebbings; Goodwin felt that the two actors were too similar for the effect to be readily apparent, "zapp[ing] the energy out of the moment". Nicholas Lea, who played a would-be victim in the episode, returned to the series in a recurring role as <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a>, beginning with the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>'s "<a href="Sleepless%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Sleepless</a>". Twa also returned that season, playing a former colleague of Scully in "<a href="Soft%20Light%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Soft Light</a>".

"Gender Bender" marked <a href="Rob%20Bowman%20%28filmmaker%29">Rob Bowman</a>'s directorial debut on the series; he became one of the series' most prolific directors, even directing the 1998 film adaptation, "<a href="The%20X-Files%20%28film%29">The X-Files: Fight the Future</a>". Bowman found "Gender Bender" a difficult episode to work on—the script had initially called for lantern light to illuminate several scenes, but this was found to be unworkable. In addition, an interior set constructed to represent the catacombs under the Kindred's barn was so encumbering to film in that a <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> crew were required to reshoot a large degree of <a href="camera%20coverage">camera coverage</a>. This need for extra footage necessitated an additional day of filming for scenes featuring Duchovny.

The exterior shots of the village inhabited by the Kindred were filmed at a farm preserved from the 1890s in <a href="Langley%2C%20British%20Columbia%20%28city%29">Langley, British Columbia</a>, while interior sets were built on a sound stage. The small town visited by the agents was filmed on location in <a href="Steveston%2C%20British%20Columbia">Steveston, British Columbia</a>—a location which was revisited to film the first-season episode "<a href="Miracle%20Man%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Miracle Man</a>". The music used in the episode's nightclub scenes was recycled from composer <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a>'s earlier work on the television film "".

"Gender Bender" has been interpreted as representing contemporary sexual anxieties in a figurative manner, conflating seduction with alien abduction. M. Keith Booker has described the Kindred's shapeshifting as representative of contemporary sexual anxieties caused by the changing <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s of the decade, coupled with "a basic fear of sexual contact". Antonio Ballesteros González has stated that the episode is representative of the series' exploration of both seduction and abduction, noting that "both are seen as part of sexual aggression", further describing the episode's villain as representing "the fear of sex and reproduction". The lethal nature of the Kindred's touch has been cited as representing the potency of their <a href="sexual%20repression">sexual repression</a>; and has been placed within a science-fiction tradition that depicts aliens or outsiders with a potent touch, alongside similar depictions in the films "<a href="Communion%20%281989%20film%29">Communion</a>" and "<a href="E.T.%20The%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T.</a>", and the novel "<a href="The%20Puppet%20Masters">The Puppet Masters</a>".

"Gender Bender" originally aired on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on . The episode earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen household rating</a> of 7.2, with a 12 share. It was viewed by households and 11.1 million viewers, meaning that roughly of all television-equipped households, and of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.

"Gender Bender" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed "Gender Bender" positively, feeling that it was "a nicely refreshing and original idea", with "strikingly atmospheric" sets and "impressively spooky" villains. Zack Handlen, writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", praised the episode, awarding it an "A". He felt that the plot was "a perfect mixture of scientific theory, unsubstantiated rumor, and memorable visuals". Handlen felt that the episode represented the ideal plot for "The X-Files", featuring someone briefly interacting with supernatural phenomena without ever learning the truth of their experience. Anna Johns, writing for <a href="Weblogs%2C%20Inc.%23TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>, was positive toward the episode. Johns stated she "totally loved it".

In a retrospective of the first season in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", "Gender Bender" was rated "B−", being described as a "clever idea" that was "undermined by a bushel of burning questions". <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated "Gender Bender" one-and-a-half stars out of five, finding that it "finishes up ... entirely clichéd". Shearman felt that Bowman's direction, and the contrast between "decadent" night-life and the "restraint and denial" of the Kindred, were highlights of the episode. He also felt that it approached its themes too conservatively and tamely, leaving a "boring" end result. In his book "The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes", author <a href="Phil%20Farrand">Phil Farrand</a> has highlighted several inconsistencies in the episode, focusing on the implausible nature of the ending. Farrand cites the mention of the Kindred's pheromones containing human DNA and their use of the English language when in private as elements which seem incongruous for an alien race.

The episode faced criticism from the crew over its ending using a "<a href="deus%20ex%20machina">deus ex machina</a>" to indicate that the Kindred may have been aliens. Producer <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a> felt that the episode's ending seemed overly abrupt and unexpected, describing it as appearing "like we tried to play a trick on the audience to make them say 'Ooh, what the heck was that?. He added that the lack of a real connection to the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of catharsis for the viewer. Morgan said that the episode "went too far. At what point do we become unbelievable?" When asked about the similarity between the Kindred and the Amish, series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> noted that "they [the Amish] don't watch TV, so I wasn't worried about it".

To the People of Texas &amp; All Americans in the World

To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World is an <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> written on February 24, 1836, by <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a>, commander of the <a href="Texian">Texian</a> forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a>, to settlers in <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a>. The letter is renowned as a "declaration of defiance" and a "masterpiece of American patriotism", and forms part of the history education of Texas schoolchildren.

On February 23, the <a href="Alamo%20Mission">Alamo Mission</a> in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a> had been besieged by Mexican forces led by General <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>. Fearing that his small group of men could not withstand an assault, Travis wrote this letter seeking reinforcements and supplies from supporters. The letter closes with Travis's vow of "Victory or Death!", an emotion which has been both praised and derided by historians.

The letter was initially entrusted to courier <a href="Albert%20Martin%20%28soldier%29">Albert Martin</a>, who carried it to the town of <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a> some seventy miles away. Martin added several postscripts to encourage men to reinforce the Alamo, and then handed the letter to Launcelot Smithers. Smithers added his own postscript and delivered the letter to its intended destination, <a href="San%20Felipe%2C%20Texas">San Felipe de Austin</a>. Local publishers printed over 700 copies of the letter. It also appeared in the two main Texas newspapers and was eventually printed throughout the United States and Europe. Partially in response to the letter, men from throughout Texas and the United States began to gather in Gonzales. Between 32 and 90 of them reached the Alamo before it fell; the remainder formed the nucleus of the army which eventually defeated Santa Anna at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a>.

Following the end of the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, the original letter was delivered to Travis's family in Alabama, and in 1893, one of his descendants sold it to the <a href="State%20of%20Texas">State of Texas</a> for $85 ($ today). For many decades it was displayed at the Texas State Library; the original letter is now protected and a copy is on display under a portrait of Travis.

The Mexican <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> liberalized the country's immigration policies, allowing foreigners to settle in border regions such as <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a>. People flocked to the area; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7,800 Mexicans and 30,000 English-speaking people primarily from the United States. Among the immigrants was <a href="William%20Barret%20Travis">William Barret Travis</a>, an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer. An avid reader, Travis often devoured a novel in a single day. His taste ran primarily to <a href="romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romantic</a> adventure and history, especially the novels of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> and the historical works of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>. Historians have speculated that Travis's choice of reading material may have affected his behavior—Travis was known for his melodramatic ways.
In May 1831, Travis opened a law office in <a href="Anahuac%2C%20Texas">Anahuac, Texas</a>. Almost immediately, he and his law partner, <a href="Patrick%20Jack">Patrick Jack</a>, clashed with the local military commander, <a href="Juan%20Davis%20Bradburn">Juan Davis Bradburn</a>. Their subsequent actions were instrumental in causing the May 1832 <a href="Anahuac%20Disturbances">Anahuac Disturbances</a>. According to historian <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a>, Bradburn "overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction". Bradburn was forced to resign his post and flee Texas.

The Anahuac Disturbances coincided with a Mexican civil war. <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s aligned themselves with proponents of <a href="federalism">federalism</a> advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a <a href="centralized%20government">centralized government</a> that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and he was forced to apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.

Texians became increasingly discontented with the government as Santa Anna positioned himself as a dictator. In October, the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> began and delegates appointed a <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">provisional government</a>. Travis was commissioned lieutenant colonel in the new <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> and asked to raise a cavalry company. He participated in the <a href="Siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">Siege of Béxar</a>, where he proved to be "an impulsive, occasionally insubordinate, officer".

By the end of 1835, Texians had expelled all Mexican troops from Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; despite a lack of authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, the legislature impeached Governor <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a>, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.

Even as Texian governmental authority declined, rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead an invasion of Texas to quell the rebellion. Despite this news, Texian army strength continued to dwindle. Texas settlers were divided on whether they were fighting for independence or a return to a federalist government in Mexico. The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home. Fewer than 100 Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the <a href="Alamo%20Mission">Alamo Mission</a> in San Antonio de Béxar (now <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>). Their commander, <a href="James%20C.%20Neill">James C. Neill</a>, feared that his small force would be unable to withstand an assault by the Mexican troops. In response to Neill's repeated requests for reinforcements, Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo; they arrived on February 3. Most of the Texians, including Travis, believed that any Mexican invasion was months away.

Travis assumed command of the Alamo garrison on February 11, when Neill was granted a furlough. On February 23, Santa Anna arrived in Béxar at the head of approximately 1500 Mexican troops. The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development. As they rushed to the Alamo, Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a <a href="siege%20of%20the%20Alamo">siege of the Alamo</a> and raised a blood-red flag signalling <a href="no%20quarter">no quarter</a>. Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon.

The first night of the siege was largely quiet. The following afternoon, Mexican artillery began firing on the Alamo. Mexican Colonel <a href="Juan%20Almonte">Juan Almonte</a> wrote in his diary that the bombardment dismounted two of the Alamo's guns, including the massive 18-pounder cannon. The Texians quickly returned both weapons to service. Shortly after, Travis wrote an <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> pleading for reinforcements from "the people of Texas & All Americans in the World".

To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World:

Fellow citizens & compatriots—I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—""Victory or Death".

William Barret Travis

Lt. Col. comdt

P.S. The Lord is on our side—When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn—We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves.

Travis

Travis entrusted the letter to courier Albert Martin, who rode through the night to cover the to the closest town, <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a>, as quickly as possible. During his journey, Martin added two postscripts. The first relayed Martin's fear that the Mexican army had already attacked the Alamo and ended "Hurry on all the men you can in haste". The second postscript is more difficult to read, as the letter was later folded along one line of text. The paper has since partially frayed along the fold, obliterating several words. The gist of the message, however, is that the men at the Alamo were "determined to do or die", and Martin intended to gather reinforcements and return as quickly as possible.

In Gonzales, Martin turned the letter over to Launcelot Smithers. When the Mexican army arrived in Béxar, Smithers had immediately set out for Gonzales. Travis may have sent him as an official courier, or he may have journeyed there on his own to warn the townspeople. Smithers added his own message under Martin's, encouraging men to gather in Gonzales to go to the relief of the Texians at the Alamo.

Before departing Gonzales, Smithers gave a letter to <a href="Andrew%20Ponton">Andrew Ponton</a>, the "<a href="alcalde">alcalde</a>" (or mayor) of the town. This second letter may have actually been the reason Smithers travelled to Gonzales, or it might have been a paraphrased version of the letter Martin had delivered. The copy read:

To All the Inhabitants of Texas:

In a few words there is 2000 Mexican soldiers in Bexar, and 150 Americans in the Alamo. Sesma is at the head of them, and from best accounts that can be obtained, they intend to show no quarter. If every man cannot turn out to a man every man in the Alamo will be murdered.

They have not more than 8 or 10 days provisions. They say they will defend it or die on the ground. Provisions, ammunition and Men, or suffer your men to be murdered in the Fort. If you do not turn out Texas is gone. I left Bexar on the 23rd at 4 P.M.
By order of
W.V. ["sic"] Travis
L. Smithers
Ponton sent the Smithers copy of the letter to Colonel Henry Raguet, the commander of the Committee of Vigilance and Safety in <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20TX">Nacogdoches</a>. Raguet kept the letter he received and sent a copy, with his additional comments, to Dr. <a href="John%20Sibley%20%28doctor%29">John Sibley</a>, the chairman of the Committee of Vigilance and Safety for Texas Affairs in <a href="Natchitoches%2C%20Louisiana">Natchitoches, Louisiana</a>.

Smithers rode hard and delivered Travis's letter to <a href="San%20Felipe%20de%20Austin%2C%20TX">San Felipe de Austin</a> in fewer than 40 hours. In a hurriedly organized meeting, town leaders passed a series of resolutions pledging assistance to the Alamo defenders. The results of the meeting were printed in a <a href="broadsheet">broadsheet</a> alongside a reproduction of Travis's letter. After distributing all 200 copies of their initial print run, newspaper publishers <a href="Joseph%20Baker%20%28newspaperman%29">Joseph Baker</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Borden">Thomas Borden</a> made at least four other reproductions of the letter, resulting in more than 500 additional copies. Their final printing included a message from Governor <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a> urging the colonists "to fly to the aid of your besieged countrymen and not permit them to be massacred by a mercenary foe. ... The call is upon ALL who are able to bear arms, to rally without one moment's delay, or in fifteen days the heart of Texas will be the seat of war." On March 2, the letter was printed in the "Texas Republican". It appeared in the other major Texas newspaper, the "<a href="Telegraph%20and%20Texas%20Register">Telegraph and Texas Register</a>", three days later. The letter was eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe.

This letter was one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texans needed more men and ammunition to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the <a href="Convention%20of%201836">Convention of 1836</a> to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.

Many Texas residents disagreed with the convention's perception. As the message spread across Texas, settlers left their homes and assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel <a href="James%20Fannin">James Fannin</a> was due to arrive with the remaining Texan Army troops. On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently set out on their own; as a result 32 additional Texans entered the Alamo. Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4.

Almost all of the Texans were killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a> when the Mexican army attacked on March 6; Travis was likely the first to die. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, reinforcements continued to assemble; over 400 Texans were waiting in Gonzales when news of the Texan defeat reached the town on March 11. Earlier that day, General <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, newly reappointed commander of the Texan Army, had arrived in Gonzales. On hearing of the Alamo's fall, Houston took command of the assembled volunteers. The following month, this hastily organized army defeated Santa Anna at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a>, ending the Texas Revolution.

This letter may have influenced the election of <a href="David%20G.%20Burnet">David G. Burnet</a> as interim president of the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. After reading one of the broadsheet versions of the letter, Burnet rushed to join Travis at the Alamo. After stopping at <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a> to recruit reinforcements from the men assembled at the Convention of 1836, Burnet became so "inspired by their deliberations" that he remained as a visitor. The convention declared independence from Mexico on March 2, but delegates feared for the safety of the new country's officers. Speaking privately with many of the delegates, Burnet professed his willingness to serve as president of a new republic, even if that made him a target of Santa Anna. The most popular delegates were absent from the convention on other business for the war effort. In the absence of interest in the position from most of those remaining, Burnet was nominated for president and defeated the only other candidate, Samuel Carson, by a 29–23 margin.

After the Texas Revolution ended, the original draft of the letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians are known to have visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five at the time of his death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the <a href="state%20of%20Texas">state of Texas</a> for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.

For many decades, the letter was publicly displayed, usually in a locked glass case with other manuscripts and artifacts from the Texas Revolution. At times, it was arranged alongside the Travis family Bible and a copy of Travis's will. In 1909, the letter was moved to the <a href="Texas%20State%20Library%20and%20Archives%20Commission">Texas State Library</a> and has since left that building only twice; it was among 143 documents lent to the Committee on Historical Exhibits for the <a href="Texas%20Centennial%20Exposition">Texas Centennial Exposition</a> in 1936, and it returned briefly to the site of the exposition in 1986. The original letter is no longer on permanent display. In its place is, in the words of Michael Green, former reference archivist for the Texas State Library Archives Division, "an exacting, one-of-a-kind facsimile". Directly over its display case is a portrait of Travis.

Four copies of the original broadsides are known to survive. One was placed for auction in 2004, where it was predicted to reach a price of over $250,000.

In October 2012, the Texas General Land Office announced plans to display the famous Travis Letter in the Alamo from February 23 to March 7, 2013. This marked the first time the iconic letter has returned to the Alamo since it was written by Travis. The display was free and open to the general public.

Travis' letter is regarded as "the most famous document in Texas history", but its widespread distribution allowed an impact outside the relatively isolated settlements in Texas. Historians place the letter in a broader context, "as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism" or even "one of the greatest declarations of defiance in the English language". It is rare to see a book about the Alamo or the Texas Revolution which does not quote the letter, either in full or part. The letter also appears in full in most Texas history textbooks geared towards elementary and middle school children. The postscripts, however, have rarely been printed. Despite its asserted impact, minimal scholarship exists on the letter itself.

Almost from the moment of his arrival in Texas, Travis had attempted to influence the war agenda in Texas. As he realized the magnitude of the opposition he faced at the Alamo, the tone of Travis's writings shifted from perfunctory reports to the provisional government to more eloquent messages aimed at a wider audience. With limited time and opportunity to sway people to his way of thinking, Travis's success, and perhaps his very survival, would depend on his ability to ""emotionally move" the people". His previous work as a journalist likely gave him a good understanding of the type of language that would most resonate with his intended audience. Travis used this particular letter not only as a means to publicize his immediate need for reinforcements and supplies, but also to shape the debate within Texas by offering "a well-crafted provocation" that might incite others to take up arms. He chose "unambiguous and defiant" language, resulting in a "very powerful" message. The letter represented an unofficial declaration of independence for Texas. Its word usage evoked the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>'s famed cry of "<a href="Give%20me%20Liberty%2C%20or%20give%20me%20Death%21">Liberty or Death!</a>"

Critics have derided the letter for its emotionalism, noting that it appears to show "a preoccupation with romance and chivalry" not uncommon to fans of Sir Walter Scott. In particular, they point to Travis's asserted determination to sacrifice his own life for a lost cause.

Blockhaus d'Éperlecques

The Blockhaus d'Éperlecques (, also referred to as "the Watten bunker" or simply "Watten") is a <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> <a href="bunker">bunker</a>, now part of a museum, near <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a> in the northern <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20France">"département"</a> of France, and only some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) north-northwest from the more developed <a href="La%20Coupole">La Coupole</a> V-2 launch facility, in the same general area. The bunker, built by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> under the <a href="codename">codename</a> Kraftwerk Nord West (Powerplant Northwest) between March 1943 and July 1944, was originally intended to be a launching facility for the <a href="V-2">V-2</a> (A-4) <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>. It was designed to accommodate over 100 missiles at a time and to launch up to 36 daily.

The facility would have incorporated a <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> factory and a bomb-proof train station to allow missiles and supplies to be delivered from production facilities in Germany. It was constructed using the labour of thousands of prisoners of war and forcibly conscripted workers used as slave labourers.

The bunker was never completed as a result of the repeated bombing by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">British</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States air forces</a> as part of <a href="Operation%20Crossbow">Operation Crossbow</a> against the German V-weapons programme. The attacks caused substantial damage and rendered the bunker unusable for its original purpose. Part of the bunker was subsequently completed for use as a liquid oxygen factory. It was captured by Allied forces at the start of September 1944, though its true purpose was not discovered by the Allies until after the war. V-2s were instead launched from "<a href="Meillerwagen">Meillerwagen</a>"-based mobile batteries which were far less vulnerable to aerial attacks.

Today, the bunker is preserved as part of a privately-owned museum that presents the history of the site and the German V-weapons programme. It has been protected by the French state as a "<a href="monument%20historique">monument historique</a>" since 1986.

The <a href="Aggregate%20%28rocket%20family%29%23A4%20%28V-2%20rocket%29">A-4 ballistic missile</a> (referred to as the V-2 from September 1944) was developed by the Germans between 1939 and 1944. It was regarded by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> as a "<a href="Wunderwaffe">Wunderwaffe</a>" (wonder weapon) that he believed to be capable of turning the tide of the war. Its operational deployment was restricted by several factors. Large supplies of cryogenic liquid oxygen (LOX) were required as the <a href="oxidizer">oxidizer</a> to fuel the missiles. LOX evaporates rapidly, necessitating a source reasonably close to the firing site in order to minimise loss through evaporation. Germany and the occupied countries did not at that time have sufficient manufacturing capacity for the amount of LOX required for a full-scale A-4 campaign; the total production capacity in 1941 and 1942 was about 215 tons daily, but each A-4 launch required about 15 tons.

As the missile was intended for use against London and southern England, its operational range of meant that the launch sites had to be located fairly close to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> or southern <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> coasts, in northern France, Belgium or the western Netherlands. This was within easy reach of the Allied air forces, so any site would have to be able to resist or evade the expected aerial bombardments.

Various concepts were mooted for the A-4's deployment in a March 1942 study by <a href="Walter%20Dornberger">Walter Dornberger</a>, the head of the A-4 development project at the <a href="Peenem%C3%BCnde%20Army%20Research%20Center">Peenemünde Army Research Center</a>. He suggested that the missiles should be based in heavily defended fixed sites of a bunker-style design similar to the massive <a href="submarine%20pen">submarine pen</a>s then under construction in occupied France and Norway. The rockets could be stored in such sites, armed, fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant, and launched. This offered significant technical advantages; not only would the LOX loss be minimised, but the complex process of pre-launch testing would be simplified. A high rate of fire could be sustained as the facility could effectively operate like a production line, sending a steady flow of missiles to the launch pads.

The submarine pens and other <a href="Atlantic%20Wall">Atlantic Wall</a> fortifications had been built in 1940 and 1941, when the Germans had air superiority and could deter Allied air attacks. By 1942 this advantage had been lost to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>, which had begun deploying to England in May 1942, and a greatly expanded <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. The <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> preferred an alternative approach which would use trailer-style mobile launch platforms called "<a href="Meillerwagen">Meillerwagen</a>" accompanied by testing and fuelling equipment mounted on railway cars or trucks. Although this configuration was far less efficient and would have a much lower rate of fire, it would have the great advantage of presenting a much smaller target for the Allied air forces. The Army was not convinced that fixed bunkers could resist repeated air attacks and was particularly concerned about the vulnerability of the launch sites' road and rail links, which were essential for resupplying them with missiles and fuel.

In November 1942, Hitler and Minister of Munitions <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a> discussed possible launch configurations and examined models and plans of the proposed bunkers and mobile launchers. Hitler strongly preferred the bunker option, though he also gave the go-ahead for the production of mobile launchers. Two different bunker designs had been prepared: the B.III-2a design envisaged preparing the missile for launch inside the bunker, then transporting it outside to a launch pad, while the B.III-2b design would see the missile being elevated from within the bunker to a launch pad on the roof.

Speer gave orders that two bunkers were to be constructed by the <a href="Organisation%20Todt">Organisation Todt</a> construction group to a "special fortification standard" ("Sonderbaustärke"), requiring a steel-reinforced concrete ceiling thick and walls thick. They would be built near the coasts opposite England, one on the <a href="C%C3%B4te%20d%27Opale">Côte d'Opale</a> near <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> and the other on the <a href="Cotentin%20Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a> near <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>. Each would be capable of launching 36 missiles a day, would hold sufficient supplies of missiles and fuel to last three days, and would be manned by 250 troops.

In December 1942, Speer ordered Peenemünde officers and engineers (including Colonel Gerhard Stegmair, <a href="Ernst%20Steinhoff">Dr Ernst Steinhoff</a> and Lieutenant-Colonel Georg Thom) to tour the <a href="Artois">Artois</a> region in northwest France and locate a suitable site for an A-4 launch facility. The site chosen was just to the west of the small town of <a href="Watten%2C%20Nord">Watten</a>, in the <a href="Forest%20of%20%C3%89perlecques">Forest of Éperlecques</a>, near Saint-Omer in the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a>. It was given the cover name of "Kraftwerk Nord West" (Northwest Power Plant).

The location was conveniently close to the main railway line between Calais and Saint-Omer, the canalised <a href="Aa%20River%20%28France%29">River Aa</a>, main roads and electric grid lines. Situated from London, it was far enough inland to be safe from naval guns and it was sheltered to an extent by a ridge that rises to a height of to the north. At nearby Saint-Omer, there was a major <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> base which was capable of providing air defence for the area. There were existing gravel and sand quarries as well as cement works in the vicinity, which would help with the enormous amount of material that would be needed for the construction works. The quantities required were very substantial indeed; 200,000 tons of concrete and 20,000 tons of steel would be required to build the facility. When US Army Major General <a href="Lewis%20H.%20Brereton">Lewis H. Brereton</a> inspected the site after it had been captured by the Allies, he described the bunker as "more extensive than any concrete constructions we have in the United States, with the possible exception of <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Boulder Dam</a>."
The Watten bunker was to be built to a design based on the B.III-2a bunker, though substantially larger. The Germans had originally planned to build a separate LOX plant at <a href="Stenay">Stenay</a> but this option was abandoned in favour of installing a LOX production facility within the Watten bunker.

The bunker consisted of three main elements. The main part of the building was a giant structure some wide and high, housing the LOX plant and a vault where missiles would be assembled and prepared. Its walls were up to thick and the bunker's working levels descended below ground. The plant would house five Heylandt compressors, each capable of producing about 10 tons of LOX per day. About 150 tons of LOX were to be stored in insulated tanks on-site. The facility was intended to store up to 108 missiles and enough fuel to supply three days' worth of launches. The Germans planned to fire up to 36 rockets a day from the site.

On the north side of the building was a fortified standard gauge railway station, linked to the main Calais-Saint-Omer line at Watten via a spur line. Missiles, warheads and other components would be shipped to the station and transported on trucks into the main area of the bunker. Here the rockets were to be assembled, raised into a vertical position and fuelled and armed. From the arming halls, they would be moved to either end of the building through pivoting doors high. They would exit through the south face of the building and would be moved on tracks to the launch pads. There were no doors on the exit portals so <a href="chicane">chicane</a>s were installed in the exit passage to deflect the blast of rockets being launched from outside. Launches would be overseen from a command tower located in the centre of the south side of the bunker, overlooking the launch pads.

To the north of the bunker, the Germans erected a bomb-proof power station with a generating capacity. The site was initially powered from the main electricity grid, but it was intended that it would have its own independent power source to minimise the likelihood of disruption. Also associated with the Watten complex was a radar tracking site at <a href="Pr%C3%A9defin">Prédefin</a>, south of Saint-Omer. A <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg%20radar">Giant Würzburg radar</a> system was installed there to follow the trajectories of V-2s being launched from Watten. The intention was to follow the trajectory for as long as possible so that the accuracy of the missile launches could be determined.

The site was designed in January and February 1943 by engineers from the Peenemünde research facility and the Organisation Todt. On 25 March 1943 the construction plans were presented to Hitler, who immediately gave the go-ahead for the project to begin. The construction firm Holzman & Polanski was awarded the contract and 6,000 workers from Building Battalion 434 started construction that same month using plans by <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20Dorsch">Franz Xaver Dorsch</a>, Construction Director at the Organisation Todt. It was envisaged that the structure would be ready by the end of July 1943, though not its wiring and plant, and it was intended that it would be fully operational by 1 November 1943.

The workforce consisted of a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the "<a href="Service%20du%20Travail%20Obligatoire">Service du Travail Obligatoire</a>" (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after <a href="General%20Franco">General Franco</a>'s victory in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten "Zwangsarbeitslager" 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about distant from the site, near the village of Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained that it would have been easier to "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.
The labourers worked in 12-hour shifts of 3,000–4,000 men, with three 20-minute breaks during each shift. The work continued around the clock, seven days a week, under giant floodlights during the night. The living and working conditions were extremely harsh, especially for the political prisoners and the eastern Europeans, who were given especially punitive treatment due to their status as the most expendable members of the workforce. For the non-German workers, falling ill or being unable to work through injury was the equivalent of a death sentence, as they would either be left to die or be transported back to the concentration camps from which they had been brought. A German commission that inspected the labour camps in the area in late 1943 commented: "The Eastern [European] worker is very tough. He works at his job until he falls flat on his face in the mire, and all that is left for the doctor to do is to issue the death certificate."

A large supply dump was established at Watten next to the River Aa. This site was eventually used to store material required for all the V-weapon sites in the Saint-Omer area. Building materials were brought there by barges and trains where they were unloaded onto a <a href="Decauville">Decauville</a> narrow-gauge railway for transportation to the construction site, where concrete mixers operated day and night. A 90 kV power line running to a transformer at <a href="Holque">Holque</a> north of Watten provided electricity. An old quarry at <a href="Wizernes">Wizernes</a> codenamed "" (Gravel Quarry Northwest), some south of Watten, was also converted into a storage dump to supply the Watten facility.

In early April 1943, an Allied agent reported "enormous trenches" being excavated at the Watten site, and on 16 May 1943 an RAF reconnaissance mission led to Allied photographic interpreters noticing unidentified activity there. Other large facilities were observed to be under construction elsewhere in the Pas-de-Calais. The purpose of the construction works was very unclear; <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Lord Cherwell</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s scientific adviser, admitted that he had little idea what "these very large structures similar to gun emplacements" were but he believed that "if it is worth the enemy's while to go to all the trouble of building them it would seem worth ours to destroy them".

At the end of May, the British <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff</a> ordered that aerial attacks be carried out against the so-called "heavy sites" being built by the Germans. On 6 August, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, who headed a high-level Cabinet committee to coordinate the British defence against the German V-weapons, recommended that the Watten site should also be attacked because of the progress being made in its construction. The British Chiefs of Staff noted that a daylight attack by US bombers was under consideration but they raised objections to the proposal, as the Air Staff thought that Watten had nothing to do with rockets, suggesting that instead it might be merely a "protected operations room".

The timing of the first raid was influenced by advice given by Sir Malcolm McAlpine, the chairman of the construction company <a href="Sir%20Robert%20McAlpine">Sir Robert McAlpine</a>, who suggested that the Watten site should be attacked while the concrete was still setting. On 27 August 1943, 187 <a href="B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es of the US <a href="8th%20Air%20Force">8th Air Force</a> attacked the site with devastating effect. The fortified train station on the north side of the bunker was especially badly damaged, as concrete had just been poured there. Dornberger later wrote that following the attack the site was "a desolate heap of concrete, steel, props and planking. The concrete hardened. After a few days the shelter was beyond saving. All we could do was roof in a part and use it for other work." The bombing killed and injured hundreds of the slave workers on site; although the Allies had sought to avoid casualties by timing the raid with what they thought was a change of shifts, the shift pattern had been changed by the Germans at the last minute to achieve the day's work quota.
Only 35% of the Watten bunker had been completed by this time. It was clearly no longer possible to use it as a launch site, but the Germans still needed LOX production facilities to supply V-2 sites elsewhere. After surveying the site in September and October 1943, Organisation Todt engineers determined that the northern part of the facility was irretrievably damaged but decided to focus on completing the southern part to serve as a LOX factory. One of the OT's engineers, Werner Flos, came up with an idea to protect the bunker from bombardment by building it up from the roof first. This was done by initially constructing a concrete plate, flat on the ground, which was thick and weighed 37,000 tons. It was incrementally raised by <a href="jack%20%28mechanical%29">hydraulic jacks</a> and then supported by walls which were built underneath it as it was raised, becoming the roof. The resulting concrete cavern was intended to be used by the Germans as a bombproof liquid oxygen factory. The thickness of the roof was chosen on the assumption that Allied bombs were incapable of penetrating such a depth of concrete; the Germans, however, were unaware of the British development of <a href="earthquake%20bomb">earthquake bomb</a>s.

The Germans' main focus of attention switched instead to "Schotterwerk Nordwest", the former quarry at nearby Wizernes, where work had been ongoing to build a bombproof V-2 storage facility. This project was expanded to turn the quarry into a fixed launch facility. Plans were put into effect to build a huge concrete dome – now open to the public as the museum of <a href="La%20Coupole">La Coupole</a> – under which missiles would be fuelled and armed in a network of tunnels before being transported outside for launching. The Allies carried out further heavy bombing against both the Watten and Wizernes sites with little initial effect on the buildings themselves, although the rail and road network around them was systematically destroyed. On 3 July 1944, <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando West</a> gave permission to stop construction at both sites, which had been so disrupted by bombing that work could no longer proceed. Three days later an Allied raid succeeded in wrecking the interior of the Watten bunker with a <a href="Tallboy%20bomb">Tallboy bomb</a> that brought down part of the roof. Finally, on 18 July 1944, Hitler decreed that plans for launching missiles from bunkers need no longer be pursued. Dornberger's staff subsequently decided to continue minor construction at Watten "for deception purposes". The site itself was now useless, as the Germans recognised when they wryly codenamed it "Concrete Lump", and the liquid oxygen generators and machinery were transferred to the <a href="Mittelwerk">Mittelwerk</a> V-2 factory in central Germany, well away from Allied bombers.

The Watten site was captured on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated it a few days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.

The bunker was inspected on 10 September 1944 by the French atomic scientist <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a>, accompanied by Sandys. Following the visit, Sandys ordered a Technical Inter-Services Mission under Colonel <a href="Terence%20Sanders">T.R.B. Sanders</a> to investigate the sites at <a href="Fortress%20of%20Mimoyecques">Mimoyecques</a>, <a href="Siracourt%20V-1%20bunker">Siracourt</a>, Watten, and Wizernes, collectively known to the Allies as the "Heavy Crossbow" sites. Sanders' report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945.

Despite the capture of Watten, it was still not known at this time what the site had been intended for. Sanders noted that "the purpose of the structures was never known throughout the period of intensive reconnaissance and attack". Based on the discovery of large aluminium tanks installed in the main part of the bunker, he opined that the Germans had intended to use it as a factory for the production of <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> for use in the fuelling of V-1 and V-2 missiles. He ruled out the possibility that it could have been used for LOX production and concluded, erroneously, that "the site had no offensive role." He recommended that (unlike the Mimoyecques and Wizernes sites) the Watten bunker presented no threat to the UK's security and "there is thus no imperative need, on that account, to ensure the destruction of the workings."
The bunker was targeted again by the Allies in February 1945, this time to test the newly developed CP/RA <a href="Disney%20bomb">Disney bomb</a> – a concrete-piercing rocket-assisted bomb designed to double the normal impact velocity, and thereby increase the penetration, of the projectile. The site had been chosen for testing purposes in October 1944 as it had the largest accessible interior area of the targets under consideration and was furthest from an inhabited town. On 3 February 1945, a B-17 of the US Eighth Air Force dropped a Disney bomb on the Watten bunker and scored a hit over the wall section, but the results were inconclusive and the Air Force was not able to determine how well the bomb had penetrated the concrete. Although Disney bombs were used operationally on a number of occasions, the weapon's introduction came too late to be of any significance in the war effort. In January 2009 the body of the Disney bomb was extracted from the roof, where it had embedded itself.

The Watten bunker was inspected again on 20 June 1951 by an Anglo-French commission to determine whether it was capable of being reused for military purposes. The British Assistant Military Attaché, Major W.C. Morgan, reported to the <a href="Directorate%20of%20Military%20Intelligence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Director of Military Intelligence</a> at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> that the main part of the bunker had not been significantly damaged by bombing and that although it was flooded, if it was patched and drained "the building could be quickly made ready to receive oxygen liquifying plant machinery, or for any other purpose requiring a large and practically bomb-proof building."

No further military use was made of the bunker and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the bunker was opened to the public for the first time under the name of "Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques". The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a "<a href="monument%20historique">monument historique</a>". The area around the bunker has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a <a href="V-1%20%28flying%20bomb%29">V-1</a> on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the bunker with interpretative signs posted at various points to tell the story of the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.

Silverplate

Silverplate was the code reference for the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' participation in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Originally the name for the aircraft modification project which enabled a <a href="B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a> to drop an atomic weapon, "Silverplate" eventually came to identify the training and operational aspects of the program as well. The original directive for the project had as its subject line "Silver Plated Project" but continued usage of the term shortened it to "Silverplate".

Testing began with scale models at the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Naval Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Dahlgren%2C%20Virginia">Dahlgren, Virginia</a>, in August 1943. Modifications began on a prototype Silverplate B-29 known as the "Pullman" in November 1943, and it was used for bomb flight testing at <a href="Muroc%20Army%20Air%20Field">Muroc Army Air Field</a> in <a href="California">California</a> commencing in March 1944. The testing resulted in further modifications to both the bombs and the aircraft.

Seventeen production Silverplate aircraft were ordered in August 1944 to allow the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> to train with the type of aircraft they would have to fly in combat, and for the <a href="216th%20Army%20Air%20Forces%20Base%20Unit">216th Army Air Forces Base Unit</a> to test bomb configurations. These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between the end of the war and the end of 1947. Thus, 65 Silverplate B-29s were made.

The use of the Silverplate codename was discontinued after the war, but modifications continued under a new codename, Saddletree. Another 80 aircraft were modified under this program. The last group of B-29s was modified in 1953, but never saw further service.

The Silverplate project was initiated in June 1943 when Dr. <a href="Norman%20F.%20Ramsey">Norman F. Ramsey</a> from the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>'s E-7 Group identified the <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> as the only airplane in the United States inventory capable of carrying either type of the proposed weapons shapes: the tubular shape of the <a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a>, or the oval shape of the <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>.

Prior to the decision to use the B-29, serious consideration was given to using the British <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> with its cavernous bomb bay to deliver the weapon. It would have required much less modification, but would have required additional crew training for the USAAF crews. <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves Jr.</a>, the director of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, and <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, the Chief of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF), wished to use an American plane, if this was at all possible.

The first B-29 was delivered to the USAAF on 1 July 1943, and Groves met with Arnold later that month. Groves briefed Arnold on the Manhattan Project, and asked for his help in testing the <a href="ballistics">ballistics</a> of the Project's proposed bomb shapes. Arnold and the head of the Ordnance Division at Los Alamos, <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Parsons">William S. Parsons</a>, arranged for tests to be carried out at the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Naval Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Dahlgren%2C%20Virginia">Dahlgren, Virginia</a>, in August 1943. No aircraft was available that could carry the long Thin Man, so a scale model was used. The results were disappointing – the bomb fell in a flat spin – but the need for a thorough test program was demonstrated.

Groves met with Arnold again in September 1943. He informed Arnold that there was now a second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General <a href="Oliver%20P.%20Echols">Oliver P. Echols</a>. In turn, Echols designated <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Roscoe%20C.%20Wilson">Roscoe C. Wilson</a> as the Project Officer.
Originally the name for the aircraft modification project for the B-29 to enable it to drop a <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>, Silverplate eventually came to identify the training and operational aspects of the program as well. The airplane modification project fell under the purview of the Manhattan Project's <a href="Project%20Alberta">Project Alberta</a> after March 1945. The original codename for the project was "Silver Plated" but continued usage of the term shortened it to the one word "Silverplate". For security reasons, the codename "Silverplate" was not officially registered. Confusion then resulted when the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> allocated "Silverplate" to another project. Arnold's office had to order the other agency to discontinue its use of the codename.

Los Alamos's Thin Man and Fat Man code names were adopted by the USAAF for the weapons. A cover story was devised that Silverplate was about modifying a <a href="Pullman%20car">Pullman car</a> for use by President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> (Thin Man) and United Kingdom Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> (Fat Man) on a secret tour of the United States.

The USAAF sent instructions to its <a href="Air%20Materiel%20Command">Army Air Forces Materiel Command</a> at <a href="Wright%20Field">Wright Field</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, on 30 November 1943, for a highly classified B-29 modification project. The Manhattan Project would deliver full-sized mockups of the weapons shapes to Wright Field by mid-December, where Army Air Forces Materiel Command would modify an aircraft and deliver it for use in bomb flight testing at <a href="Muroc%20Army%20Air%20Field">Muroc Army Air Field</a> in <a href="California">California</a>. B-29-5-BW 42-6259 (referred to as the "Pullman airplane" from an internal code name assigned it by the Engineering Division of Army Air Forces Materiel Command) was delivered to the <a href="468th%20Bombardment%20Group">468th Bombardment Group</a> at <a href="Smoky%20Hill%20AAB">Smoky Hill AAB</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, on 30 November 1943, and flown to Wright Field on 2 December.

Modifications to the bomb bays of 42-6259 were extensive and time-consuming. Its four bomb bay doors and the fuselage section between the bays were removed and a single bomb bay configured. The length of the initial gun-type bomb shape was approximately , necessitating that it be carried in the aft bomb bay, with some of its length protruding into the forward bay. The implosion-type bomb was mounted in the forward bay. New bomb suspensions and bracing were attached for both shape types, and separate twin-release mechanisms were mounted in each bay, using modified glider tow-cable attach-and-release mechanisms.

The Pullman B-29 flew into Muroc on 20 February 1944, and testing began on 28 February. Twenty-four drops were carried out before tests were discontinued so that improvements could be made to Thin Man. The bombs failed to release immediately, frustrating <a href="calibration">calibration</a> tests. In what turned out to be the last test flight of the series on 16 March, a Thin Man was prematurely released while the B-29 was still en route to the test range and fell onto the bomb bay doors, severely damaging the aircraft. The modified glider mechanisms had apparently caused all four malfunctions, because of the weight of the bombs, and were replaced with British Type G single-point attachments and Type F releases used on the <a href="Avro%20Lancaster%23Variants">Lancaster B.I Special</a> to carry the <a href="Tallboy%20bomb">Tallboy bomb</a>.

After repair of the Pullman B-29 at Wright Field, testing resumed with three Thin Man and nine Fat Man shapes dropped in the last two weeks of June 1944. High speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a "California Parachute", a cubical tail box with eight fins within the sheetmetal box "frame", 45° apart from each other (four "<a href="Orthogonality">orthogonal</a>" fins, and four more, one at each 45º angle to each corner) to the line of fall was approved.

The Thin Man gun-type design was at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> isotope so far only produced in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford</a> production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a> obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.

Thin Man as a plutonium-based design was therefore abandoned and the weapon was re-designed to use <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>. The muzzle velocity required was much lower, reducing the barrel length of the resulting bomb, now code-named <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>, to less than . This allowed the device to fit into a standard B-29 bomb bay, so the Pullman was modified to its original configuration with the rear bomb bay of a standard B-29 design. All subsequent Silverplates were also configured in this manner. The Pullman B-29 was flown to <a href="Wendover%20Army%20Air%20Field">Wendover Army Air Field</a> in <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in September 1944. It carried out further drop testing with the <a href="216th%20Army%20Air%20Forces%20Base%20Unit">216th Army Air Forces Base Unit</a> until it was damaged in a landing accident in December.

On 22 August 1944, to meet the requirements of the USAAF group about to be formed to train in the atomic mission, a production phase of Silverplate B-29s was ordered from the <a href="Glenn%20L.%20Martin%20Company">Glenn L. Martin Company</a>'s modification center at <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, under the designation Project 98146-S. The first three of these second increment Silverplate B-29s were delivered to the USAAF in mid-October, and flown to Wendover. They were fitted with British single-point bomb releases mounted on a re-designed H-frame suspension rack fitted in the forward bomb bay, so that additional fuel tanks could be carried in the aft bay. A new crew position, called the "weaponeer station", was created in the cockpit with a panel to monitor the release and detonation of the bomb during the actual combat drops. Fourteen production aircraft were assigned to the <a href="393d%20Bombardment%20Squadron">393d Bombardment Squadron</a> for training, and three to the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit for bomb drop testing.

By February 1945 the seventeen aircraft of the second increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a>) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, a decision was made to start a new production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">two atomic bomb missions</a> in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a>. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.
The final wartime Silverplates incorporated all technical improvements to B-29 aircraft, as well as the final series of Silverplate modifications that included Curtiss Electric <a href="Reverse%20thrust">reversible-pitch</a> <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s, and pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors. The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms. Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early Silverplate bombers were no exception. One was written off after being badly damaged as a result of an engine fire in February 1945. The <a href="Fuel%20injection">fuel-injected</a> <a href="Wright%20R-3350-41">Wright R-3350-41</a> engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable. This was an important factor in the success of the 509th Composite Group's operations.

The Fat Man and <a href="Pumpkin%20bomb">Pumpkin bomb</a>s (non-nuclear bombs that resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, even with the more powerful engines. Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all <a href="Turret%23Aircraft">gun turret</a>s and <a href="armor%20plating">armor plating</a>. This work was done by the 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.

Flying at put the B-29s above the effective range of Japanese <a href="flak">flak</a>. Each Pumpkin bomb mission was conducted by a formation of three aircraft in the hope of convincing the Japanese military that small groups of B-29s did not justify a strong response. This strategy proved successful, and Japanese fighters only occasionally attempted to intercept the 509th Composite Group's aircraft. One B-29 incurred minor battle damage in operations.

Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during World War II. Of these, 29 were assigned to the 509th Composite Group during World War II, with 15 used to carry out the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between the end of the war, and the end of 1947. By this time only 13 of the original 46 were still operational. Thus, a total of 65 Silverplate B-29s were made, of which 32 were operational at the start of 1948. Martin-Omaha produced 57 Silverplate B-29s. The other 8 were built by Boeing-Wichita. Of these 65 bombers, 31 were eventually converted to other configurations, 16 were placed in storage and later scrapped, and 12 were lost in accidents (including four of the Tinian bombers). The pair of historic weapons delivery aircraft, named "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>" and "<a href="Bockscar">Bockscar</a>", are today displayed in museums.

The only other <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> combat unit to use the Silverplate B-29 was the <a href="97th%20Bombardment%20Wing">97th Bombardment Wing</a> at <a href="Biggs%20Air%20Force%20Base">Biggs Air Force Base</a> in <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>. In mid-1949 it received 27 of the aircraft from the <a href="509th%20Bombardment%20Wing">509th Bombardment Wing</a> when the latter transitioned to <a href="B-50%20Superfortress">B-50D</a> bombers. The re-equipment of the 97th Bombardment Wing was part of an expansion of the atomic strike force to ten wings during 1949. Within a year all were converted to TB-29 trainers. One other Silverplate B-29, on temporary assignment in the United Kingdom, was converted into a weather reconnaissance aircraft (WB-29) and transferred to the <a href="9th%20Reconnaissance%20Wing">9th Bombardment Wing</a> at <a href="Travis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Travis Air Force Base</a> in California. The last Silverplate B-29 in service as a nuclear weapons carrier was reassigned to another role in November 1951, ending Silverplate after nearly eight years.

Use of the codename Silverplate was discontinued in May 1947. It was superseded by a new codename, "Saddletree", which was applied to aircraft modifications only. Initially it was intended that Saddletree would refer only to modifications to the B-29s, but it came to be used for modifications to B-50 and <a href="B-36">B-36</a> bombers as well. Saddletree modifications included a new bomb bay frame and hoist, and replacing the British FG bomb release with the newly developed U-1 pneumatic bomb release mechanism. Due to delays in the delivery of the B-50s, Saddletree commenced in February 1948. In all, 6,000 hours of work was carried out on each of the 36 B-50s by Sacramento Air Materiel Area.

The <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> issued a directive in January 1948 for the modification of 225 B-29, B-50, and B-36 bombers to carry nuclear weapons, along with eight <a href="C-97%20Stratofreighter">C-97 Stratofreighter</a> aircraft to carry bomb assembly teams. There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a>, so the Air Materiel Command was directed to carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could not carry nuclear weapons without major modifications.

As the anticipated enemy was the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the aircraft also required "winterization" to allow them to operate from <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> bases. The project included 36 B-29s, and the modification of 36 others to have an <a href="air%20refueling">air refueling</a> capability. With the addition of the 80 Saddletree B-29s, a total of 145 B-29s were modified to carry nuclear weapons, and 117 of these were assigned to operational units.

In October 1951, in anticipation of a major build-up of the USAF to 95 groups, and of delays in the <a href="B-47">B-47</a> program, the Air Materiel Command was ordered to modify a further 180 B-29s then in storage to carry the <a href="Mark%204%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 4</a>, <a href="Mark%205%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 5</a>, <a href="Mark%206%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 6</a>, and <a href="Mark%208%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 8 nuclear bomb</a>s. Modifications were carried out in Oklahoma City and Sacramento. By the time the aircraft were all delivered in September 1953, the B-29 was being phased out, and the modified aircraft went back into storage without seeing further service.

In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 to upgrade an aircraft to Silverplate configuration, so the total cost of a Silverplate bomber was $814,000. The total cost of the 65 wartime Silverplate B-29s was therefore $53 million. Adding $7 million for logistics, this put the estimated cost of the Silverplate project at around $60 million.

No Me Queda Más

"No Me Queda Más" ("There's Nothing Left for Me") is a song by American singer <a href="Selena">Selena</a> on her fourth studio album, "<a href="Amor%20Prohibido">Amor Prohibido</a>". It was released as the third <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> from the album in October 1994 by <a href="EMI%20Latin">EMI Latin</a>. "No Me Queda Más" was written by <a href="Ricky%20Vela">Ricky Vela</a>, and production was handled by Selena's brother <a href="A.B.%20Quintanilla">A.B. Quintanilla</a>. A <a href="tempo">downtempo</a> <a href="mariachi">mariachi</a> and <a href="pop%20ballad">pop ballad</a>, "No Me Queda Más" portrays the <a href="ranchera">ranchera</a> storyline of a woman in agony after the end of a relationship. Its lyrics express an <a href="unrequited%20love">unrequited love</a>, the singer wishing the best for her former lover and his new partner.

Praised by <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a> for its emotive nature, "No Me Queda Más" was one of the most successful singles of Selena's career. It topped the United States <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">Hot Latin Songs</a> chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, her third successive number-one song. It was Selena's first number-one track on the US <a href="Regional%20Mexican%20Airplay">Regional Mexican Airplay</a> chart, and became <a href="Billboard%20Top%20Latin%20Songs%20Year-End%20Chart">the most successful US Latin single of 1995</a>. It has been ranked the ninth-best <a href="Tejano%20music">Tejano</a> recording by "Billboard" magazine and the eleventh-best Hot Latin Songs chart single in 2011.

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "No Me Queda Más" was shot in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>'s <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> station. It received the Music Video of the Year award at the <a href="Billboard%20Latin%20Music%20Awards">"Billboard" Latin Music Awards</a>, and the recording received two <a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">Broadcast Music</a> honors including Song of the Year. Many musicians have since recorded <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s, including Mexican singer <a href="Pepe%20Aguilar">Pepe Aguilar</a>, American salsa singer <a href="Tito%20Nieves">Tito Nieves</a>, and Mexican pop group Palomo. The Palomo version peaked at number six on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart, while Nieves' version reached number seven on the US <a href="Tropical%20Songs">Tropical Songs</a> chart.

In 1985, <a href="Ricky%20Vela">Ricky Vela</a> joined <a href="Selena%20y%20Los%20Dinos">Selena y Los Dinos</a> as their <a href="keyboardist">keyboardist</a>. Although Vela was attracted to the group's drummer, <a href="Suzette%20Quintanilla">Suzette Quintanilla</a>, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager <a href="Abraham%20Quintanilla%2C%20III">Abraham Quintanilla, III</a>, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote "No Me Queda Más" and it was given to Selena to record for "<a href="Amor%20Prohibido">Amor Prohibido</a>". Selena's brother <a href="A.B.%20Quintanilla">A.B. Quintanilla</a> did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a <a href="mariachi">mariachi</a> track, EMI Latin president <a href="Jose%20Behar">Jose Behar</a> believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the <a href="popular%20music">popular market</a>. The group gave it to Argentine arranger <a href="Bebu%20Silvetti">Bebu Silvetti</a> to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to "sweeten" the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> interview that the song was "internalized" without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, "What you got there is what you got" and left to go shopping. He mused, "Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic."

"No Me Queda Más" is a <a href="tempo">downtempo</a> <a href="mariachi">mariachi</a> and <a href="pop%20ballad">pop ballad</a>, incorporating <a href="ranchera">ranchera</a> and <a href="flamenco%20music">flamenco</a> influences into its sound. Musicologists <a href="Ilan%20Stavans">Ilan Stavans</a> and <a href="Harold%20Augenbraum">Harold Augenbraum</a> called the song a <a href="bolero">bolero</a>-mariachi mix. This was echoed by the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>", which noted its bolero influences. "<a href="Texas%20Monthly">Texas Monthly</a>" editor Joe Nick Patoski wrote that Vela "riffed off romantic boleros" and the song "showcase[d] Selena's <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> and control". "No Me Queda Más" has a "traditional [mariachi] <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a> duet harmony", using <a href="violin">violin</a>s and <a href="guitar">guitar</a>s in a lush <a href="string%20%28music%29">string</a> arrangement.

The song employs the traditional ranchera storyline, with the female singer agonizing over the end of a relationship. Its lyrics explore unrequited love; when the singer's lover leaves her for another woman, she nevertheless wishes them "nothing but happiness." According to author Lori Beth Rodriguez, Selena sings the song "in a low, sober voice", and critic <a href="Howard%20Blumenthal">Howard Blumenthal</a> adds that she does so in a "desperate" and "sentimental" way. Ramiro Burr of the "<a href="San%20Antonio%20Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a>" called her <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> vocals "powerful" and "emotive"; other critics have described "No Me Queda Más" as "torchy", "mournful", "piercing" and "heartbreaking".

"No Me Queda Más" was well-received, reviewers describing it as "evocative", "romantic", and "bittersweet"; A.B.'s use of "<a href="world%20music">world-music</a> flourishes" on the song was noted approvingly by Michael Clark. Writing in "<a href="The%20Billboard%20Guide%20to%20Tejano%20and%20Regional%20Mexican%20Music">The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music</a>", Ramiro Burr felt that the lyrics, about "finding the strength to walk away", evoked "the pain of love and the tone of redemption". The song became an "instant classic", according to Roger Burns, writing in "Icons of Latino America". Other reviewers agreed that it was one of the most successful singles from "Amor Prohibido", with Lisa Leal of <a href="KVTV">KVTV</a> commenting that the song is a Spanish-language counterpart of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' 1965 single "<a href="Yesterday%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Yesterday</a>" in fan popularity.

The track received several awards and accolades. It was the Song of the Year at the 1995 <a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">Broadcast Music Awards</a>, and Vela received the Songwriter of the Year award in 1996. Its video was honored as the Music Video of the Year at the 1995 <a href="Billboard%20Latin%20Music%20Awards">"Billboard" Latin Music Awards</a>. "No Me Queda Más" was ranked as the ninth-best Tejano song of all time on Ramiro Burr's top-ten list. It has appeared on several critics' "best Selena songs" lists, including <a href="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</a> (at number one), "Latino Post" (number four), and "<a href="Latina%20%28magazine%29">Latina</a>" (number five).

"Billboard" announced that a new airplay-measuring system for its music charts would be based on <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a>s beginning on November 12, 1994. "No Me Queda Más" entered the US <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">Hot Latin Songs</a> chart at number 40 on that date, and Selena's "<a href="Bidi%20Bidi%20Bom%20Bom">Bidi Bidi Bom Bom</a>" remained at number one. On November 19, the song rose to number ten on that chart and subsequently debuted on the US <a href="Regional%20Mexican%20Airplay">Regional Mexican Airplay</a> chart at number seven. The following week, it climbed to the fifth and fourth positions on the Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Airplay charts, respectively. "Billboard" contributor John Lannert, noting that three different songs had topped the Hot Latin Songs chart since the inception of the Nielsen-rating system, predicted that <a href="Luis%20Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>'s number one single "La Media Vuelta" could be unseated by "No Me Queda Más". The following week, "La Media Vuelta" remained atop the chart and "No Me Queda Más" rose to number two. "No Me Queda Más" topped the Regional Mexican Airplay chart for three consecutive weeks beginning on December 3, Selena's first number one on that chart. The song peaked at number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart on December 17, her third consecutive number one. It debuted at number 13 on the US <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Songs">Latin Pop Songs</a> chart on January 7, 1995, remaining atop the Hot Latin Songs chart. The song reclaimed the number-one spot on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart for January 14, unseating <a href="La%20Mafia">La Mafia</a>'s "Me Duele Estar Solo". La Mafia displaced "No Me Queda Más" from the top of the Regional Mexican Airplay and Hot Latin Songs charts on January 21, ending the song's five-week reign on the latter. The following week, "No Me Queda Más" regained the top of both charts. On February 4, it fell to number two on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart and retained the top spot on the Hot Latin Songs chart for its seventh nonconsecutive week. It was displaced from the top of the Hot Latin Songs chart on February 11 by <a href="Grupo%20Bronco">Grupo Bronco</a>'s "Que No Me Olvide". It was the most popular song from "Amor Prohibido" on Mexican radio.

Selena was <a href="murder%20of%20Selena">shot and killed</a> on March 31, 1995 by <a href="Yolanda%20Sald%C3%ADvar">Yolanda Saldívar</a>, a friend who was the former manager of the singer's <a href="Selena%20Etc.">Selena Etc.</a> boutiques. Four of her singles—"No Me Queda Más", "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", "<a href="Como%20la%20Flor">Como la Flor</a>" and "<a href="Amor%20Prohibido%20%28song%29">Amor Prohibido</a>"—reentered the "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Airplay charts on April 15. "No Me Queda Más" placed fifth and eighth on the Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Airplay charts, respectively, and remained in the top ten of the Hot Latin Songs chart for 12 consecutive weeks. "Billboard" posthumously named Selena the Top Latin Artist of the 1990s in recognition of her fourteen top-ten singles on the Hot Latin Songs chart, including seven number ones. "No Me Queda Más" was the <a href="Billboard%20Top%20Latin%20Songs%20Year-End%20Chart">most successful US Latin single of 1995</a>. It ranked eleventh on "Billboard"s quarter-century celebration of the Hot Latin Songs chart in 2011. "Billboard" began monitoring <a href="music%20download">digital downloads</a> of Latin songs during the week ending January 23, 2010. "No Me Queda Más" made its debut at number 23 on the <a href="Latin%20Digital%20Songs">Latin Digital Songs</a> chart following the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death. On the <a href="Billboard%20charts%23Latin">Latin Pop Digital Songs</a> chart, the song debuted at number 22 and peaked at number nine.

An accompanying music video for "No Me Queda Más" was filmed in October 1994 at the <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> <a href="San%20Antonio%20station%20%28Texas%29">Amtrak station</a>. Produced by Summit Productions, the video was directed by Sean Roberts. Shooting took four days to complete. Jack Morgan was the on-set photographer, and Diego Aguilar produced the video. Selena wore the same dress that she did when she won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Mexican/Mexican-American%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album</a> in <a href="36th%20Grammy%20Awards">1994</a>. Veronica Flores, a reporter for the "San Antonio Express-News", was asked to make a cameo appearance as a wedding guest. American model Freddie Martinez portrayed Selena's love interest after auditioning for the role in San Antonio.

The video's location was later used for Selena's fashion-show scene in "<a href="Selena%20%28film%29">Selena</a>" (1997), starring <a href="Jennifer%20Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a>. <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> used "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" as part of her <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">2016 presidential campaign</a> in San Antonio (which received a mixed response from Hispanics), playing the song at the location where Selena recorded the music video for "No Me Queda Más". <a href="Univision">Univision</a> ranked the music video at number four on their top ten favorite music videos of Selena.

In the video, Selena is sitting in a restaurant where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her a glass of water. As the singer enjoys her dinner, the waiter returns with a note saying that her lover (for whom she has been waiting) has left her for another woman. Selena takes a sip of water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.

The singer is in the dark behind a busy highway, sobbing and peeling petals off a white rose in a game of <a href="He%20loves%20me...%20he%20loves%20me%20not">He loves me... he loves me not</a> as a <a href="Montage%20%28filmmaking%29">montage</a> is playing of images of Selena and her former lover. Selena then sings on a staircase in a white dress, accompanied by an orchestra. She considers crashing her ex-lover's beach wedding, but instead runs away in tears. Selena's ex-lover and his new wife kiss, and a video plays in which he kisses Selena's hands. He then embraces his wife as Selena looks down, sobbing.

American <a href="salsa%20music">salsa</a> singer <a href="Tito%20Nieves">Tito Nieves</a> recorded "No Me Queda Más" for his third studio album, "Un Tipo Comun" (1996). The song was commercially more successful than the four singles released from the album, where it peaked at number seven on the US <a href="Tropical%20Songs">Tropical Songs</a> chart. That same year, Dominican singer <a href="Kat%20DeLuna">Kat DeLuna</a> won first place when she sang the song at the New Jersey Hispanic Youth Showcase, a children's singing competition. In 1998, <a href="Los%20Tres%20Reyes">Los Tres Reyes</a> (a mariachi group produced by Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.) recorded a duet version of the song. <a href="Graciela%20Beltran">Graciela Beltran</a> covered the song during a memorial for Selena in <a href="Houston">Houston</a> in 2003. Mexican singer <a href="Pepe%20Aguilar">Pepe Aguilar</a> performed and recorded "No Me Queda Más" for a live, televised tribute concert, "<a href="Selena%20%C2%A1VIVE%21">Selena ¡VIVE!</a>", in April 2005. According to Michael Clark of the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>", "[Aguilar's] vocal ... was reminiscent of <a href="Aaron%20Neville">Aaron Neville</a>".

Mexican pop group Palomo recorded "No Me Queda Más" for their <a href="live%20album">live album</a>, "En Concierto-En Vivo Desde L.A." (2005). The song debuted at number 37 on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart on March 19, 2005, and at number 46 on the Hot Latin Songs chart on April 2. It remained on the chart until July 16, peaking at numbers 19 and six on the Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Airplay charts, respectively. Ricky Vela received a BMI Latin Music Award for the Palomo's cover in 2007. American singer <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Feliciano">José Feliciano</a> recorded it for his album, "Jose Feliciano y Amigos", in 2006; Ramiro Burr of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" called it a "bittersweet ranchera". Cuban singer Toñita recorded the song for her album, "Desafiando al Destino", in 2007. A year later, American singer Maria Williams recorded an English-language version entitled "Nothing Left For Me" for her debut album "Hybrid". American singer <a href="David%20Archuleta">David Archuleta</a> performed the song as a tribute to Selena at the <a href="2010%20Tejano%20Music%20Awards">2010 Tejano Music Awards</a>, and <a href="Karen%20Rodriguez">Karen Rodriguez</a> sang it during the <a href="American%20Idol%20%28season%2010%29">tenth season</a> of "<a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a>".

Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)

The invasion of Tulagi, on 3–4 May 1942, was part of <a href="Operation%20Mo">Operation "Mo"</a>, the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>'s strategy in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">South Pacific</a> and <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> in 1942. The plan called for <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> troops to capture <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a> and nearby islands in the <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands">British Solomon Islands Protectorate</a>. The occupation of Tulagi by the Japanese was intended to cover the <a href="flanking%20maneuver">flank</a> of and provide <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> support for Japanese forces that were advancing on <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, provide greater defensive depth for the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, and serve as a base for Japanese forces to threaten and interdict the supply and communication routes between the United States and Australia and New Zealand.

Without the means to effectively resist the Japanese offensive in the Solomons, the British <a href="Resident%20Commissioner">Resident Commissioner</a> of the Solomon Islands protectorate and the few Australian troops assigned to defend Tulagi evacuated the island just before the Japanese forces arrived on 3 May. The next day, however, a U.S. <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> <a href="task%20force">task force</a> en route to resist the Japanese forces advancing on Port Moresby (later taking part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>) struck the Japanese Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of the Japanese ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation. Nevertheless, the Japanese troops successfully occupied Tulagi and began the construction of a small naval base.

Over the next several months, the Japanese established a naval refueling, communications, and <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> reconnaissance base on Tulagi and the nearby <a href="islets">islets</a> of <a href="Gavutu">Gavutu</a> and <a href="Tanambogo">Tanambogo</a>, and in July 1942 began to build a large airfield on nearby <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>. The Japanese activities on Tulagi and Guadalcanal were observed by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a>, as well as by Australian <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatcher</a> personnel stationed in the area. Because these activities threatened the Allied supply and communication lines in the South Pacific, Allied forces counter-attacked with landings of their own on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, initiating the critical <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a> and a series of combined arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces that, along with the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>, decided the course of the war in the South Pacific.

On 7 December 1941, <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">the Japanese attacked</a> the U.S. Pacific fleet at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. The attack crippled most of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's battleships and started a formal <a href="Declaration%20of%20war">state of war</a> between the two nations. In launching this war, Japanese leaders sought to neutralize the American fleet, seize possessions rich in natural resources, and obtain strategic military bases to defend their far-flung empire. Soon after, other nations—including the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, Australia, and New Zealand—joined the U.S. as <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in the war against Japan. In the words of the Japanese Navy's <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> "Secret Order Number One", dated 1 November 1941, the goals of the initial Japanese campaigns in the impending war were to, "(eject) British and American strength from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines, (and) to establish a policy of autonomous self-sufficiency and economic independence." To support these goals, during the first few months of 1942 Japanese forces also attacked and took control of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, the <a href="Netherlands%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a>, <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>, and <a href="Guam">Guam</a>.

<a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Shigeyoshi%20Inoue">Shigeyoshi Inoue</a>—commander of the <a href="IJN%204th%20Fleet">Japanese 4th Fleet</a> (also called the "South Seas Force") consisting of most of the naval units in the South Pacific area—advocated the seizing of <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>, and <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. Inoue believed that the capture and control of these locations would provide greater security for the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. Japan's <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20General%20Staff">Naval General Staff</a> endorsed Inoue's argument and began planning further operations, using these locations as supporting bases, to seize <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a>, <a href="Banaba%20Island">Ocean Island</a>, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, and <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> and thereby cut the supply lines between Australia and the U.S., with the goal of reducing or eliminating Australia as a threat to Japanese positions in the South Pacific.

The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> supported the idea of taking Port Moresby and in April 1942, with the Japanese Navy, developed a plan for the attack that was titled "<a href="Operation%20Mo">Operation "Mo"</a>". The plan also included the seizure of Tulagi, a small island in the southern Solomon Islands, where a seaplane base would be set up for potential air operations against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific. Although Japanese Admiral <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>—commander of the Combined Fleet—was concurrently planning an operation that he hoped would lure the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet</a> into a decisive showdown in the central Pacific, he detached some of his large warships to support the "Mo" operation and placed Inoue in charge of the naval portion of the operation.
A large force consisting of two heavy <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, one light aircraft carrier, a seaplane carrier, nine <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, and 13 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s—split into several elements—was to guard the Japanese Port Moresby invasion convoy as well as to engage any Allied naval warships that approached to contest the invasion. The Tulagi invasion force, consisting of the destroyers and , minelayer/transports , and , auxiliary minesweepers "Wa #1", "Wa #2", and transports "Hagoromo Maru", "Noshiro Maru #2", "Tama Maru", and "Azumasan Maru", subchasers "Toshi Maru #3" and "Tama Maru #8" and commanded by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Kiyohide%20Shima">Kiyohide Shima</a> (flag on "Okinoshima"), departed from Rabaul on 30 April and headed towards the Solomon Islands. Rear Admiral <a href="Aritomo%20Got%C5%8D">Aritomo Gotō</a> provided air cover for the Tulagi invasion with his Covering Group of one light carrier (), four cruisers, and one destroyer located just west of the central Solomons. A separate Cover Force (sometimes referred to as the Tulagi Support Group)—commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Kuninori%20Marumo">Kuninori Marumo</a> and consisting of two light cruisers, the <a href="seaplane%20tender">seaplane tender</a> , and three gunboats—joined the Covering Group in supporting the Tulagi invasion. Once Tulagi was secured on 3 or 4 May, the Covering Group and Cover Force were to reposition to help cover the Port Moresby invasion.

At the time, Tulagi was the capital of the <a href="British%20Solomon%20Islands%20Protectorate">British Solomon Islands Protectorate</a>, which included all of the islands of the Solomons except <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> and <a href="Buka%20Island">Buka</a>. <a href="William%20Sydney%20Marchant">William Sydney Marchant</a>, the British <a href="resident%20commissioner">Resident Commissioner</a> of the Solomons and commander of the local defense forces, directed the evacuation of most of the white civilian residents to Australia in February 1942. Marchant was evacuated to <a href="Malaita%20Island">Malaita</a> the following month, where he helped operate a coastwatcher relay station.

The only Allied military forces at Tulagi were 24 <a href="commando">commando</a>s from the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>'s <a href="Australian%20commandos">2/1st Independent Company</a>, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAAF">11 Squadron</a> <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">RAAF</a>, under <a href="Flying%20Officer">F/O</a> R. B. Peagam, operating a seaplane base on nearby <a href="Gavutu">Gavutu</a>-Tanambogo with four <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a> maritime patrol aircraft. Three Allied <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatchers</a> were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The task of the coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that they observed in the vicinity of their stations. In the belief that it might prevent them being executed for <a href="espionage">espionage</a>, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve</a> officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander <a href="Eric%20Augustas%20Feldt">Eric Feldt</a>, who was located at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a> in Australia.
Throughout most of April, the Japanese conducted "desultory" bombing raids on Tulagi with aircraft based at Rabaul or nearby that caused little, if any, damage. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal were usually able to radio advance warning to the Australian troops on Tulagi of the approaching Japanese aircraft, but the troops did not have large enough weaponry—three <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a>s and one <a href="Bren%20light%20machine%20gun">Bren light machine gun</a>—to seriously challenge the Japanese bombers. On 25 April, Tulagi was bombed by eight Japanese aircraft. Similar raids occurred daily over the next week, with one raid on 1 May heavily damaging one of the Catalinas at Gavutu. The remaining Catalinas successfully evacuated that same day.

Allied <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> personnel had deciphered much of the Japanese "Mo" plans through <a href="Signals%20intelligence">radio intercepts</a> at the Allied <a href="Fleet%20Radio%20Unit">Fleet Radio Unit</a>s (radio intelligence centers) in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Based on this intelligence, on 22 April, U.S. Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>—stationed at Pearl Harbor—directed Allied forces towards the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> area to interdict the Japanese "Mo" operation. On 27 April, the U.S. <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> 's <a href="Task%20Force%2017">Task Force 17</a> (TF 17), under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Frank%20Jack%20Fletcher">Frank Jack Fletcher</a>, sortied from <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> and was joined by the U.S. carrier 's <a href="Task%20Force%2011">TF 11</a> northwest of <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> on 1 May. That same day, Fletcher detached TF 11 to refuel, expecting to rejoin with "Lexington" and her escorts on 4 May at a predetermined location in the Coral Sea.

On 2 May, coastwatcher Jack Read on Bougainville reported that a large force of Japanese ships, believed to be part of the Japanese Tulagi invasion force, had departed from the Buka area. Later that day, coastwatcher D. G. Kennedy on <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a> island sighted and reported a large Japanese force of ships heading towards the southern Solomons. Soon after, Goode and Peagam—anticipating that the Japanese would attack with overwhelming numbers—ordered the execution of a pre-planned evacuation operation and began the destruction and demolition of their equipment and facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. The RAAF personnel and commandos embarked on two small ships early in the morning on 3 May to begin the trip to Vila, New Hebrides, just as Shima's ships entered Savo sound to begin their landings on Tulagi. The ship with the RAAF personnel spent the day with coastwatcher and protectorate <a href="District%20Officer">District Officer</a> <a href="Martin%20Clemens">Martin Clemens</a> at Aola on Guadalcanal and departed that night.

Supporting the Japanese landings were seaplanes from "Kamikawa Maru", temporarily based at <a href="Thousand%20Ships%20Bay">Thousand Ships Bay</a> at <a href="Santa%20Isabel%20Island">Santa Isabel Island</a>. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure <a href="Japanese%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Forces">Special Naval Landing Force</a>—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from "Shōhō" covered the landings until early afternoon, when Gotō's force turned toward Bougainville to refuel in preparation to support the landings at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor as part of the establishment of the planned seaplane base there.

At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was notified that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been sighted the day before approaching the southern Solomons. Unable to communicate with the "Lexington" task force because of the need to maintain radio silence, "Yorktown"s task force proceeded independently toward Guadalcanal in order to be in position to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning.
At 07:01 on 4 May, "Yorktown" launched a first strike consisting of 12 <a href="Douglas%20TBD%20Devastator">TBD Devastator</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s and 28 <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">SBD Dauntless</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s from a position about south of Guadalcanal. The aircraft began their attacks on Shima's ships anchored near Tulagi at 08:50, taking the Japanese ships by surprise and at anchor. "Okinoshima" and the two destroyers were positioned to provide a protective barrier for "<a href="Azumasan%20Maru%20%281933%29">Azumasan Maru</a>" and "Kōei Maru" which were busy unloading troops and materiel. The three minesweepers had just got underway to support the Port Moresby invasion and were still near Tulagi. Although the U.S. pilots from the first strike claimed many bomb and torpedo hits on the anchored ships, they actually hit only "Okinoshima", causing minor damage, and "Kikuzuki", causing major damage. "Kikuzuki"—with the assistance of one of the subchasers—was beached on Gavutu in an attempt to keep her from sinking. During this time, all of the other ships weighed anchor and attempted to escape from the harbor. One U.S. dive bomber destroyed a Japanese <a href="Mitsubishi%20F1M">Mitsubishi F1M</a>2 "Pete" <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> that attempted to take off during the attack.
"Yorktown"s second strike—utilizing the same aircraft—returned to Tulagi and began their attack at 12:10 on the Japanese ships, many of which were now at full steam and attempting to put distance between themselves and Tulagi harbor. The second strike hit and sank the minesweepers "#1" and "#2" and severely damaged "Tama Maru" northeast of <a href="Savo%20Island">Savo Island</a>. Another Japanese seaplane was shot down by a U.S. dive bomber during the second strike. After four <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">F4F-3/3A Wildcat</a> fighters from "Yorktown" joined the strike, the fighters shot down two more Japanese <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s over <a href="Florida%20Island">Florida Island</a>. The four U.S. fighters then strafed "Yūzuki", killing her captain and nine others of her crew, and causing moderate damage to the ship. Two or three other Japanese floatplanes were damaged in Tulagi harbor and their crews were killed.

A third, smaller strike from "Yorktown" arrived at 15:30 and caused moderate damage to "Azumasan Maru" and "Okinoshima". One of the TBDs in the third strike became lost, ran out of fuel, and ditched in the ocean about south of Guadalcanal. Two of the Wildcats from the second strike also ran out of fuel and crash landed on the southern coast of Guadalcanal. Fletcher sent the destroyers USS "Hammann" and "Perkins" to rescue the aircrews from the three aircraft. "Hammann" was able to recover both fighter pilots, but "Perkins" was unable to locate the TBD's crew. Both destroyers returned to "Yorktown"s task force late that evening as the task force turned away from Guadalcanal toward the southeast in order to refuel and rendezvous with "Lexington" the next day.

On 5 May, "Kikuzuki" slid off of the shore of Gavutu and sank in Tulagi harbor, a total loss (). "Tama Maru" foundered two days later. The other surviving, damaged Japanese ships were able to reach Rabaul and <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> for repairs. "Hagoromo Maru" and "Noshiro Maru #2" joined the Port Moresby Invasion Group. On 10 May, as "Okinoshima" participated in the first Japanese attempt to take <a href="Banaba%20Island">Ocean (Banaba)</a> and <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a> Islands, titled <a href="Operation%20RY">Operation "RY"</a>, she was sunk by the submarine off New Ireland (). A total of 87 Japanese naval personnel died in the 4 May air attacks on Tulagi, and 36 of the landing troops were seriously injured.

The lost "Yorktown" TBD aircrew reached Guadalcanal after drifting in the ocean for three days. A <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> missionary took them to Martin Clemens who arranged for a boat to take them to <a href="Makira">San Cristobal</a>. From San Cristobal, another boat took them to the New Hebrides and from there they eventually rejoined U.S. forces.

After striking Tulagi, "Yorktown" rejoined with "Lexington", and the two carriers engaged the rest of the Japanese forces involved in the "Mo" operation from 6–8 May in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>. In the battle, "Lexington" was sunk and "Yorktown" was damaged. The Japanese suffered "Shōhō" sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">ultimately unsuccessful overland attack</a> along the <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a>. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.
Despite the damaging air attacks to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded with the construction of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the <a href="Yokohama%20Air%20Group">Yokohama Air Group</a> which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17s</a> based at Port Moresby, <a href="Efate">Efate</a>, <a href="Noumea">Noumea</a>, and <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a> frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.

The Allies were greatly concerned about the Japanese airfield construction effort on Guadalcanal because, when completed, the aircraft operating from the airfield would be a significant threat to Allied operations between Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. The two strategic victories for the Allies in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway provided an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. An Allied plan to attack the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral <a href="Ernest%20King">Ernest King</a>, Commander in Chief, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">United States Fleet</a>. He proposed the offensive to deny the use of the southern Solomon Islands by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> to threaten the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to use them as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a>. His goal was to neutralize or capture the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>, with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines. U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz—Allied commander-in chief for Pacific forces—created the South Pacific theater—with U.S. Vice Admiral <a href="Robert%20L.%20Ghormley">Robert L. Ghormley</a> in command—to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons.

The failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby and their defeat at Midway had the effect of leaving their base at Tulagi without effective protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base. On 7 August 1942, 11,000 <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a> landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo</a> while the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal <a href="Battle%20for%20Henderson%20Field">captured</a> the <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">airfield at Lunga Point</a> without significant resistance. Thus began the <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a> that resulted in a series of large, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next six months which—along with the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>—would decide the fate of Japanese efforts to secure the southern frontier of their empire in the Pacific.

The Greencards

The Greencards are an American <a href="progressive%20bluegrass">progressive bluegrass</a> band that formed in 2003 in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, and relocated in 2005 to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. The band was founded by Englishman <a href="Eamon%20McLoughlin">Eamon McLoughlin</a> and Australians <a href="Kym%20Warner">Kym Warner</a> and <a href="Carol%20Young">Carol Young</a>. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, "<a href="Movin%27%20On%20%28The%20Greencards%20album%29">Movin' On</a>", in 2003, and two albums, "<a href="Weather%20and%20Water">Weather and Water</a>" and "<a href="Viridian%20%28album%29">Viridian</a>", on the <a href="Dualtone%20Records">Dualtone</a> <a href="record%20label">record label</a>. Their fourth album, "<a href="Fascination%20%28album%29">Fascination</a>", was released on <a href="Sugar%20Hill%20Records%20%28bluegrass%29">Sugar Hill</a> in 2009. Their fifth album, "<a href="The%20Brick%20Album">The Brick Album</a>" (2011), was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the "bricks" that make up the cover art.

Their debut album, "Movin' On", was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on <a href="Americana%20%28music%29">Americana</a> radio stations. <a href="Country%20Music%20Television">Country Music Television</a> named their follow-up "Weather and Water" as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> in the same year. "Viridian" would go on to take the number one position on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine's <a href="Billboard%20charts">Bluegrass Music Chart</a>, making the Greencards the first international band to do so. "Viridian" was a critically praised album, and was nominated for <a href="ARIA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Country%20Album">Best Country Album</a> by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a>. The track "Mucky the Duck" from "Viridian" was nominated as the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Country%20Instrumental%20Performance">Best Country Instrumental Performance</a> at the <a href="50th%20Grammy%20Awards">50th Grammy Awards</a>.

The Greencards are noted for their incorporation of other genres of music within an American bluegrass sound. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the "<a href="newgrass">newgrass</a>" movement, they draw from <a href="Irish%20folk%20music">Irish folk music</a>, <a href="Romani%20music">gypsy music</a>, <a href="rock%20%27n%27%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a>, <a href="folk%20ballad">folk ballad</a>ry, and <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin American music</a>al sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a>, and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music.

Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and resides in Nashville. <a href="Carl%20Miner">Carl Miner</a>, originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar. Miner won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and he resides in Nashville.

The Greencards were initially composed of two Australians, Kym Warner on <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and Carol Young on <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a>, and an Englishman, Eamon McLoughlin on <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>. Raised in <a href="South%20London">South London</a>, McLoughlin began to perform country music shows with his family on weekends, influenced by <a href="George%20Jones">George Jones</a>, <a href="George%20Strait">George Strait</a>, and <a href="Ricky%20Skaggs">Ricky Skaggs</a>. Born to <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> parents, McLoughlin's father was head of a London-based country band. At age nine, McLoughlin moved away from piano lessons to play fiddle, and performed with his father's band. McLoughlin had earlier relocated from Brighton to Austin in 1997, after leaving the <a href="University%20of%20Sussex">University of Sussex</a> with a degree in Politics and American Studies. Trained in London studying <a href="ABRSM">Royal Schools of Music Grades</a> before emigrating, McLoughlin also toured with the <a href="Asylum%20Street%20Spankers">Asylum Street Spankers</a>, <a href="Austin%20Lounge%20Lizards">Austin Lounge Lizards</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Robison">Bruce Robison</a> and <a href="Ray%20Wylie%20Hubbard">Ray Wylie Hubbard</a> after arriving in the United States.

Prior to the founding of The Greencards, Young won the Australian Independent Country Artist of the Year award in 2000, and had recorded two No. 1 Australian-charted country music singles. Young was a singer in <a href="Outback">Outback</a> country bands and acts, including <a href="Gina%20Jeffreys">Gina Jeffreys</a>. Young was previously nominated as "Best Female Vocalist" by the <a href="Country%20Music%20Association%20of%20Australia">Country Music Association of Australia</a>, and won the Australian independent country artist of the year award in 2000 due in part to her No. 1 singles "True Blue Fool" and "Part of the Past".

Warner was an aspiring bluegrass musician (which was unusual in Australia) after learning of the music from his father, an early Australian bluegrass pioneer. The winner of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in <a href="Kasey%20Chambers">Kasey Chambers</a>'s band. Young and Warner knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had been drawn to bluegrass and <a href="American%20roots%20music">American roots music</a> through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young made the decision to emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young and Warner later lived together in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> while trying to find work in the moribund Australian bluegrass scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in <a href="West%20Texas">West Texas</a> before relocating to Austin.

On an early trip the pair took to Austin, Warner and Young met McLoughlin at a recording session. Warner was producing an album for the recording artist Bill Atkins and found they needed a fiddle player, which led to the recruitment of McLoughlin. Initially the immigrants came to know one another through their mutual love of <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a>, <a href="Benny%20Hill">Benny Hill</a>, and "<a href="Fawlty%20Towers">Fawlty Towers</a>". They began to have jam sessions afterwards and there was evident chemistry between the trio, which led to their writing songs together. They named themselves The Greencards in honor of the fact that all three band members carried <a href="United%20States%20Permanent%20Resident%20Card">United States green cards</a>. They eventually began to perform shows locally in Austin to finance the recording of what would become their debut album, 2003's "Movin' On". In the process, they became one of the most popular musical groups in Austin. Representative of an emerging "newgrass" movement, the Greencards' acoustic sound was said to incorporate eclectic influences from Irish traditional, Romani gypsy, and Latin American musical sources.

Their first performance together as a band was at the Austin <a href="Irish%20pub">Irish pub</a> Mother Egan's. Given a noon to 3 pm time slot, they began to fill the pub with patrons week after week. Their fans at Mother Egan's soon began calling them the "Bluegrass Bunch". Several months later, The Greencards began performing an additional three to five times per week in Austin, in addition to their Mother Egan's Sunday show. Warner credited the frantic pace of their performance schedule during their Austin formation to their cohesion as a group and with driving them to create more new original music. During their time performing locally in Austin, they toured with various local Texas musicians, including <a href="Robert%20Earl%20Keen">Robert Earl Keen</a>. Warner said that during their early career performing together, audiences would always assume they were American musicians until they finally spoke between songs, revealing their English and Australian accents.

Mario Tarradell of <a href="WFAA-TV">WFAA-TV</a> news called the idea of an American bluegrass band composed of two Australians and an Englishman not as "outrageous" as it may seem. He quoted McLoughlin in an interview:

The ironic thing is that we grew up listening to primarily American music and fell in love with American music. I love <a href="country%20music">country music</a>. I grew up with George Jones and <a href="Charley%20Pride">Charley Pride</a> and <a href="Jim%20Reeves">Jim Reeves</a>. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into <a href="Tammy%20Wynette">Tammy Wynette</a>. <a href="Trev%20Warner">Trev Warner</a> is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.

In 2003, The Greencards recorded and self-released "<a href="Movin%27%20On%20%28The%20Greencards%20album%29">Movin' On</a>", their debut album, which sold 10,000 copies at shows and online, and entered the top five on the Americana radio charts. <a href="Pat%20Flynn%20%28musician%29">Pat Flynn</a>, one of the band members of the <a href="New%20Grass%20Revival">New Grass Revival</a>, guested on the recording of "Movin' On" as a <a href="session%20musician">session</a> guitarist, and would return to do so again on "Weather and Water". The album was said to break past traditional rules of bluegrass music by integrating a <a href="jam-band">jam-band</a> mindset while blending classical folk balladry and <a href="rock%20%27n%27%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a> into the sound. Contrasting with that appraisal, the album was also cited as a traditional and successful "<a href="low%20fidelity">lo-fi</a>" approach to bluegrass music. Critics noted the <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> solos on mandolin, fiddle, and guitar on "Movin' On".

The Greencards gained more fans and became known by name quickly after the release of "Movin' On". The band was credited with performing the most energetic sets during the course of the 2004 <a href="Austin%20City%20Limits%20Music%20Festival">Austin City Limits Music Festival</a>, were said to bring a global sound to bluegrass, and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>—were pushing the genre's boundaries. Their live show during this period was ranked by the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" in the top five nights of live music for the year in 2004.

"Movin' On" earned The Greencards the 2004 Austin Music Award for Best New Band. Several months after the awards, the band was signed by Dualtone Records and began work on their next album, "Weather and Water". The label re-released "Movin' On" at the beginning of 2005, generating still more airplay and sales.

Their second Dualtone album, "<a href="Weather%20and%20Water">Weather and Water</a>", was released on June 28, 2005. Warned stated that during the recording sessions, Dualtone Records let them record what they wanted, with no interference or changes requested. In a review of "Weather and Water" in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", it was noted that on this album, unlike their debut, the focus was on the music supporting lyrics, rather than the blues virtuosity of "Movin' On". All three members of the band sang on "Weather and Water", but Young's voice was noted for its "dreamy, haunting quality". Their music through the "Weather and Water" album had been called <a href="Celtic%20music">Celtic</a>-influenced and bluegrass-flavored by John Lehndorff of the "<a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20News">Rocky Mountain News</a>", but he noted that the band had a distinctly American sound despite their overseas origins. In early 2005, The Greencards performed at <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> in Austin for the first time, and afterwards made their debut at the prestigious <a href="MerleFest">MerleFest</a>.

Jason Gonulsen of "Glide Magazine" noted that The Greencards' debut "Movin' On" did not capture the band's live energy, but that "Weather and Water" overcame this, and was one of 2005's best bluegrass albums. The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for the band's single "Time" from "Weather and Water" received heavy airplay and rotation on Country Music Television. "Time" was described as the centerpiece track of "Weather and Water". "Weather and Water" was also cited as expanding the boundaries of the bluegrass genre.

Country Music Television named "Weather and Water" one of its ten favorite bluegrass albums of the year, saying, "At the nexus of bluegrass, country and pop, this charming trio immediately win over such diverse audiences in concert. Luckily, their winning personality translates to this disc—even with several melancholy, yet melodic, songs. Not for nothing did Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson choose them to open their summer tour of <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league ballparks</a>." The Greencards were the opening act for Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer tour. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an engineer who worked on "Weather and Water", with helping them get the opportunity to tour with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had previously served as an engineer on recordings for <a href="Alison%20Krauss">Alison Krauss</a>, <a href="Nickel%20Creek">Nickel Creek</a> and <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a>. "He makes the best-sounding acoustic records in the world", according to Warner. Throughout 2005 they toured extensively with Dylan and Nelson, and afterwards toured with <a href="Tommy%20Emmanuel">Tommy Emmanuel</a>. During the summer segment of the 2005 tour with Nelson and Dylan, Warner wanted to have the opportunity to pick Dylan's brain about music and performing. However, Warner did not get to spend much time alone with Dylan during their time on the road together. Dylan later told Warner at the end of the tour, "You'll be fine from now on."

At the end of 2005, The Greencards relocated from Austin to Nashville, to be closer to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album "Weather and Water", the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album "Movin' On" to instead concentrate on <a href="Americana%20%28music%29">Americana</a>-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in <a href="Wilkesboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilkesboro, North Carolina</a>. The band was nominated in the <a href="Americana%20Music%20Honors%20%26amp%3B%20Awards">Americana Music Association Awards</a> for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in <a href="Bryan%2C%20Texas">Bryan, Texas</a> on the way back to Austin, but with no serious injuries.

On their previous albums, The Greencards had individually recorded their musical tracks separately in isolation booths of recording studios. For "Viridian", the band members recorded their album together in real time in an open room, which was said to be a factor in creating a spontaneous feel for some of the album. Most of the songs on "Viridian" are sung by Young, and all of the tracks were written by The Greencards, with the exception of "Travel On", which was penned by <a href="Kim%20Richey">Kim Richey</a> of Nashville. Their sound, through "Viridian", was likened to the Canadian <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> band <a href="The%20Duhks">The Duhks</a>. After its release, "Viridian" claimed the No. 1 position on "Billboard" magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart. Doug Lancio, a producer who had previously worked with <a href="Patty%20Griffin">Patty Griffin</a>, was said to have been a positive factor in the success of "Viridian". Prior to the 2007 album, Lancio had not worked with The Greencards. The Greencards are the first international musical act to reach No. 1 on the Bluegrass Music Chart.

In a review of "Viridian", Embo Blake of "Hybrid Magazine" noted Carol Young's vocal skill, as she "effortlessly <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s cadence" on the track "Waiting On The Night". According to the <a href="WFAA">WFAA-TV</a> in <a href="Dallas%E2%80%93Fort%20Worth%20Metroplex">Dallas/Fort Worth</a>, the album has a traditional bluegrass core, with a worldly flavor. Bruce Elder of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" called "Viridian" a "<a href="wikt%3ASpecial%3ASearch/tour%20de%20force">tour de force</a>".

In the wake of "Viridian", The Greencards have been internationally referred to as one of the most popular Americana musical acts in the United States. Bruce Elder went on to say that the band may, after "Viridian", be the best country music performers to ever come out of Australia. In 2007, they were nominated for <a href="ARIA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Country%20Album">Best Country Album</a> at the 21st <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> awards, ultimately losing to <a href="Keith%20Urban">Keith Urban</a>. In December 2007, it was announced that their song "Mucky the Duck" from "Viridian" was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Country%20Instrumental%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance</a> at the 50th Grammy Awards, but it <a href="50th%20Grammy%20Awards%23Country">ultimately lost</a> to <a href="Brad%20Paisley">Brad Paisley</a>'s "Throttleneck". Written by Warner, "Mucky the Duck" was inspired by one of the band's favorite Houston musical venues, The Mucky Duck. Eamon McLoughlin is a regular blogger for Country Music Television. After the Grammy Awards, he wrote about the band's experience at the event, noting that despite not winning, the bar had been raised for their next album.

The Greencards announced on their website in August 2008 that they had returned to the studio to record their fourth album with producer <a href="Jay%20Joyce">Jay Joyce</a>. In September 2008, again via their website, they announced that they signed with Sugar Hill Records for their fourth album, to be released in spring 2009.

On April 21, 2009, The Greencards released their fourth studio album, "Fascination". Warner describes the album as "their most focused" work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward ideas for the music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For "Fascination", he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, "We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which was more of a traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all of the people you meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles."

According to Young, the music on "Fascination" was a progression for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While we still have the bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is "our own little sound". The track "The Crystal Merchant" was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Country%20Instrumental%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance</a>.

In 2009, The Greencards continued to tour, performing again at MerleFest, the Strawberry Park Bluegrass Festival in <a href="Preston%2C%20Connecticut">Preston, Connecticut</a>, Bluegrass in the Park in Henderson, Kentucky, and were on the bill for <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a>.

On November 8, 2010, The Greencards announced that they would self-finance the production on their next album, set for May 2011, rather than taking an advance from a record company. The "Buy A Brick" campaign is selling a package of an advance copy of the final CD, a digital image of the album artwork, video updates of the recording of the album and the subscriber's name (up to twenty characters) on the album artwork. Subscriptions are either $100 or $200 US with the more expensive package getting the album one week earlier and the subscriber's name on the front of the CD package.

Considered by critics to be part of the <a href="progressive%20bluegrass">progressive bluegrass</a> ("newgrass") musical school, The Greencards draw from a wide variety of musical influences, ranging from Bob Dylan and the Beatles to the Celtic tone of Irish traditional music, gypsy themes, and <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a> sounds. Despite the wide array of influences that shape their music, The Greencards have always maintained a distinctively Americana sound. While the various sounds that influence their work are always detectable, none ever dominate the band's music. Jim Abbott of the "Tribune News Service" described The Greencards as polished, "earthy, charming roots music with a sophisticated sheen", but noted that some bluegrass purists may miss the vocal idiosyncrasies that can be found on other acts such as the <a href="Del%20McCoury%20Band">Del McCoury Band</a>. Their appeal has been attributed to both their "instrumental dexterity" as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions. The progressive nature of The Greencards' bluegrass sound has been compared to <a href="Nickel%20Creek">Nickel Creek</a> and <a href="Alison%20Krauss">Alison Krauss & Union Station</a>.

The Greencards' work on "Movin' On" had a looser, jam-based feeling to it, which they later firmed into a more polished sound after relocating to Nashville from Austin for "Weather and Water". John T. Davis in "No Depression Magazine" stated The Greencards' best work on "Weather and Water" contained a "stillness", which he felt contrasted with the speed and "frantic" pace of some of the songs on "Movin' On". While other critics had mentioned The Greencards in the context of jam bands, Davis went on to say that he felt the band was not one, and that they favored a leaner and "clean" sound driven more by Celtic roots.

During their 2005 tour with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of "The Washington Post" believed that The Greencards play traditional American music better than some Americans do, because of their deep respect for bluegrass and the Americana sound. According to David McPherson in "Bluegrass Unlimited" magazine, the band's three-part harmonies evoke the soul sounds of <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>. Kym Warner has said that Robert Earl Keen, <a href="Kelly%20Willis">Kelly Willis</a>, and Patty Griffin were key influences musically in The Greencards's sound during their time in Austin, with the previously unreleased Griffin song "What You Are" being covered on their album "Weather and Water". The recordings on "Viridian", in particular the songs "River of Sand", "Waiting on the Night" and "When I Was in Love With You", were said to evoke the sounds of progressive folk rock that emerged in the 1960s. In "Nashville Scene", Edd Hurt noted the eclectic tone of the band's overall body of recordings, and believed that their albums belonged to the tradition of <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> musicians.

Their musical appeal to fans has been attributed to both their "instrumental dexterity" as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions. Naila Francis described The Greencards's sound as having a mellow tone, with "tender ballards and yarns" in their songs, but punctuated by bursts of energetic musical restlessness. Country Music Television in particular noted their melancholy but melodic sound. The Greencards have described their sound as "high energy acoustic music".

Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 <a href="Graphic%20novel">graphic</a> <a href="memoir">memoir</a> by the American cartoonist <a href="Alison%20Bechdel">Alison Bechdel</a>, author of the <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Dykes%20to%20Watch%20Out%20For">Dykes to Watch Out For</a>". It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>, <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s, <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, <a href="emotional%20abuse">emotional abuse</a>, <a href="dysfunctional%20family">dysfunctional family</a> life, and the role of <a href="literature">literature</a> in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating "Fun Home" took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.

"Fun Home" has been both a popular and critical success, and spent two weeks on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller list</a>. In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Sunday Book Review</a>", <a href="Sean%20Wilsey">Sean Wilsey</a> called it "a pioneering work, pushing two genres (<a href="comics">comics</a> and memoir) in multiple new directions." Several publications named "Fun Home" as one of the best books of 2006; it was also included in several lists of the best books of the 2000s. It was nominated for several awards, including the <a href="National%20Book%20Critics%20Circle%20Award">National Book Critics Circle Award</a> and three <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a>s (one of which it won). A French translation of "Fun Home" was serialized in the newspaper "<a href="Lib%C3%A9ration">Libération</a>"; the book was an official selection of the <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme%20International%20Comics%20Festival">Angoulême International Comics Festival</a> and has been the subject of an academic conference in France. "Fun Home" has been the subject of numerous academic publications in areas such as biography studies and <a href="cultural%20studies">cultural studies</a>, as part of a larger turn towards serious academic investment in the study of <a href="comics">comics</a>/<a href="sequential%20art">sequential art</a>.

"Fun Home" also generated controversy: a public library in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> removed it from its shelves for five months after local residents objected to its contents, and the book's use in universities in Utah and South Carolina has been challenged. Bechdel later traced her maternal relationship in <a href="Are%20You%20My%20Mother%3F%20%28memoir%29">"Are You My Mother?: A Comic Drama"</a>.

In 2013 a <a href="Fun%20Home%20%28musical%29">musical adaptation of "Fun Home"</a> at <a href="The%20Public%20Theater">The Public Theater</a> enjoyed multiple extensions to its run, with book and lyrics written by <a href="Obie%20Award">Obie Award</a>-winning playwright <a href="Lisa%20Kron">Lisa Kron</a>, and score composed by <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>-nominated <a href="Jeanine%20Tesori">Jeanine Tesori</a>. The production, directed by <a href="Sam%20Gold">Sam Gold</a>, was called "the first mainstream musical about a young lesbian." As a <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a> piece, "Fun Home" was a finalist for the 2014 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a>, while winning the <a href="Lucille%20Lortel%20Award">Lucille Lortel Award</a> for Outstanding Musical, the <a href="New%20York%20Drama%20Critics%27%20Circle">New York Drama Critics' Circle</a> Award for Best Musical, and the <a href="Obie%20Award">Obie Award</a> for Musical Theater. The <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway production</a> opened in April 2015 and earned an even dozen nominations for the <a href="69th%20Tony%20Awards">69th Tony Awards</a>, winning the <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Musical">Tony Award for Best Musical</a>.

The narrative of "Fun Home" is <a href="nonlinear%20%28arts%29">non-linear</a> and recursive. Incidents are told and re-told in the light of new information or themes. Bechdel describes the structure of "Fun Home" as a <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a>, "going over the same material, but starting from the outside and spiraling in to the center of the story." In an essay on memoirs and truth in the <a href="academic%20journal">academic journal</a> "<a href="Modern%20Language%20Association">PMLA</a>", <a href="Nancy%20K.%20Miller">Nancy K. Miller</a> explains that as Bechdel revisits scenes and themes "she re-creates memories in which the force of attachment generates the structure of the memoir itself." Additionally, the memoir derives its structure from <a href="allusion">allusion</a>s to various works of literature, <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myth</a> and <a href="visual%20arts">visual arts</a>; the events of Bechdel's family life during her childhood and adolescence are presented through this allusive lens. Miller notes that the narratives of the referenced literary texts "provide clues, both true and false, to the mysteries of family relations."

The memoir focuses on Bechdel's family, and is centered on her relationship with her father, Bruce. Bruce Bechdel was a <a href="funeral%20director">funeral director</a> and high school <a href="English%20studies">English</a> teacher in <a href="Beech%20Creek%2C%20Pennsylvania">Beech Creek</a>, where Alison and her siblings grew up. The book's title comes from the family nickname for the <a href="funeral%20home">funeral home</a>, the family business in which Bruce Bechdel grew up and later worked; the phrase also refers ironically to Bruce Bechdel's tyrannical domestic rule. Bruce Bechdel's two occupations are reflected in "Fun Home"s focus on death and literature.

In the beginning of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a <a href="the%20closet">closeted</a> <a href="homosexuality">homosexual</a>. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an oncoming <a href="Sunbeam%20Bread">Sunbeam Bread</a> truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a>.

The story also deals with Alison Bechdel's own struggle with her sexual identity, reaching a catharsis in the realization that she is a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> and her <a href="coming%20out">coming out</a> to her parents. The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood <a href="diary">diary</a>, anecdotes about <a href="masturbation">masturbation</a>, and tales of her first sexual experiences with her girlfriend, Joan. In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share <a href="obsessive-compulsive">obsessive-compulsive</a> tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: "I was <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n to my father's <a href="History%20of%20Athens%23Classical%20Athens">Athenian</a>. <a href="Modernism">Modern</a> to his Victorian. <a href="Butch%20and%20femme">Butch</a> to his nelly. Utilitarian to his <a href="aestheticism">aesthete</a>." This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s: "Not only were we <a href="sexual%20inversion%20%28sexology%29">inverts</a>, we were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me. It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation." However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.

At several points in the book, Bechdel questions whether her decision to come out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her father's suicide. This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.

Bechdel describes her journey of discovering her own sexuality: "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about in a manner consistent with my bookish upbringing." Yet, hints of her sexual orientation arose early in her childhood; she wished "for the right to exchange [her] tank suit for a pair of shorts" in Cannes and for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. Her father also exhibited homosexual behaviors, but the revelation of this made Bechdel feel uneasy. "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy". Father and daughter handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact, before she had a lesbian relationship, but her father hid his sexuality. He was afraid of coming out, as illustrated by "the fear in his eyes" when the conversation topic comes dangerously close to homosexuality.

In addition to sexual orientation, the memoir touches on the theme of gender identity. Bechdel had viewed her father as "a big sissy"" while her father constantly tried to change his daughter into a more feminine person throughout her childhood.

The underlying theme of death is also portrayed. Unlike most young people, the Bechdel children have a tangible relationship with death because of the family mortuary business. Alison ponders whether her father's death was an accident or suicide, and finds it more likely that he killed himself purposefully.

The allusive literary references used in "Fun Home" are not merely structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, "I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms. And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison." Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> and <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a>. As a child, she confused her family and their <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> home with <a href="the%20Addams%20Family">the Addams Family</a> seen in the cartoons of <a href="Charles%20Addams">Charles Addams</a>. Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>' novel "<a href="A%20Happy%20Death">A Happy Death</a>" and essay "<a href="The%20Myth%20of%20Sisyphus">The Myth of Sisyphus</a>". His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to "<a href="The%20Great%20Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>" by <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald's, as portrayed in the biography "<a href="The%20Far%20Side%20of%20Paradise">The Far Side of Paradise</a>". His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a> novels "<a href="Washington%20Square%20%28novel%29">Washington Square</a>" and "<a href="The%20Portrait%20of%20a%20Lady">The Portrait of a Lady</a>". Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress, and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>", and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was "a harbinger of my parents' later marriage". Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>" is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">In Search of Lost Time</a>". The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to <a href="E.%20H.%20Shepard">E. H. Shepard</a>'s illustrations for "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows">The Wind in the Willows</a>". Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs: the father gives the daughter "Earthly Paradise", an autobiographical collection of the writings of <a href="Colette">Colette</a>; shortly afterwards, in what Alison Bechdel describes as "an eloquent unconscious gesture", she leaves a library copy of <a href="Kate%20Millett">Kate Millett</a>'s memoir "Flying" for him. Finally, returning to the Daedalus myth, Alison Bechdel casts herself as <a href="Stephen%20Dedalus">Stephen Dedalus</a> and her father as <a href="Leopold%20Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a> in <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>", with parallel references to the myth of <a href="Telemachus">Telemachus</a> and <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>.

The chapter headings, too, are all literary allusions. The first chapter, "Old Father, Old Artificer," refers to line in <a href="James%20Joyce">Joyce's</a> "<a href="A%20Portrait%20of%20the%20Artist%20as%20a%20Young%20Man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>", and the second, "A Happy Death," invokes the Camus novel. "That Old Catastrophe" is a line from <a href="Wallace%20Stevens">Wallace Stevens's</a> "<a href="Sunday%20Morning%20%28poem%29">Sunday Morning</a>," and "In the Shadow of the Young Girls in Flower" is the literal translation of the title of one of the volumes of <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust's</a> "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">In Search of Lost Time</a>", which is usually given in English as "<a href="Within%20a%20Budding%20Grove">Within a Budding Grove</a>".

In addition to the literary allusions which are explicitly acknowledged in the text, Bechdel incorporates visual allusions to television programs and other items of <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a> into her artwork, often as images on a television in the background of a panel. These visual references include the film "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>", <a href="Bert%20and%20Ernie">Bert and Ernie</a> of "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>", the <a href="Smiley%20Face">Smiley Face</a>, <a href="Yogi%20Bear">Yogi Bear</a>, "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>", the <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20Road%20Runner">Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote</a>, the resignation of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and "<a href="The%20Flying%20Nun">The Flying Nun</a>".

"Fun Home" is drawn in black <a href="line%20art">line art</a> with a gray-blue ink <a href="wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">wash</a>. Sean Wilsey wrote that "Fun Home"'s <a href="panel%20%28comics%29">panels</a> "combine the detail and technical proficiency of <a href="Robert%20Crumb">R. Crumb</a> with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own." Writing in the "Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide", Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted "Bechdel's habit of drawing her characters very simply and yet distinctly" with "the attention to detail that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, not to mention the intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop." Bechdel told an interviewer for "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>" that the richness of each panel of "Fun Home" was very deliberate:
Bechdel wrote and illustrated "Fun Home" over a seven-year period. Her meticulous artistic process made the task of illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in <a href="Adobe%20Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>, on which she placed the text and drew rough figures. She used extensive <a href="Photo-referencing">photo reference</a> and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a <a href="digital%20camera">digital camera</a> to record her poses. Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used <a href="Google%20Images">Google Images</a> to find a photograph of the New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period. She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative. After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish <a href="Bristol%20board">Bristol board</a> for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer. The gray-blue ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of watercolor paper, and combined with the inked image using <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. Bechdel chose the bluish wash color for its flexibility, and because it had "a bleak, elegiac quality" which suited the subject matter. Bechdel attributes this detailed creative process to her "barely controlled obsessive-compulsive disorder".

"Fun Home" was first printed in hardcover by <a href="Houghton%20Mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</a> (<a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>) on June 8, 2006. This edition appeared on the "New York Times"‘ Hardcover Nonfiction bestseller list for two weeks, covering the period from June 18 to July 1, 2006. It continued to sell well, and by February 2007 there were 55,000 copies in print. A <a href="Paperback%23Trade%20paperback">trade paperback</a> edition was published in the United Kingdom by <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> under the <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> imprint on September 14, 2006; Houghton Mifflin published a paperback edition under the <a href="Mariner%20Books">Mariner Books</a> imprint on June 5, 2007.
In the summer of 2006, a French translation of "Fun Home" was serialized in the <a href="Paris">Paris</a> newspaper "<a href="Lib%C3%A9ration">Libération</a>" (which had previously serialized "<a href="Persepolis%20%28comic%29">Persepolis</a>" by <a href="Marjane%20Satrapi">Marjane Satrapi</a>). This translation, by Corinne Julve and Lili Sztajn, was subsequently published by on October 26, 2006. In January 2007, "Fun Home" was an official selection of the <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme%20International%20Comics%20Festival">Angoulême International Comics Festival</a>. In the same month, the <a href="English%20language">Anglophone</a> Studies department of the <a href="University%20of%20Tours">Université François Rabelais, Tours</a> sponsored an academic conference on Bechdel's work, with presentations in Paris and <a href="Tours">Tours</a>. At this conference, papers were presented examining "Fun Home" from several perspectives: as containing "trajectories" filled with <a href="paradox">paradox</a>ical tension; as a text interacting with images as a <a href="paratext">paratext</a>; and as a search for meaning using <a href="drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a> as a metaphor. These papers and others on Bechdel and her work were later published in the peer-reviewed journal "GRAAT" ("Groupe de Recherches Anglo-Américaines de Tours", or Tours Anglo-American Research Group).

An Italian translation was published by in January 2007. In Brazil, <a href="Conrad%20Editora">Conrad Editora</a> published a Portuguese translation in 2007. A German translation was published by <a href="Kiepenheuer%20%26amp%3B%20Witsch">Kiepenheuer & Witsch</a> in January 2008. The book has also been translated into Hungarian, Korean, and Polish, and a Chinese translation has been scheduled for publication.

In Spring 2012, Bechdel and literary scholar <a href="Hillary%20Chute">Hillary Chute</a> co-taught a course at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> titled "Lines of Transmission: Comics and Autobiography".

"Fun Home" was positively reviewed in many publications. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" of London described "Fun Home" as "a profound and important book;" <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> called it "a beautiful, assured piece of work;" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran two separate reviews and a feature on the memoir. In one "New York Times" review, <a href="Sean%20Wilsey">Sean Wilsey</a> called "Fun Home" "a pioneering work, pushing two genres (<a href="comics">comics</a> and memoir) in multiple new directions" and "a comic book for lovers of words". <a href="Jill%20Soloway">Jill Soloway</a>, writing in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", praised the work overall but commented that Bechdel's reference-heavy prose is at times "a little opaque". Similarly, a reviewer in "<a href="The%20Tyee">The Tyee</a>" felt that "the narrator's insistence on linking her story to those of various <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myths</a>, <a href="American%20literature">American novels</a> and classic <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">plays</a>" was "forced" and "heavy-handed". By contrast, the "<a href="Seattle%20Times">Seattle Times</a>"' reviewer wrote positively of the book's use of literary reference, calling it "staggeringly literate". "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said that "Fun Home" "shows how powerfully—and economically—the medium can portray autobiographical narrative. With two-part visual and verbal narration that isn't simply synchronous, comics presents a distinctive narrative idiom in which a wealth of information may be expressed in a highly condensed fashion."
Several publications listed "Fun Home" as one of the best books of 2006, including "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" of London, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine and "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>", which ranked it as the best comic book of 2006. <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> named "Fun Home" the best nonfiction debut of 2006, admitting that they were fudging the definition of "debut" and saying, ""Fun Home" shimmers with regret, compassion, annoyance, frustration, pity and love—usually all at the same time and never without a pervasive, deeply literary irony about the near-impossible task of staying true to yourself, and to the people who made you who you are." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called it the best nonfiction book of the year, and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" named "Fun Home" the best book of 2006, describing it as "the unlikeliest literary success of 2006" and "a masterpiece about two people who live in the same house but different worlds, and their mysterious debts to each other."

"Fun Home" was a finalist for the 2006 <a href="National%20Book%20Critics%20Circle%20Award">National Book Critics Circle Award</a>, in the memoir/autobiography category. In 2007, "Fun Home" won the <a href="GLAAD%20Media%20Awards">GLAAD Media Award</a> for Outstanding Comic Book, the <a href="Stonewall%20Book%20Award">Stonewall Book Award</a> for non-fiction, the <a href="Judy%20Grahn%23Awards">Publishing Triangle-Judy Grahn Nonfiction Award</a>, and the <a href="Lambda%20Literary%20Award">Lambda Literary Award</a> in the "Lesbian Memoir and Biography" category. "Fun Home" was nominated for the 2007 <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a>s in two categories, Best Reality-Based Work and Best Graphic Album, and Bechdel was nominated as Best Writer/Artist. "Fun Home" won the Eisner for Best Reality-Based Work. In 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" placed "Fun Home" at #68 in its list of "New Classics" (defined as "the 100 best books from 1983 to 2008"). "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" included "Fun Home" in its series "1000 novels everyone must read", noting its "beautifully rendered" details.

In 2009, "Fun Home" was listed as one of the best books of the <a href="2000s%20%28decade%29">previous decade</a> by "The Times" of London, "Entertainment Weekly" and Salon.com, and as one of the best comic books of the decade by "<a href="The%20Onion">The Onion</a>"'s <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">A.V. Club</a>.

In 2010, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" literary blog "Jacket Copy" named "Fun Home" as one of "20 classic works of gay literature".

In October 2006, a resident of <a href="Marshall%2C%20Missouri">Marshall, Missouri</a> attempted to have "Fun Home" and <a href="Craig%20Thompson">Craig Thompson</a>'s "<a href="Blankets%20%28graphic%20novel%29">Blankets</a>", both graphic novels, <a href="List%20of%20banned%20books">removed</a> from the city's public library. Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as "pornography" and expressed concern that they would be read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in "reputable, professional book review journals," and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards "the slippery slope of <a href="censorship">censorship</a>". On October 11, 2006, the library's board appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed "Fun Home" and "Blankets" from circulation until the new policy was approved. The committee "decided not to assign a prejudicial label or segregate [the books] by a prejudicial system", and presented a materials selection policy to the board. On March 14, 2007, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees voted to return both "Fun Home" and "Blankets" to the library's shelves. Bechdel described the attempted banning as "a great honor", and described the incident as "part of the whole evolution of the graphic-novel form."

In 2008, an instructor at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> placed "Fun Home" on the syllabus of a mid-level English course, "Critical Introduction to English Literary Forms". One student objected to the assignment, and was given an alternate reading in accordance with the university's religious accommodation policy. The student subsequently contacted a local organization called "No More Pornography", which started an online petition calling for the book to be removed from the syllabus. Vincent Pecora, the chair of the university's English department, defended "Fun Home" and the instructor. The university said that it had no plans to remove the book.

In 2013, Palmetto Family, a conservative South Carolina group affiliated with <a href="Focus%20on%20the%20Family">Focus on the Family</a> and the <a href="Family%20Research%20Council">Family Research Council</a>, challenged the inclusion of "Fun Home" as a reading selection for incoming freshmen at the <a href="College%20of%20Charleston">College of Charleston</a>. Palmetto Family president Oran Smith called the book "pornographic". Bechdel disputed this, saying that pornography is designed to cause sexual arousal, which is not the purpose of her book. College provost George Hynd and associate provost Lynne Ford defended the choice of "Fun Home", pointing out that its themes of identity are especially appropriate for college freshmen. However, seven months later, the Republican-led <a href="South%20Carolina%20House%20of%20Representatives">South Carolina House of Representatives</a> Ways and Means Committee cut the college's funding by $52,000, the cost of the summer reading program, to punish the college for selecting "Fun Home". Rep. Garry Smith, who proposed the cuts, said that in choosing "Fun Home" the university was "promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle". Rep. Stephen Goldfinch, another supporter of the cuts, said, "This book trampled on freedom of conservatives. ... Teaching with this book, and the pictures, goes too far." Bechdel called the funding cut "sad and absurd" and pointed out that "Fun Home" "is after all about the toll that this sort of small-mindedness takes on people's lives." The full state House of Representatives subsequently voted to retain the cuts. College of Charleston students and faculty reacted with dismay and protests to the proposed cuts, and the college's <a href="student%20governments%20in%20the%20United%20States">Student Government Association</a> unanimously passed a resolution urging that the funding be restored. A coalition of ten free-speech organizations wrote a letter to the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Senate">South Carolina Senate</a> Finance Committee, urging them to restore the funds and warning them that "[p]enalising state educational institutions financially simply because members of the legislature disapprove of specific elements of the educational program is educationally unsound and constitutionally suspect". The letter was co-signed by the <a href="National%20Coalition%20Against%20Censorship">National Coalition Against Censorship</a>, the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">ACLU</a> of South Carolina, the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20University%20Professors">American Association of University Professors</a>, the <a href="Modern%20Language%20Association">Modern Language Association</a>, the <a href="Association%20of%20College%20and%20Research%20Libraries">Association of College and Research Libraries</a>, the <a href="American%20Booksellers%20Foundation%20for%20Free%20Expression">American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression</a>, the <a href="Comic%20Book%20Legal%20Defense%20Fund">Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</a>, the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Publishers">Association of American Publishers</a>, the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Teachers%20of%20English">National Council of Teachers of English</a> and the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>. After a nearly week-long debate in which "Fun Home" and Bechdel were compared to slavery, <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a> and <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, the state Senate voted to restore the funding, but redirect the funds towards study of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> and "<a href="The%20Federalist%20Papers">The Federalist Papers</a>"; the university was also required to provide alternate books to students who object to an assignment due to a "religious, moral or cultural belief". Governor <a href="Nikki%20Haley">Nikki Haley</a> approved the budget measure penalizing the university.

In 2015, the book was assigned as summer reading for the incoming class of 2019 at <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>. Several students objected to the book on moral and/or religious grounds.

"Fun Home" has been adapted into a <a href="musical%20theatre">stage musical</a>, with a book by <a href="Lisa%20Kron">Lisa Kron</a> and music by <a href="Jeanine%20Tesori">Jeanine Tesori</a>. The musical was developed through a 2009 workshop at the <a href="Ojai%20Playwrights%20Conference">Ojai Playwrights Conference</a> and workshopped in 2012 at the <a href="Sundance%20Institute%23Sundance%20Theatre%20Program">Sundance Theatre Lab</a> and <a href="The%20Public%20Theater">The Public Theater</a>'s Public Lab. Bechdel did not participate in the musical's creation. She expected her story to seem artificial and distant on stage, but she came to feel that the musical had the opposite effect, bringing the "emotional heart" of the story closer than even her book did.

The musical debuted <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> at The Public Theater on September 30, 2013. The production was directed by <a href="Sam%20Gold">Sam Gold</a> and starred <a href="Michael%20Cerveris">Michael Cerveris</a> and <a href="Judy%20Kuhn">Judy Kuhn</a> as Bruce and Helen Bechdel. The role of Alison was played by three actors: Beth Malone played the adult Alison, reviewing and narrating her life, <a href="Alexandra%20Socha">Alexandra Socha</a> played "Medium Alison" as a student at Oberlin, discovering her sexuality, and Sydney Lucas played Small Alison, at age 10. It received largely positive reviews, and its limited run was extended several times until January 12, 2014. The musical was a finalist for the 2014 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a>; it also won the <a href="Lucille%20Lortel%20Award">Lucille Lortel Award</a> for Outstanding Musical, the <a href="New%20York%20Drama%20Critics%27%20Circle">New York Drama Critics' Circle</a> Award for Best Musical, and the <a href="Obie%20Award">Obie Award</a> for Musical Theater. Alison Bechdel drew a one-page comic about the musical adaptation for the newspaper "<a href="Seven%20Days%20%28newspaper%29">Seven Days</a>".

A <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> production opened at <a href="Circle%20in%20the%20Square%20Theatre">Circle in the Square Theatre</a> in April 2015. The production won five <a href="2015%20Tony%20Awards">2015 Tony Awards</a>, including <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Musical">Best Musical</a>, and ran for 26 previews and 582 regular performances until September 10, 2016, with a national tour that began in October 2016. Kalle Oskari Mattila, in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", argued that the musical's marketing campaign "obfuscates rather than clarifies" the queer narrative of the original novel.

All Souls (TV series)

All Souls is an American <a href="Paranormal%20television">paranormal</a> <a href="medical%20drama">hospital drama</a> created by <a href="Stuart%20Gillard">Stuart Gillard</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Tolkin">Stephen Tolkin</a> and inspired by <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a>'s <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> <a href="The%20Kingdom%20%28miniseries%29">"The Kingdom"</a>. It originally aired for one season on <a href="UPN">UPN</a> from April 17, 2001, to August 31, 2001. The series follows the medical staff of the haunted <a href="teaching%20hospital">teaching hospital</a> All Souls. While working as a <a href="medical%20intern">medical intern</a>, protagonist Dr. Mitchell Grace (<a href="Grayson%20McCouch">Grayson McCouch</a>) encounters various spirits, and discovers that the doctors are running unethical experiments on their patients. The executive producers included <a href="Aaron%20Spelling">Aaron Spelling</a>, <a href="E.%20Duke%20Vincent">E. Duke Vincent</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Frost">Mark Frost</a>.

Gillard developed the premise for "All Souls" from his belief that a medical facility would be an ideal setting for a horror series and his research on statistics of deaths that had taken place in a hospital. Frost also felt that there was a close connection between modern medicine and the supernatural. Though the series was set in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, filming took place in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Canada. Episodes were shot in a working <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>, and real patients appear in the background of several scenes.

"All Souls" had low viewership, and was placed on hiatus following the broadcast of the first two episodes and canceled after the season was broadcast. It has not been released on <a href="home%20video">home video</a> or made available on <a href="Streaming%20media">streaming services</a>. Critical response to "All Souls" was primarily positive; <a href="Television%20criticism">commentators</a> praised its use of horror and paranormal elements. Critics had mixed reviews for the show's content and style when compared to other horror and <a href="Science-fiction%20television">science-fiction</a> television series, specifically "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" and the work of American writer <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>.

Described as a "<a href="Paranormal%20television">paranormal</a> <a href="medical%20drama">hospital drama</a>" by <a href="UPN">UPN</a>, "All Souls" follows the medical staff working in the <a href="Boston">Boston</a> <a href="teaching%20hospital">teaching hospital</a> of the same name. The area has a history dating back to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. A photograph taken during the war is prominently featured in the series, as it shows individuals who still work as part of the staff. The hauntings at All Souls started during the Civil War, when Dr. Abramson conducted experiments on his patients following the death of his three sons in combat. The ghosts of Abramson's victims remain in the hospital to the present day. The facility is composed of "dungeons, trick elevators, deserted floors, passageways filled with smoke and dripping water" and "dark, dank, cavelike areas". It had previously functioned as a <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>, which was housed on the upper levels of the structure's tower.

The main narrative includes "hints of deeper, good-versus-evil contests". Taking inspiration from the <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> genre, the series includes "extreme closeups [and] bizarre sexual transformations". In the pilot episode, a seduction scene with a doctor and a young woman ends when she is revealed to be a corpse, and several women die after being admitted for treatment. Although the series follows a specific mythology and continuity, each episode has its own self-contained story.

UPN executives had <a href="Pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitch</a>ed the series as following "young doctors in peril at a haunted old Boston Hospital" who must contend with "a healthy dose of terrifying paranormal occurrences and gripping medical emergencies". In the pilot episode, Dr. Mitchell Grace (<a href="Grayson%20McCouch">Grayson McCouch</a>) begins working at the hospital immediately after graduating from <a href="Medical%20school%20in%20the%20United%20States">medical school</a>. He had specifically chosen the All Souls medical program, refusing offers from the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> and the <a href="Yale%E2%80%93New%20Haven%20Hospital">Yale–New Haven Hospital</a>, due to his personal connection with the hospital. Grace's father died in 1978 while working as a janitor in the hospital, after contracting a mysterious illness. Grace serves as the show's lead character, and functions as a detective as well as a doctor while trying to understand the inner workings of All Souls. As he works, Grace encounters both good and evil ghosts, and discovers medical experiments are being conducted under the guidance of the <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a>. Spirits include "a mad scientist and his <a href="Igor%20%28character%29">Igor</a>-like errand boy", and a woman dressed in <a href="19th%20century%20in%20fashion">19th century fashion</a> pushing a baby carriage through the halls. Grace is haunted by visions of his father, and is somehow connected with the ghost Lazarus and Civil War doctors. Dr. Dante Ambrosious (<a href="Jean%20LeClerc%20%28actor%29">Jean LeClerc</a>), the <a href="chairman">chair</a> of the facility's board, is shown to have made deals with the evil spirits.

Grace works closely with several allies during his time at All Souls, but is the one of few people who is fully aware of the hospital's supernatural occurrences. He collaborates with <a href="registered%20nurse">registered nurse</a> Glory St. Claire (<a href="Irma%20P.%20Hall">Irma P. Hall</a>), who has a long history with the facility and "knows more than she can say or, at least, explain". She is characterized by her <a href="Telepathy">telepathic</a> powers. According to St. Claire, "the dead have power" in the hospital and the "forces of good" residing inside All Souls had foretold of Grace's arrival for several decades. She connects with Grace by holding his hands to allow him to see the "tortured soul" in the hospital. Grace finds further support from Dr. Nicole De Brae (<a href="Serena%20Scott%20Thomas">Serena Scott Thomas</a>), Dr. Bradley Sterling (<a href="Daniel%20Cosgrove">Daniel Cosgrove</a>), and Patrick Fortado (<a href="Adam%20Rodriguez">Adam Rodriguez</a>). De Brae acts as the hospital's <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> and Sterling works alongside Grace as a <a href="medical%20intern">medical intern</a>. Fortado is Grace's close friend, a <a href="Paraplegia">paraplegic</a> who has great skill at <a href="Hacker">hacking</a>. The exact nature of De Brae's loyalty is called into question, and Tim Goodman of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" wondered if she will serve as a love interest or be revealed as one of the hospital's spirits. Other members of the medical staff include the <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a> Dr. Philomena Cullen (<a href="Reiko%20Aylesworth">Reiko Aylesworth</a>) and the <a href="orderly">orderly</a> Joey (<a href="Christian%20Tessier">Christian Tessier</a>).

Created by <a href="Stuart%20Gillard">Stuart Gillard</a> and Stephen Tolkin, "All Souls" was produced by <a href="Spelling%20Television">Spelling Television</a> and Uncle Monkey Productions. Along with the show's creators, the executive producers included <a href="Aaron%20Spelling">Aaron Spelling</a>, <a href="E.%20Duke%20Vincent">E. Duke Vincent</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Frost">Mark Frost</a>. Media outlets found the pairing of Spelling and Frost for the production strange. <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>'s Steven Oxman described it as a "merging of the beauty and the beast"; he equated Spelling to the beauty for incorporating the "sleek and superficial good looks" and Frost to the beast for his inclusion of "surreal, beastly creepiness". The duo had previously collaborated on the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> television series "<a href="Buddy%20Faro">Buddy Faro</a>".

Gillard felt that a medical facility would be an ideal candidate for a horror show, explaining: "Hospitals are scary places even if you're healthy (and) going to visit somebody." While conducting research to develop the series' concept, he was surprised that roughly 80,000 people die in hospitals every year due to unknown causes. Echoing Gillard's comments, Frost argued there is a close connection between the supernatural and modern medicine. Describing a hospital as a "pretty paranormal place", he felt that medicine would "only have to go one step further to get to the paranormal". "All Souls" was inspired by the <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a> <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> <a href="The%20Kingdom%20%28miniseries%29">"The Kingdom"</a>, and has been compared to the <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> television series "<a href="Kingdom%20Hospital">Kingdom Hospital</a>". While promoting the series, Frost had said the show had been partly inspired by the <a href="Science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama</a> "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>".

Tom Burstyn handled the cinematography, and the production designers were Michael Joy and Collin Niemi. <a href="James%20L.%20Conway">James L. Conway</a> contributed to the show as a consulting producer, and <a href="Joel%20McNeely">Joel McNeely</a> composed the musical score. Although the show is set in Boston, filming took place in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Canada. The episodes were shot in a functioning asylum constructed in Montreal during the <a href="19th%20century">19th century</a>, with real patients walking around during certain scenes, which Frost said added realism.

The series had originated from a production deal between <a href="Syfy">Syfy</a> and <a href="CBS%20Paramount%20Network%20Television">CBS Paramount Network Television</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Vitale">Thomas Vitale</a>, the senior vice president of programming and original movies for Syfy, described the partnership as a way to add more "<a href="genre%20fiction">genre programming</a> to our schedule". It was one of three series (alongside "<a href="Chains%20of%20Love%20%28TV%20series%29">Chains of Love</a>" and "<a href="Special%20Unit%202">Special Unit 2</a>") UPN ordered as <a href="mid-season%20replacement">mid-season replacement</a>s during the <a href="2000-01%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">2000 –2001 television season</a>. The network had requested six episodes of "All Souls" when picking it up for air, and all of them had been shot before its cancellation. <a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">"The Seattle Post-Intelligencer"</a>'s John Levesque felt that the network decided to produce "All Souls" in an attempt to find another successful series following the end of "". While Levesque thought the shows were "promising", he did not believe any of them were a "slam-dunk".

Rodriquez initially refused to audition as he wanted to be a part of the 2000 drama <a href="The%20Street%20%282000%20TV%20series%29">"The Street"</a> instead. After the producers contacted him repeatedly, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling five times and talked to Spelling. After he was not cast in "The Street," he accepted the part of Fortado; he particularly wanted to work on a show produced by Spelling. Filming in a wheelchair gave him an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.
"All Souls" was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, and aired directly after the <a href="Reality%20television">reality television show</a> "Chains of Love". The series carried a <a href="TV-PG">TV-PG</a> parental rating, meaning that it was judged "unsuitable for young children". It premiered on April 17, 2001, and was viewed by 2.1 million people; <a href="Nielsen%20Media%20Research">Nielsen Media Research</a> ranked it 105th for the week.

UPN placed the series on hiatus on April 30, 2001, due to concerns about its low ratings; only two episodes had aired. After announcing the show's hiatus, UPN executives said that it was not canceled at that point. Despite the network's claims, media commentators believed it would be removed from air following its poor performance. The series returned in August and the pilot and remaining episodes aired on Friday nights at 9 pm EST, and were <a href="Burning%20off">burned off</a> throughout August, with the last one airing on August 31, 2001. One <a href="rerun">rerun</a> aired during the month of September. Overall, "All Souls" was broadcast for a total of 360 minutes.

While discussing the cancellation, McCouch felt it was "doomed to fail" from the beginning and referred to UPN as "a loser network at that time" due its treatment of the series. Cosgrove disagreed with McCouch's sentiment and believed that the show's lack of success was not tied to the network specifically. Rodriquez believed that "All Souls" was unsuccessful as it was "just a little ahead of its time"; he felt that the program was better suited for television one to two years following its initial broadcast. The series has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or licensed to on an online-streaming service.

"All Souls" has received positive critical feedback. Eric Mink of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" praised the show's use of horror, and wrote that it would "set the dragging knuckles of UPN's core audience all a-tingle". "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">The Los Angeles Times</a>"' <a href="Howard%20Rosenberg">Howard Rosenberg</a> called the series "paranormal fun", and Lawrence.com's Kevin McDonough referenced "All Souls" as "a classic Aaron Spelling production" primarily due to its editing and special effects. <a href="Charleston%20Daily%20Mail">"The Charleston Daily Mail"</a>'s Kevin McDonough wrote that "All Souls" was "the best show you never watched", responding positively to the show's premise and actors. Mink responded positively to the series' storylines and characters, believing that they had potential for further development.

Reception of the series' pilot was mixed, with <a href="Television%20criticism">television critics</a> divided over its structure. <a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a> of <a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">"The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"</a> gave the first episode a positive review, believing that it set up enough story elements to show promise. Steven Oxman felt that the pilot made effective use of horror tropes, citing a scene in which a preserved fetus moves as a highlight. "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>"s Robert Lloyd had a more mixed response to the series; while he felt that the Grace's initial interactions with St. Clair gave away too much of the plot, he found it "well-made within the limits of its ambitions".

Critics had mixed reviews for "All Souls", when compared to other horror and science-fiction narratives. Tim Goodman noted that "All Souls" had aspects of "The X-Files" as well as from "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>", Stephen King's 1977 novel <a href="The%20Shining%20%28novel%29">"The Shining"</a>, and the medical drama genre. Even though Goodman felt the series had a "scattershot approach", he felt that all the elements worked with one another. Oxman was critical of the show's originality and its setting in a former asylum, saying it was similar to King's work and the 1996 film "<a href="Extreme%20Measures">Extreme Measures</a>", and felt it had "a superficial gloss" when compared to "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>". Despite this criticism, he called "All Souls" "potentially the scariest network show since "The X-Files"".

Chrysiridia rhipheus

Chrysiridia rhipheus, the Madagascan sunset moth, is a day-flying <a href="moth">moth</a> of the family <a href="Uraniidae">Uraniidae</a>. It is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking <a href="lepidoptera">lepidoptera</a>ns. Famous worldwide, it is featured in most <a href="coffee%20table%20book">coffee table book</a>s on Lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors, though many older sources misspell the species name as ""ripheus"". It is very colourful, though the <a href="iridescence">iridescent</a> parts of the <a href="Insect%20wing">wings</a> do not have pigment; rather the colours originate from <a href="optical%20interference">optical interference</a>. Adults have a wingspan of .

<a href="Dru%20Drury">Dru Drury</a>, who described the moth in 1773, placed it in the genus "<a href="Papilio">Papilio</a>", considering it a butterfly. <a href="Jacob%20H%C3%BCbner">Jacob Hübner</a> placed it in the moth genus "Chrysiridia" in 1823. Later redescriptions led to <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29%23Zoology">junior synonyms</a> such as "Chrysiridia madagascariensis" (<a href="Ren%C3%A9-Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">Lesson</a>, 1831).

At first the moth was thought to be from <a href="China">China</a> or <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, but was later found to be <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It is found throughout the year in most parts of the island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of "<a href="Omphalea">Omphalea</a>" <a href="Species%23Abbreviated%20names">spp</a>. The <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s are whitish yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black <a href="setae">setae</a>. <a href="Silk">Silk</a> spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. This silk has also been known to cause a euphoric high to those who consume it. After completing four <a href="instar">instar</a>s, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The <a href="pupa">pupa</a>l stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.
"Chrysiridia rhipheus" is the sole <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">specialist</a> herbivore of the four species of "Omphalea" in Madagascar. "Omphalea" is toxic: the toxins are <a href="Pyrrolizidine%20alkaloid%20sequestration">sequestered</a> by the feeding caterpillar and retained in the pupal and adult stages. Thousands of these moths <a href="Insect%20migration">migrate</a> between the eastern and western ranges of their host plants.

The Madagascan sunset moth was first described by the British entomologist <a href="Dru%20Drury">Dru Drury</a> in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>. Because of its resemblance to <a href="Swallowtail%20butterfly">swallowtail butterflies</a>, Drury described the species as "<a href="Papilio">Papilio</a> rhipheus". The specimen Drury received had the head of a different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a>—this trait is frequently used to <a href="Differences%20between%20butterflies%20and%20moths">differentiate moths from butterflies</a>. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus "<a href="Urania%20%28genus%29">Urania</a>", until 1823 when the German entomologist <a href="Jacob%20H%C3%BCbner">Jacob Hübner</a> placed it in a new genus, "Chrysiridia". The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, <a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William Swainson</a> thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by <a href="Pieter%20Cramer">Pieter Cramer</a>. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly "Rhipheus dasycephalus" and the moth "Leilus orientalis". Other synonyms include "U. crameri" by Maassen in 1879 and "U. ripheus" var. "madagascariensis" by <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">Lesson</a> in 1831.

Native <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy people</a> call it "adriandolo" or "lolonandriana", from "lolo" for "spirit" or "butterfly" and "<a href="andriana">andriana</a>" for "noble" or "king", therefore meaning "noble butterfly", "noble spirit", "king butterfly" or "king spirit".

The genus "Chrysiridia" is entirely African and the only other species in the genus is the <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>n "<a href="Chrysiridia%20croesus">C. croesus</a>". "Chrysiridia" is one of three <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> <a href="Uraniinae">uraniine</a> genera. The other two genera are "Urania", its <a href="Cladistics%23Cladograms">sister taxon</a>, and "Alcides", the most <a href="basal%20%28phylogeny%29">basal</a>. In the group, the use of "<a href="Endospermum">Endospermum</a>" is an ancestral state (a plesiomorphy). The more basal "Alcides" feed on "Endospermum" and "<a href="Omphalea">Omphalea</a>", while "Urania" and "Chrysiridia" feed only on "Omphalea".

"Chrysiridia rhipheus" has a wingspan of , and sometimes up to . Moths from the highlands, , have a median wingspan of ; moths from lower altitudes, , have a median wingspan of . Like many other <a href="Uraniinae">uraniine moths</a>, the sunset moth has an uncanny resemblance to <a href="Swallowtail%20butterfly">swallowtail butterflies</a>, especially in its tails and colourful wings, and can easily be mistaken for a butterfly.

The sunset moth is black with iridescent red, blue and green markings. There is a fringe of white scales on the wing edges, wider on the hindwings. The moth has six tails, very often lost or damaged during its life. Pattern variations are common, and the moth is often partly asymmetrical; one of the factors causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.

Unlike in many other moths, the colour of "C. rhipheus" wings does not come from <a href="Pigment%20%28biology%29">pigments</a>. The colour originates from <a href="coherence%20%28physics%29">coherent</a> scattering and interference of light by the microstructure of the ribbon-like <a href="scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a> covering the moth's wings. These structural characteristics make this species and its <a href="Neotropical">Neotropical</a> relative "Urania" common subjects of research in <a href="Optics">optical science</a>.

The colours on the Madagascan sunset moth's wings are produced by the conjunction of two optical phenomena:
The colour seen in each part of the wing is the combination of the colours reflected by these two effects.

Because the cuticle layers are arranged in rows, with a cylindrical curve, the amount of the second type of reflection is dependent on the <a href="Polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many <a href="insects">insects</a> can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.

Drury's specimen was given to him by Captain May of Hammersmith and believed to have come from <a href="China">China</a>. Cramer believed the specimen came from <a href="Chandannagar">Chandernagore</a> in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, however, giving rise to the French name "page de Chadernagor". It is now known that "Chrysiridia rhipheus" is <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Thousands of adult moths seasonally <a href="Insect%20migration">migrate</a> between geographically isolated populations of their host plant "Omphalea" spp. They can be found almost everywhere on the island, except in the south-west and the extreme subdesertic south of the <a href="Androy">Androy</a> where their host plant is absent. They migrate from the three species in the dry deciduous forest in the west ("O. ankaranensis", "O. occidentalis" and "O. palmata") to the eastern rainforest species ("O. oppositifolia"). The western species are largely in <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s. The eastern species, on the other hand, is mostly unprotected and dispersed in widely scattered populations threatened by <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. Being the only <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> species, "O. oppositifolia" is probably crucial for the moth's survival. The Jamaican moth "<a href="Urania%20sloanus">Urania sloanus</a>", from the same subfamily (Uraniinae), most likely became <a href="Extinction">extinct</a> after the loss of one of its host plant species.

The moths migrate in response to changes in the host plants. "Chrysiridia" larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings. The plants probably <a href="Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory">react</a> by changing their nutrient and <a href="secondary%20compound">secondary compound</a> levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. "Omphalea" populations that are not damaged by moths for long periods of time have lower toxicity. These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes might result from increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through <a href="semiochemical">semiochemical</a>s, the plant may recruit <a href="hymenoptera">hymenoptera</a>n <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a>s as a protection, hence playing a role in the <a href="population%20dynamics">population dynamics</a> of the moth.

Like "C. croesus" and species of the genus "Urania", "C. rhipheus" is a <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">specialist species</a> whose caterpillars feed strictly on species of the pantropical genus "<a href="Omphalea">Omphalea</a>" (<a href="Euphorbiaceae">Euphorbiaceae</a>). Four species of the genus "Omphalea" are endemic to Madagascar:

"Omphalea", like many other members of the Euphorbiaceae, possesses <a href="Extrafloral%20nectaries">leaf nectaries</a> that attract <a href="Polistinae">polistine wasps</a>, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract <a href="ant">ant</a>s. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore "Chrysiridia" caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. "Omphalea" species contain polyhydroxy <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s potentially <a href="Pyrrolizidine%20alkaloid%20sequestration">sequestered</a> or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.

Unlike most moths, the sunset moth is <a href="diurnal%20animal">day flying</a> and the bright <a href="Aposematism">aposematic</a> colours warn predators of its <a href="toxic">toxic</a>ity, a strategy seen in many diurnal moths.
Another habit the moth has in common with many butterflies is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the <a href="Crown%20%28botany%29">crown</a> of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100 m (300 ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.

Continuous generations of the moth are present all year. The highest populations are found from March to August (fall and winter), while the lowest are from October to December (spring).
The females <a href="Oviposition">lay their eggs</a> late in the afternoon or at nightfall, and locate potential oviposition sites visually. Like the eggs of other Uraniidae, the sunset moth's eggs are domed with projecting ribs. A single egg weighs about and usually has 17 ribs, but sometimes 18 or less often 16. The eggs are usually laid on the lower surface of "Omphalea" leaves, but occasionally on the upper surface. Eggs are laid in groups of 60 to 110, usually about 80.

After they hatch, the small caterpillars only eat the tissue (<a href="Ground%20tissue%23Parenchyma">parenchyma</a>) between the <a href="Veinlets">veins</a> of the leaves. They do this to avoid the sticky and toxic <a href="latex">latex</a> produced by the plant's <a href="laticifer">laticifer</a>s and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, <a href="tendril">tendril</a>s, <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a>s and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands at the base of the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of <a href="Insect%20mouthparts">mouthpart</a> coagulation. The caterpillars spin <a href="silk">silk</a> from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black <a href="setae">setae</a>. It has five pairs of <a href="proleg">proleg</a>s on <a href="Caterpillar%23Anatomy">segments</a> 3 to 6 and 10, and six <a href="Arthropod%20leg">true legs</a> attached to the <a href="thorax">thorax</a>.

After completing all but its last <a href="Ecdysis">moult</a>, the caterpillar spins a <a href="Pupa%23Cocoon">cocoon</a> out of <a href="silk">silk</a>. The cocoon can be in the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The <a href="chrysalis">chrysalis</a> stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before <a href="Eclosion%23Emergence">eclosion</a>, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal <a href="exuvia">exuvia</a> (the pupal <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping <a href="haemolymph">haemolymph</a> into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one-and-a-half and two hours later.

Adult moths prefer white or whitish-yellow flowers as a nectar source, which indicates that visual cues play a large role in their selection. Most flowers visited are <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s of small flowers or have dense filaments, giving them the appearance of a bottle brush, often because of the conspicuous projecting <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s as in many <a href="Leguminosae">Leguminosae</a> (<a href="Mimosoideae">Mimosoideae</a>, <a href="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</a> and <a href="Combretaceae">Combretaceae</a>). However, not all white flowers elicit a response: the white and showy flowers of "Omphalea oppositifolia" are not visited by the adult moths. Nectar sources include the flowers of:
All these flowers are white, with the exception of "Camellia sinensis" which has a yellow centre, and all either have dense filaments or are formed of tight clusters of small flowers.
This spectacular moth is considered one of the most impressive and beautiful <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>, rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most <a href="coffee%20table%20book">coffee table book</a>s on the Lepidoptera, and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make <a href="jewellery">jewellery</a> in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>.
The Madagascan sunset moth appeared on a 6 <a href="Lesotho%20loti">maloti</a> <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> in the <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a> Postal Services "Butterflies of Africa" issue of 20 August 2007. Only one of the four species of host plants, "Omphalea oppositifolia", is used to raise the moth commercially, mainly using plants collected in the wild, but also some cultivated for the purpose.

In <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>, "lolo" is <a href="Polysemy">polysemous</a> for "butterfly" or "moth" and "<a href="soul">soul</a>". There is little doubt that this is because a pupa resembles a covered corpse and that the adult emerges from it—like the soul from body of the dead.
The Malagasy people believe the soul of the dead or of ancestors appears in the form of a lepidopteran, and thus to attack it is to attack the ancestors.

 The meaning of the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "rhipheus" was not given by the author Dru Drury. Possibilities include the Latin "Montes Rhipheaus", the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> or <a href="Ripheus">Ripheus</a>, "the most just of all the <a href="Troy">Trojans</a>".

Palace of Queluz

The Palace of Queluz (, ) is a Portuguese 18th-century palace located at <a href="Queluz%20%28Sintra%29">Queluz</a>, a <a href="freguesia">freguesia</a> of the modern-day <a href="Sintra%20Municipality">Sintra Municipality</a>, in the <a href="Lisbon%20District">Lisbon District</a>. One of the last great <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> buildings to be designed in Europe, the palace was conceived as a summer retreat for <a href="Peter%20III%20of%20Portugal">Dom Pedro of Braganza</a>, later to become husband and then <a href="king%20consort">king consort</a> to his own niece, Queen <a href="Maria%20I%20of%20Portugal">Maria I</a>. It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786. Following the destruction by fire of the <a href="Ajuda%20National%20Palace">Ajuda Palace</a> in 1794, Queluz Palace became the official residence of the Portuguese <a href="Regent">prince regent</a> <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">John VI</a>, and his family and remained so until the royal family fled to the <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Portuguese colony of Brazil</a> in 1807 following the French <a href="Invasion%20of%20Portugal%20%281807%29">invasion of Portugal</a>.

Work on the palace began in 1747 under Portuguese architect <a href="Mateus%20Vicente%20de%20Oliveira">Mateus Vicente de Oliveira</a>. Despite being far smaller, the palace is often referred to as the Portuguese <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>. From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted one-third of the interior, the palace was extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction.

One wing of the palace, the <a href="Pousada%20of%20D.%20Maria">Pavilion of Dona Maria</a>, built for <a href="Maria%20I">Maria I</a> between 1785 and 1792 by Portuguese architect <a href="Manuel%20Caetano%20de%20Sousa%20%28architect%29">Manuel Caetano de Sousa</a>, is now a guest house allocated to foreign <a href="Head%20of%20state">heads of state</a> visiting Portugal.

Queluz's architecture is representative of the final extravagant period of Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690. From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists and architects were employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy; they brought with them classical ideas of architecture which derived from the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> which preceded the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> style throughout Europe.

Comparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted: Versailles is referred to as having "an aura of majesty" and it was built and dedicated to exhibit in stone "all the glories of France," whereas the far smaller palace at Queluz has been described as "exquisite rather than magnificent" and looking like "a very expensive birthday cake". In its frivolity, the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the Portuguese royal family at the time of building: during the reign of Dom Pedro's brother, <a href="Joseph%20I%20of%20Portugal">Joseph I</a>, when Portugal was in practice governed by a "valido" or <a href="favourite">favourite</a>, the <a href="Sebasti%C3%A3o%20de%20Melo%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Pombal">Marquis of Pombal</a>. Pombal encouraged the royal family to while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him. Thus the extravagant, almost whimsical architecture of Queluz, set apart from the capital city, exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal during this era, and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants. Queluz's role as a haven for those without responsibility was, however, to be short-lived.

On the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in much the same way as <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick the Great</a> used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, <a href="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a>.
The site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow. It had originally been owned by the <a href="Manuel%20de%20Moura%20y%20Corte%20Real%2C%202nd%20Marquis%20of%20Castel%20Rodrigo">Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo</a>. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then became one of the many properties of the Portuguese king, <a href="John%20IV%20of%20Portugal">João IV</a>. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of <a href="John%20V%20of%20Portugal">João V</a>.

The architect, Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, had trained under <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Frederico%20Ludovice">Ludovice of Ratisbon</a> and <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Robillon">Jean Baptiste Robillon</a> during the construction of the royal palace and <a href="convent">convent</a> of <a href="Mafra%20National%20Palace">Mafra</a>. The more sombre and massive classical palace at Mafra does not appear to have influenced the design for Queluz, which is in a lighter, more airy style. Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until 1755, when it was interrupted by the <a href="1755%20Lisbon%20earthquake">Great earthquake of 1755</a>, after which the labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city. The earthquake proved to be a catalyst, because the urban rebuilding process stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal. The subsequent architecture of Queluz was influenced by new ideas and concepts. When work recommenced in 1758, the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake. Thus the later works take the form of low, long buildings, more structurally stable than a single high block: as a result, viewed from a distance the palace resembles long <a href="enfilade%20%28architecture%29">enfilade</a>s linked by higher <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a>s rather than one single construction.

The public <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a> of the palace faces directly onto a town square and takes the form of two low, symmetrical, <a href="quadrant%20%28architecture%29">quadrant</a> wings which flank the forward-reaching wings of a small central "<a href="corps%20de%20logis">corps de logis</a>", thus forming a semi-circular <a href="cour%20d%27honneur">cour d'honneur</a> ("see key 1"). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the <a href="onion%20dome">onion-domed</a> chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and <a href="servants%27%20quarters">servants' quarters</a> ("see keys 2, 1 and 13"). The only decoration comes from the simple classical <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s above the windows. This façade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face with one of the most architecturally severe elevations of the palace ("see illustration right").

Oliveira was directly responsible for the "Ceremonial Façade" of the "corps de logis", the rectangular block which forms the nucleus of the palace, and some of the interior courtyards. His former tutor, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Robillon, was in charge of the gardens, many buildings, and the Rococo interiors. He in turn was assisted by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Pillement">Jean-Baptiste Pillement</a> and other French and Portuguese artists. The "Ceremonial Façade" is the best-known view of the palace. With classical proportions, it is externally decorated by <a href="travertine">travertine</a> rendering and delicately carved <a href="Cartouche%20%28design%29">cartouche</a>s over the windows. It has been described as a "harmonious example of Portuguese Baroque". This façade with its single-storey flanking wings forms a three-sided courtyard containing the "Hanging Garden"—so called because like the <a href="Hanging%20Gardens%20of%20Babylon">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a> it is on a raised terrace ("see key 5").

The second major part of the palace is the great western wing, known as the Robillon wing or Robillon Pavilion, which illustrates better than any other the excesses of Baroque and Rococo architecture ("see key 9"). Completed in 1779, it has a <a href="Doric%20order">doric</a> <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> which runs the entire length of its western and southern façades, the roof of which provides a balustraded balcony accessible from the floor above ("see key 10"). Owing to the topography of the site, the eastern side appears as a single-storey building, with only the upper floor visible above the ground in the "Hanging Garden". The balustrade on the roof of the Robillon wing is broken by heavy segmental <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s adorned with reclining statuary figures; the balustrade itself is also adorned with <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Aflambeau">flambeau</a>x, statuary and heavy <a href="armorial">armorial</a> <a href="Trophy%20%28architectural%29">trophies</a> ("see illustration below").

The Robillon wing contains an entrance to the palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight so as not to lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary ("see key 11"). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s in natural stone ("see illustration").

In 1760, Pombal arranged for Dom Pedro to marry the king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple to live with their children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.

By the death of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the interior work was completed. This was fortunate, as from this period his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">João VI</a>, was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.

In 2004, the <a href="World%20Monuments%20Fund">World Monuments Fund</a> began a program to restore the lead sculptures by British sculptor <a href="John%20Cheere">John Cheere</a>, as well as some of the other features of the garden. The project is ongoing.

The interior of the palace received no less attention to detail and design than the exterior. French <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s were employed to decorate the rooms, many of which are small, their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and historical scenes. Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors, for a <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Arustic">rustic</a> appearance as well as coolness in hot weather. The many tall pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms. A predominant feature of the interiors is the <a href="azulejo">azulejo</a>s: <a href="polychrome">polychrome</a> glazed tiles, often in a <a href="chinoiserie">chinoiserie</a> style with tones of blues and yellows contrasting with muted reds. Materials for use on the interior included stone imported from <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> and woods from Brazil, Denmark and Sweden, while coloured marbles were imported from Italy. Many of the palace's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934, and much was lost.

The Sala das Mangas (the only room in the state apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels ("illustrated below"). The gallery leads to the enfilade of <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s, all of which have been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed <a href="Drawing%20room">salon</a> painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.

The Music Room ("illustrated below") which follows the "Sala dos Embaixadores" is decorated with gilded and painted wood and was redesigned in 1768. The is notable for the intricate ribbed scheme of its design, similar to that of the vestibule at <a href="Caserta%20Palace">Caserta</a>. The Music Room is decorated in a more neoclassical style than the other state rooms, reflecting its redesign in the period following the Baroque Rococo in the final half of the 18th century. This room was the setting for the large concerts for which the palace was famous. The room still contains the <a href="Empire%20%28style%29">Empire</a> grand piano decorated with gilt appliques. Above the piano hangs a . Like many other rooms of the palace, the Music Room is lit by huge crystal chandeliers.

The Ballroom, the last of the palace's three largest rooms, ("illustrated below") was designed by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The <a href="ormolu">ormolu</a> Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Cuvilli%C3%A9s">François de Cuvilliés</a>' <a href="Amalienburg">Amalienburg</a> at <a href="Schloss%20Nymphenburg">Schloss Nymphenburg</a>. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden <a href="caryatid">caryatid</a>s.

The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), sometimes called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 and is one of the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt <a href="console%20table">console table</a> above which are <a href="pier%20glass">pier glass</a>es adorned with crystal <a href="Sconce%20%28light%20fixture%29">sconce</a>s. The throne <a href="dais">dais</a>, set in an <a href="apse">apse</a>, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a <a href="Checkerboard">chequer board</a> pattern of black and white marble tiles.

During the occupancy of the palace by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was no coincidence that the chapel was the first part of the palace to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in 1816.

The chapel beneath its large <a href="onion%20dome">onion dome</a> is dark and cavernous and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor <a href="Silvestre%20Faria%20Lobo">Silvestre Faria Lobo</a>. The upper level has galleries for the use of royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a>. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable <a href="baptismal%20font">font</a>, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.

The private rooms of the palace are far smaller and more intimate than the formal state rooms and contain many which belonged to the rooms' former occupants. Amongst the more remarkable rooms in this suite are the Sala das Merendas, the Queen's Boudoir and the King's Bedroom.

This was the royal family's private dining room. The decoration continues the theme used in some of the more formal and public rooms, with tiled panels illustrating <a href="Pastoral">courtiers in sylvan poses</a>. These panels, like much other work in the palace, were produced by <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Valentim">João Valentim</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Conrado%20Rosa">José Conrado Rosa</a>.

This was one of the private rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is designed in the form of a <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Abower">bower</a>, with a <a href="Trellis%20%28agriculture%29">trellis</a> pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor ("illustrated below"), giving the impression of being in a <a href="pergola">pergola</a> rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by <a href="William%20Thomas%20Beckford">William Beckford</a>, who visited the palace in 1794.

The King's Bedroom ("illustrated below") has been described as one of the most "fantastic" rooms in the palace. Although actually square, it gives the illusion of being completely circular, with a domed ceiling supported by columns of mirrored glass. Between the columns are <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a>s depicting scenes from the tales of <a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>. Peter the IV died in this room in 1834, same room where he was born in 1798. The room contains a large bust of the King showing his "pendulous jowls and unattractive face".

Queluz is famed for the glory of its gardens, which include a large <a href="topiary">topiary</a> <a href="parterre">parterre</a> laid out in the manner of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Le%20N%C3%B4tre">Le Nôtre</a> at the rear of the palace ("see key 14"). The Flemish influences, including the canals, in the garden are the work of the Dutch gardener <a href="Gerald%20van%20der%20Kolk">Gerald van der Kolk</a>, who assisted Robillon from 1760. Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and fountains. The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the "Portico dos Cavalinhos", a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues depicting <a href="Pheme">Fame</a>s, and two <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a>es ("see final illustration") surreally dressed in 18th-century costume, combining the formal and the fantastic. This surreal theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the <a href="rape%20of%20the%20Sabines">rape of the Sabines</a> and the death of <a href="Abel">Abel</a> alternate with statuary of <a href="donkey">donkey</a>s dressed in human clothing. Deeper in the gardens is a <a href="grotto">grotto</a> complete with a cascade. Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens, the Queluz cascade was the first <a href="artificial%20waterfall">artificial waterfall</a> to be constructed near Lisbon.

An avenue of huge <a href="magnolia">magnolia</a>s forms the approach to the classical Robillon wing of the palace ("see key 7"), while from the wing a . More than 100 metres (330 ft) long, the are decorated with tiled panels depicting <a href="seascapes">seascapes</a> and associated scenes. This is the largest of a series of canals in the gardens bordered with <a href="chinoiserie">chinoiserie</a>-style <a href="azulejo">azulejo</a> tiles. Fed by a stream, the sluice gates to the canals are only opened in May. During the 18th century, the canals were the setting for <a href="f%C3%AAte%20champ%C3%AAtre">fêtes champêtres</a> during which fully rigged ships would sail in processions with figures aboard in allegorical costumes.

The gardens also contain a which has been attributed to <a href="Bernini">Bernini</a>. There are further fountains and statuary in the lower gardens, including an important collection of statues by the British sculptor John Cheere (1709–1787). These gardens are set within tall hedges of <a href="Taxus%20baccata">yew</a> and <a href="cypress">cypress</a>, and magnolia and mulberry trees planted by <a href="Jean-Andoche%20Junot">Marshal Junot</a> during the French occupation in the Napoleonic wars.

Following a fire at the <a href="Ajuda%20National%20Palace">Ajuda Palace</a> in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife <a href="Charlotte%20of%20Spain">Carlotta Joaquina</a> began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon I</a> in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and <a href="Transfer%20of%20the%20Portuguese%20Court%20to%20Brazil">fled to Brazil</a>. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, <a href="Jean-Andoche%20Junot">General Junot</a>, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt <a href="Infanta%20Benedita%20of%20Portugal">Princess Maria Francisca Benedita</a>. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.

Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which <a href="William%20Thomas%20Beckford">William Beckford</a> described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.

Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son <a href="Miguel%20of%20Portugal">King Miguel</a> used the palace during the three-year <a href="Liberal%20Wars">civil war</a> which he fought against his brother King <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Pedro IV</a>, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II</a> ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son <a href="Pedro%20V%20of%20Portugal">Pedro V</a>. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20I%20of%20Portugal">Luís</a>. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the <a href="Lisbon%20regicide">assassination</a> of Luís' son <a href="Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal">Carlos I</a> in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the <a href="5%20October%201910%20revolution">monarchy fell two years later</a>.

In the 21st century, the palace gardens, once an <a href="irrigation">irrigated</a> oasis in the centre of parched farmland, are bounded by the ""Radial de Sintra"" motorway which feeds traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra. However, transportation and tourism have been the saviours of the palace. Since 1940 it has been open to the public as a museum. It houses much of the former royal collection, including furniture, <a href="Arraiolos">Arraiolos</a> carpets, paintings, and Chinese and European <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s and <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>.

In 1957, the "Dona Maria Pavilion" in the palace's east wing was transformed into a guest house for visiting heads of state. Today the palace's principal rooms are therefore not simply museums, but the setting for official entertaining.

The town square that the palace faces, ""Largo do Palácio de Queluz"", remains relatively unaltered since the 18th century. The large houses, once the homes of <a href="courtier">courtier</a>s, and the <a href="Pousada%20de%20Dona%20Maria%2C%20Queluz">former Royal Guard quarters</a> with its <a href="campanile">campanile</a> are still clustered around the palace. In latter years, the town of Queluz has expanded considerably to become one of the suburbs of Lisbon. The Palace of Queluz is one of Lisbon's many tourist attractions.

Harriet Arbuthnot

Harriet Arbuthnot (10 September 1793 – 2 August 1834) was an early 19th-century English diarist, social observer and political hostess on behalf of the <a href="Tory">Tory</a> party. During the 1820s she was the ""closest woman friend"" of the hero of <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">1st Duke of Wellington</a>. She maintained a long correspondence and association with the Duke, all of which she recorded in her diaries, which are consequently extensively used in all authoritative biographies of the Duke of Wellington.

Born into the periphery of the <a href="British%20Honours%20System%23Hereditary%20peerage">British aristocracy</a> and married to a politician and member of the establishment, she was perfectly placed to meet all the key figures of the <a href="English%20Regency">Regency</a> and late <a href="Napoleonic%20era">Napoleonic</a> eras. Recording meetings and conversations often verbatim, she has today become the ""Mrs. Arbuthnot"" quoted in many biographies and histories of the era. Her observations and memories of life within the British establishment are not confined to individuals but document politics, great events and daily life with an equal attention to detail, providing historians with a clear picture of the events described. Her diaries were themselves finally published in 1950 as "The Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot".

Harriet Arbuthnot was born Harriet Fane on 10 September 1793, the daughter of the <a href="Henry%20Fane%2C%20MP">Hon. Henry Fane</a>, second son of <a href="Thomas%20Fane%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Thomas Fane</a>, 8th <a href="Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Earl of Westmorland</a>. As a young man, Henry Fane had been described as "very idle and careless and spending much time in the country". However, he found time to be the Member of Parliament for <a href="Lyme%20Regis%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Lyme</a> and in 1772 was appointed Keeper of the King's Private Roads. In 1778, he married Arbuthnot's mother, Anne Batson, an heiress, the daughter of Edward Buckley Batson. The couple had 14 children: nine sons and five daughters.

The young Harriet spent much of her childhood at the family home at <a href="Fulbeck">Fulbeck Hall</a> in Lincolnshire, sited high on the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> hills above <a href="Grantham">Grantham</a>. The house, which had been given to Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane. At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable and reasonably affluent rural childhood.

Harriet Fane's father died when she was nine years old, but the family fortunes improved considerably in 1810 when her mother inherited the <a href="Avon%20Tyrrell">Avon Tyrrell</a> estate in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and the Upwood Estate in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. This yielded the widowed Mrs Fane an income of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>6,000 per annum (£ per year as of 2019), a large income by the standards of the day. With 14 children and a position in society to maintain, however, the money was fully utilised.
Harriet Fane married Rt Hon <a href="Charles%20Arbuthnot">Charles Arbuthnot</a>, member of <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>, at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814. Born in 1767, her husband was 26 years older than she was, an age difference which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage. Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at <a href="Child%27s%20Bank">Child's Bank</a>. It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to <a href="Settlement%20%28trust%29">settle</a> enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: "How can you and I live upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [her mother] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever?"

Charles Arbuthnot was a widower with four children; his son <a href="Charles%20George%20James%20Arbuthnot">Charles</a> was a mere nine years junior to his new wife. His first wife Marcia, a <a href="lady%20in%20waiting">lady in waiting</a> to the notorious <a href="Caroline%20of%20Brunswick">Princess of Wales</a>, had died in 1806. Like the other two men his second wife so admired, <a href="Robert%20Stewart%2C%20Viscount%20Castlereagh">Viscount Castlereagh</a> and Wellington, Charles Arbuthnot was a member of the <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. He had been a member of parliament since 1795, when he became the member for <a href="East%20Looe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">East Looe</a>. At the time of his marriage to Fane, he was the member for <a href="St%20Germans%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">St Germans</a>. He had briefly interrupted his political career to become <a href="Ambassador%20Extraordinary">Ambassador Extraordinary</a> to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> between 1804 and 1807. Marriage to such a pillar of the establishment as Charles Arbuthnot opened all doors to his young new wife, who, as one of the 14 children of a younger son of an aristocratic family possessed of no great fortune, would otherwise have been on the periphery of the highest society. However, as the debate and wrangling over her <a href="dowry">dowry</a> proved, money was tight.

Throughout her marriage, Mrs Arbuthnot, the former Harriet Fane, formed close friendships with powerful older men. She described Castlereagh as her "dearest and best friend" until his death in 1822, when she transferred her affections to the other great 19th-century Anglo-Irish peer, the Duke of Wellington. All social commentators of the time, however, agree that her marriage was happy; indeed, her husband was as close a friend of Wellington's as was his wife. Married to a politician, she was fascinated by politics and enjoyed success as a political hostess while exerting her energies to promote <a href="Tory">Tory</a> causes. However, while she was the dominant partner, her conservative outlook ensured her continued favour among her elderly Tory admirers. During the early part of her marriage, her husband served as an <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20Treasury">Under-Secretary at the Treasury</a>. Later, in 1823, he was given the <a href="First%20Commissioner%20of%20Woods%20and%20Forests">Department of Woods and Forests</a>, a position which gave him charge of the <a href="Royal%20Parks">Royal parks and gardens</a>. The subsequent access to the <a href="British%20Royal%20family">Royal family</a> this allowed increased not only his status but also that of his wife.

When remarking in her diaries on other women who shared their affections with great men of the day, Arbuthnot displayed a sharp, ironic wit. Of Wellington's one-time <a href="mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a> Princess <a href="Dorothea%20Lieven">Dorothea Lieven</a>, wife to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Imperial Russian</a> ambassador to London from 1812 to 1834, she wrote "It is curious that the loves and intrigues of a femme galante should have such influence over the affairs of Europe." Arbuthnot obviously failed to realise she was regarded by some in London society as a "<a href="femme%20galante">femme galante</a>" in a similar situation herself.

Her political observations are clearly written from her own Tory viewpoint. However, her detailed description of the rivalry for power between the Tories and <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberals</a> which took place between 1822 and 1830 is one of the most authoritative accounts of this struggle.

It is likely that Arbuthnot first came to the attention of Wellington during 1814 in the re-opened <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>s of Paris following the exile of <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> to <a href="Elba">Elba</a>. Wellington had been appointed the <a href="List%20of%20Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20France">British Ambassador</a> to the <a href="Tuileries">Court of the Tuileries</a>, and the city was crowded with English visitors anxious to travel on the continent and socialise after the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.

Amongst those sampling the rounds of entertainment in this lively environment were the newly married Arbuthnots. Charles Arbuthnot was known to Wellington, as he had been a strong supporter of Wellington's younger brother <a href="Henry%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Cowley">Henry</a> during his divorce, and it is possible Wellington had met, or at least heard of, Mrs Arbuthnot—she was a first cousin to his favourites the Burghersh family. However, it was only after the death of Castlereagh in 1822 that the Wellington–Arbuthnot friendship blossomed. It is unlikely any close friendship developed before this time. Wellington, ensconced in the <a href="Hotel%20de%20Charost">Hotel de Charost</a> (recently vacated by Napoleon's sister Princess <a href="Pauline%20Bonaparte">Pauline Borghese</a>) and <a href="f%C3%AAte">fête</a>d by the whole of <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Restoration</a> Paris, had already found himself a close female companion, <a href="Giuseppina%20Grassini">Giuseppina Grassini</a>. This woman, known, due to her close friendship with Napoleon as ""La Chanteuse de l'Empereur"", scandalised Parisian society both English and French by appearing on Wellington's arm, especially after the arrival in Paris of the <a href="Catherine%20Wellesley%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Wellington">Duchess of Wellington</a>.

The story of a "<a href="m%C3%A9nage%20%C3%A0%20trois">ménage à trois</a>" between Mrs Arbuthnot, her husband Charles, and Wellington, widely speculated upon, has been rejected by some biographers. However, it has been said that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company "the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him." Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke's confidante in all matters, especially that of his marriage. He confided to her that he only married his wife because "they asked me to do it" and that he was "not the least in love with her." In fact, Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day. Following the marriage, the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common. Despite producing two sons, they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831. Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess ("she is such a fool"), although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort: in Harriet's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy, but had no idea how to go about the task.

As a consequence of his unsatisfactory marriage, Wellington formed relationships with other women, but it was for Arbuthnot that "he reserved his deepest affection." Her husband at this time was working at The Treasury and Arbuthnot in effect became what would today be termed Wellington's <a href="social%20secretary">social secretary</a> during his first term of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">premiership</a> between January 1828 and November 1830. It has been suggested that the Duke of Wellington allowed her "almost unrestricted access to the secrets of the cabinet". Whatever her knowledge and access, however, it appears she was unable to influence the Duke, but even his refusal to bring her husband into the Cabinet in January 1828 failed to shake the intimacy of the trio.

Wellington made no attempts to conceal his friendship with Arbuthnot. An indication that their relationship was <a href="Platonic%20love">platonic</a> and accepted as such in the highest echelons of society can be drawn from the <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Duchess of Kent</a> permitting Wellington to present Arbuthnot to her infant daughter, the future <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, in 1828. Arbuthnot noted that the young princess was "the most charming child I ever saw" and that "the Duchess of Kent is a very sensible person, who educates her (Victoria) remarkably well." Arbuthnot's impressions of the Duchess were less than candid, and not shared by Wellington and other establishment figures. However, had Arbuthnot's own character not been judged respectable an audience with the infant princess would not have been permitted.

Many references in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and a visit to <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington's fellow duke the <a href="George%20Spencer-Churchill%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">5th Duke of Marlborough</a>, of whom she wrote: "The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have chosen this moment to resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler".

When Wellington and the Tories fell from power in November 1830, Arbuthnot lost interest in her diary, writing: "I shall write very seldom now, I dare say, in my book, for, except the Duke, none of the public men interest me." Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of <a href="Henry%20Hobhouse%20%28archivist%29">Henry Hobhouse</a>.

Arbuthnot died suddenly of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> on 2 August 1834 at Woodford Lodge, her home near the Arbuthnots' seat, <a href="Woodford%2C%20Northamptonshire">Woodford House</a>, Northamptonshire. Immediately after her death an express message was sent to <a href="Apsley%20House">Apsley House</a>. The messenger, however, had to divert to <a href="Hatfield%20House">Hatfield House</a> where Wellington was dining with the <a href="James%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Marquess and Marchioness of Salisbury</a>. After her death, it was revealed she had been on a <a href="civil%20list">civil list</a> pension of £936 per annum (£ per year as of 2019) since January 1823.

The exact nature of Arbuthnot's relationship with Wellington has always been a subject for conjecture. Fuel was added to the speculations when Wellington was immediately pursued by female admirers following her death. One was a Miss Jenkins who, from the moment of Arbuthnot's death, pursued him "body and soul." Another, who resurfaced from his past, was Arbuthnot's own cousin, the eccentric Lady <a href="Brympton%20d%27Evercy%23The%20Fane%20family">Georgiana Fane</a>, who constantly pestered Wellington with threats to publish intimate letters he had once sent her, and to sue him for, allegedly, reneging on a promise to marry her. It seems most likely that in addition to assisting Wellington with his social life, Harriet's presence at his side protected him from the advances of other women. The Duke certainly kept <a href="Mistress%20%28lover%29">mistresses</a> during the period he knew Arbuthnot, but it has never been proven that Harriet was one of them. The tour at <a href="Apsley%20House">Apsley House</a>, the Duke's London residence, asserts that she merely served as his hostess at political dinners.

After her death, Charles left Woodford House and lived with his close friend Wellington. Charles died at Apsley House in 1850, aged 83. During their time together the two elderly men mourned the loss of Arbuthnot and bemoaned the splits developing within the Tory party. Wellington lived on for another two years and was buried with due pomp and circumstance in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. Harriet Arbuthnot had been buried with the Fane family at <a href="St%20Nicholas%27%20Church%2C%20Fulbeck">St Nicholas'</a> parish church, <a href="Fulbeck">Fulbeck</a>.

Raymond Leane

<a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28Australia%29">Brigadier General</a> Sir Raymond Lionel Leane, (12 July 1878 – 25 June 1962) was an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officer who rose to command the <a href="48th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">48th Battalion</a> then <a href="12th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">12th Brigade</a> during World War I. For his performance during the war, Leane was described by the Australian Official War Historian, <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, as "the foremost fighting leader" in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF), and "the head of the most famous family of soldiers in Australian history", among other accolades. After the war, he served as Commissioner of the <a href="South%20Australia%20Police">South Australia Police</a> from 1920 to 1944, for which he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a>.

A businessman and part-time <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Forces</a> officer before the war, Leane was commissioned into the AIF and led a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of the <a href="11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">11th Infantry Battalion</a> at the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April 1915. He rose to temporarily command his battalion, and was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO), awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> and wounded three times during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. After returning to Egypt, the AIF was re-organised, and Leane was appointed as the commanding officer of the newly formed 48th Battalion, which soon after was transported to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France and Belgium. Important battles that the 48th were involved in under his command included the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a> in 1916, and the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bullecourt">First Battle of Bullecourt</a> and <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">First Battle of Passchendaele</a> in 1917. During the latter battle, he was severely wounded. During 1916–1917, he was mentioned in despatches three more times, was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> and awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DSO.

After recuperating, in early 1918 he returned to his battalion and led it during the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> of March and April 1918, which included heavy fighting near <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a>, for which he was again mentioned in despatches. As a battalion commander, he proved a difficult subordinate, disobeying the orders of his brigade commanders at both Pozières and Dernancourt. In June 1918 he was promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a> and temporary brigadier general to command the 12th Brigade, which he led during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> in August, and the fighting to capture the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Outpost Line</a> in September. He was mentioned in despatches a further two times after the conclusion of the war, and in early 1919 was also awarded the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a>, and made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> for his "gallant and able" leadership while commanding the 12th Brigade. During the war, four of his brothers and six of his nephews served, with two of his brothers and two of his nephews being killed.

After helping oversee the repatriation of soldiers back to Australia, Leane returned home to South Australia in late 1919. In May the following year he was selected as the next Commissioner of the South Australia Police, taking up the appointment in July. His appointment was initially controversial within the force, as there had been an established practice of selecting the commissioner from within its ranks. Leane also returned to part-time soldiering, commanding at the brigade level until 1926, not without controversy. His administration of the police force was generally praised, although he did have to weather several storms, one of which involved a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> into bribery of some of his officers by <a href="bookmaker%20%28gambling%29">bookmakers</a>. He was a foundation member and inaugural president of the <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Club of Adelaide</a>, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. In 1928, during a major dispute over the <a href="industrial%20award">industrial award</a> applying to waterfront labourers, Leane provided police protection to non-<a href="trade%20union">union</a> workers, and on one occasion personally led a force of 150 police that successfully confronted a crowd of 2,000 waterside labourers who wanted to remove non-union workers from Adelaide ports. As commissioner, he introduced a number of innovations, including cadets and probationary training for young recruits, police dogs, and traffic accident analysis. After the outbreak of World War II, despite being on the retired list, Leane became the state commander of the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League</a>-organised <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a>, a form of home guard, in addition to his duties as commissioner. After retiring in 1944, he was knighted for his services during 24 years at the head of the police force. In retirement he became involved in conservative politics, and remained active with returned servicemen's associations until his death in 1962.

Raymond Lionel Leane was born on 12 July 1878 in <a href="Prospect%2C%20South%20Australia">Prospect, South Australia</a>, the son of a <a href="Shoemaking">shoemaker</a>, Thomas John Leane, and his wife Alice Short, who were of <a href="Cornish%20people">Cornish</a> descent. One of eight children, he was educated at North Adelaide Public School until age 12, when he went to work for a retail and wholesale business, which sent him to <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>. He later moved to <a href="Claremont%2C%20Western%20Australia">Claremont</a>. In June 1902, Leane married Edith Louise Laybourne, a sister of the architect <a href="Louis%20Laybourne%20Smith">Louis Laybourne Smith</a>. He and Edith lived at Claremont for six years, during which he served on the <a href="Town%20of%20Claremont">local council</a> from 1903 to 1906. His interest in the military led to Leane being <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the 11th (Perth Rifles) Infantry Regiment, a unit of the part-time <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Forces</a> in 1905. In 1908, he bought a retail business in <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a> and transferred to the Goldfields Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> on 21 November 1910.

On 25 August 1914, Leane joined the newly formed <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) as a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> commander in the Western Australia-raised <a href="11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">11th Infantry Battalion</a> of the <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>, with the rank of captain. The AIF was established as Australia's <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> to fight in the war, as the Citizen Forces were restricted to home defence per the "Defence Act 1903". When the battalion was formed, he was appointed to command F Company. The <a href="battalion">battalion</a> embarked for overseas in October and sailed to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, the unit was re-organised into four companies to mirror the <a href="British%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20I">British Army</a> battalion structure, and a new C Company was created by combining E and F Companies. Leane was chosen to command the new C Company.

After several months training in Egypt, the 3rd Brigade first saw action as the <a href="covering%20force">covering force</a> for the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April 1915 and so was the first brigade ashore about 04:30. Leane's C Company was in the first wave, and landed just to the north of the <a href="Ari%20Burnu">Ari Burnu</a> headland then climbed it to Plugge's Plateau. By noon on 30 April, the 1,000-strong 11th Battalion had suffered casualties amounting to nine officers and 369 men. Four days later, Leane was chosen to lead an amphibious assault on <a href="Gaba%20Tepe">Gaba Tepe</a>, a prominent headland south of the Anzac perimeter on which an <a href="Ottoman%20Army%20%281861%E2%80%931922%29">Ottoman</a>-held fort was situated. The troops occupying the fort were directing <a href="artillery">artillery</a> fire onto the positions around Anzac Cove. Landing from boats on the beach at the foot of Gaba Tepe, the force consisted of over 110 men from the 11th Battalion and 3rd Field Company. The force was promptly pinned down on the beach by heavy fire. Leane signalled the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to remove his wounded from the beach, which they did with a steamboat towing a rowboat. Having determined that the withdrawal along the beach was impossible owing to belts of <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>, Leane then signalled the Royal Navy to remove the rest of his party. The Navy sent two <a href="picket%20boat">picket boat</a>s towing two <a href="ship%27s%20boat">ships' boat</a>s. <a href="Destroyer">Destroyer</a>s laid down covering fire, but while the Ottomans had held their fire for the evacuation of the wounded, they laid down tremendous fire on the withdrawing raiders. Many men were hit, including Leane, who was wounded in the hand. The raid was a failure, but Leane's leadership, courage and coolness under fire had impressed, and he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> (MC) for his actions. The recommendation from his <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> read: 

Following the raid on Gaba Tepe, Leane rejoined his battalion in the main defensive line around the beachhead. Before dawn on 19 May, elements of the Ottoman 16th Division attacked the 3rd Brigade positions on Bolton's Ridge as part of a wider <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> against the Anzac sector. During the fighting, Leane was located in a forward <a href="Sapping">sap</a> of the battalion trenches overlooking a gully where the Ottoman troops were congregating. From this position, Leane and two other 11th Battalion men killed a large number of Ottoman troops with their rifles, firing from dawn until noon. On 28 June, Leane's company went forward of Bolton's Ridge towards Turkey Knoll to provide covering fire for an abortive attack by the <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th Battalion</a> on Ottoman trenches on Sniper's Ridge. This attack was a <a href="feint">feint</a>, intended to distract the Ottoman commanders from reinforcing their troops opposite an Allied attack at <a href="Cape%20Helles">Cape Helles</a> far to the south. The forward company position was completely untenable, the lead elements of Leane's company were raked by <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">shrapnel</a> and <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> fire, and Leane was wounded in the face. Despite this, he remained with his unit. The two companies of the 11th Battalion that were committed to support the attack lost 21 killed and 42 wounded.

During the night of 31 July, Leane led an assault on an Ottoman trench opposite Tasmania Post, which was held by the 11th Battalion. The attack was prompted by a desire to give the Ottomans the impression that an attempt was going to be made to break out of the Anzac perimeter to the south, while a landing was planned at <a href="Suvla%20Bay">Suvla Bay</a> far to the north. Leane's force consisted of four parties of 50 men, who were to assault the Ottoman trench after the firing of four <a href="Explosive%20mine">mines</a> that had been dug up to the enemy trench. Initially only the northernmost and southernmost of the mines exploded, but Leane led out the attack regardless. While the parties were covering the distance between Tasmania Post and the Ottoman trench, a third mine exploded, possibly burying some members of one of the assaulting groups. The fourth mine failed to explode. Stiff fighting occurred at some points of the objective trench, but the Ottomans were routed and the trench was consolidated and communication trenches leading towards the Ottoman rear were barricaded. Several desperate <a href="hand%20grenade">bomb</a> fights occurred at the barricades. Work immediately began to convert the mine tunnels into communication trenches leading to the newly captured trench. There were some feeble counterattacks. At dawn, Ottoman artillery began an intense bombardment of the newly-won position. During the shelling, Leane was speaking to an observer as an enemy shell landed. The observer was decapitated and Leane was wounded in the head, but remained at his post. The position captured during this operation became known as "Leane's Trench". While capturing the trench, the 11th Battalion had lost 36 killed and 73 wounded.

Leane was promoted to temporary <a href="major">major</a> on 5 August while recuperating in hospital on the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>. He rejoined his unit four days later and was recommended to be made a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO), the second highest award for acts of gallantry by officers, for his "great gallantry, coolness and dash". He temporarily commanded the 11th Infantry Battalion from 30 September, and was promoted to substantive major and temporary <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 8 October. Leane remained at Gallipoli until the battalion was evacuated to Lemnos on 16 November. He was admitted to hospital with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in late November, and was evacuated to Egypt, finally being discharged in early February 1916. For his service during the campaign, in addition to his MC and DSO, he was twice <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>. He also became known by the nickname "The Bull". As the Official Australian War Historian <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a> observed, his "tall square-shouldered frame, immense jaw, tightly compressed lips, and keen, steady, humorous eyes made him the very figure of a soldier".

On discharge from hospital, Leane initially returned to the 11th Battalion, but on 21 February 1916 was transferred to be the commanding officer of the planned <a href="48th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">48th Infantry Battalion</a>. The 48th Battalion was assigned to the <a href="12th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">12th Brigade</a>, part of the <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">4th Division</a>. Leane was substantively promoted to lieutenant colonel on 12 March, and the battalion itself was raised four days later. Like Leane himself, the 48th was both South Australian and Western Australian, having been raised from a <a href="cadre%20%28military%29">cadre</a> drawn from the <a href="16th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">16th Battalion</a> reinforced by fresh recruits from Australia. Serving in the battalion were a number of Leane's relatives, including his younger brother, Benjamin Bennett Leane, who was initially his adjutant and later his second-in-command. There were also three of his nephews in the battalion (Allan Edwin, Reuben Ernest and Geoffrey Paul Leane), and several other relatives. The 48th became known throughout the AIF as the "<a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> Battalion" because it was "made of All-Leanes" (Maid of Orleans). Throughout March and April 1916, the battalion undertook training in the desert before being moved to Habieta in early May where they briefly manned defensive positions as a precaution against a possible Ottoman attack on the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. On 1 June, after a preliminary march to Serapeum, the battalion was moved by rail to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and boarded the troopship "Caledonia", which sailed for France two days later. They docked at <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> on 9 June, after which they were moved to northern France by rail.

After the battalion moved to France, its first serious fighting was during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a> on the night of 5/6 August, when it was committed to defend ground captured by the Australian <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a>. On receiving his orders, Leane immediately reconnoitred the position with his company commanders, during which they were pinned down by a German barrage and two of them were wounded. His brigade commander, <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Duncan%20Glasfurd">Duncan Glasfurd</a> and his superior commanders believed that a strong German <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> would follow the tremendous barrage then falling on the Australian-held positions. Glasfurd therefore ordered Leane to place two companies north of Pozières, but Leane was convinced that this would overcrowd the area and result in needless casualties. His plan was to garrison his two trenches with one company each and hold his two reserve companies well to the rear of the village and he confronted Glasfurd and demanded written orders. Glasfurd then gave Leane a written order that his two reserve companies were to be sent forward, but Leane remained defiant, stationing only one company north of Pozières. According to Bean, while disobedience of orders is a dangerous practice in general, in this case later events proved that Leane was fully justified in this action. According to the historian Craig Deayton, Leane was already the dominant influence in the brigade, and was proving to be a "difficult subordinate" for Glasfurd. Leane was not alone in his approach, as the commanding officer of the flanking <a href="14th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">14th Battalion</a>, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dare, adopted the same disposition and disobeyed his own brigade commander in doing so. Leane later described the relief of the previous garrison as the worst he experienced in the whole war, conducted as it was under a tremendous German bombardment. When he visited his front lines in the early morning, he found remnants of his two companies, scattered among shell holes rather than trenches, and surrounded by dead and wounded.

By mid-afternoon on 6 August, it was apparent from the continuing heavy shelling that a German counterattack was to be expected. The two front line companies had suffered heavy losses, and, according to Bean, Leane's decision to retain a company in the rear of the village was shown to be a wise one. That evening he relieved his two forward companies with the reserve company, leaving the other company north of the village. About 04:00 on 7 August a full scale German counterattack developed, which threatened to overrun the 48th Battalion. Leane committed half of his remaining company, and this helped to resolve the situation. Leane's battalion was relieved in the afternoon. Leane's refusal to follow Glasfurd's orders has been described as flowing from "conspicuous common sense and great moral courage", but Deayton observes that the fact that no inquiry was undertaken after the battle was a failing by Leane's chain of command, which effectively gave Leane licence to disobey orders in future. The relationship between Glasfurd and Leane did not recover from this clash. Deayton further observes that if the German assault had been launched a day earlier, and the forward trenches lost, even temporarily, Leane would likely have been brought to account for his disobedience. In just one day and two nights of battle, the 48th Battalion lost 20 officers and 578 men, mainly from shell fire. The battalion returned to the line at Pozières on 12–15 August, losing another 89 casualties. Following this, the battalion undertook a defensive role around <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Mouquet Farm</a>, before being moved to <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> where they rotated with the other three battalions of the 12th Brigade to man a sector of the line south of <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a>. No major attacks occurred in their sector during this time, and although there were a few casualties, the battalion was able to replace some of its losses, reaching a strength of around 700 men. Leane was again mentioned in despatches, this time for "consistent, thorough and good work in raising and training his battalion" and his command of his unit at Pozières and Mouquet Farm.

During the worst European winter in 40 years, the 48th Battalion continued to take its turn at the front line, and Leane was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time. In March 1917 his battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> of fortifications. In early April 1917, the 12th Brigade was committed to an <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29%23Flanking%20operations">attack aimed at capturing Bullecourt</a>, with the 48th Battalion given the task of capturing the secondary objective, following behind the <a href="46th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">46th Battalion</a>. During the preparations, due to a misunderstanding, Leane was ordered by his brigade commander to send 200 troops into the village of <a href="Bullecourt">Bullecourt</a>, which Leane believed to be well defended. Characteristically, Leane insisted that if the order must be carried out, it would involve the destruction of one of his companies, and he would have to choose that commanded by his nephew Allan. The timely arrival of a divisional staff officer clarified the situation, and the order was cancelled. On the morning of 10 April, the battalion was formed up for the attack when the promised <a href="tank">tank</a> support failed to arrive on time, and the assault was postponed. During the withdrawal back to the front line, Leane's brother, Major Benjamin Leanenow the second-in-command of the unitwas killed by shell fire, and the battalion suffered another 20 casualties. Leane found Ben's body among the dead, and carried him to a spot where he dug a grave before erecting a cross above it.

The postponed attack was rescheduled for the following day, and despite further problems with the tank support, the 48th Battalion was able to push through to the second line of German trenches in the Hindenburg Line east of Bullecourt. The position was considered to be secure if close artillery support was provided. But mistaken artillery and air observers insisted that they had seen Australian troops beyond the Hindenburg Line, messages from the forward battalions did not get back to their higher headquarters, and the artillery commanders would not bring down the protective barrage needed. Reinforcements were unable to get through in sufficient strength. When a large-scale German counterattack developed, the 48th Battalion was almost cut off in the captured German trenches, and had to fight their way out, taking heavy casualties in the process. Of the around 750 men of the battalion involved in the attack, the unit lost 15 officers and 421 men. Leane's nephew Allan, who had led the fight in the captured German trench, was captured after being wounded and later died in a German hospital. The Australian commanders were scathing of the tanks, blaming them almost entirely for the failure, with Leane even accusing the tank crews of "cowardice and incompetence".

The battalion was next involved in serious fighting during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>. Although in a supporting role for the brigade's initial advance on 7 June, its companies were soon committed to reinforce the leading battalions. They continued to fight the Germans until 10 June when they were withdrawn so that the battalion could be re-organised as a whole. Later the same day the battalion was recommitted to the front line. The following morning, with characteristic aggression, Leane pushed a strong fighting patrol forward at dawn, working on his assumption that the trenches and strong points opposite the battalion were only being held at night, with the German garrison being withdrawn during the day. He proved to be right, and the German positions were captured without a fight, along with two field guns and a large quantity of ammunition. This action secured the brigade objective and linked up the 12th Brigade with the <a href="13th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">13th Brigade</a> on its left. Up until the battalion was withdrawn from the battle on 12 June, it had lost 4 officers and 62 men. Leane was recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DSO after Messines for "clever handling" of his battalion, but he did not receive that award. The battalion rotated through rest, reserve positions and the front line until the <a href="Battle%20of%20Polygon%20Wood">Battle of Polygon Wood</a> in September. During this battle it was in a support role, engaged mainly in salvage in rear areas, but nevertheless suffered 27 casualties from heavy shell fire. Soon after, Leane was recommended to be made a <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> (CMG). The recommendation read: 

The battalion was next committed on the right flank of the main attack during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">First Battle of Passchendaele</a> on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the second counterattack pushed the 48th Battalion back to its start line. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. During the withdrawal, Leane was directing his unit from his headquarters near an old German <a href="Pillbox%20%28military%29">pillbox</a> when the area came under heavy German bombardment. A shell landed less than in front of him, Leane was severely wounded in the leg and hand, and was evacuated to England for treatment. He was again recommended for a bar to his DSO, this time successfully. The recommendation read: 

On 26 January 1918, Leane rejoined his battalion, having recuperated from his wounds. His CMG and bar to the DSO had been announced while he was away, as had his fifth mention in despatches. For almost the whole period of his absence, the 48th Battalion had been absorbing replacements, resting and training in rear areas, only returning to its rotation through to the front lines, reserve trenches and rest areas in mid-January. Even its brief periods in the front line had been quiet, mainly engaged in improving trenches and other defences. In mid-February the battalion moved to billets near <a href="Meteren">Meteren</a> where it remained until 25 March. On that day the 724-strong 48th Battalion was picked up by truck and sent south to help meet the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, which had only been launched four days earlier, meeting with resounding success. After debussing north of <a href="Berles-au-Bois">Berles-au-Bois</a>, the battalion marched into that village and took up positions. The following afternoon they were ordered to march through the night another further south to <a href="Senlis-le-Sec">Senlis-le-Sec</a>, arriving there on the morning of 27 March. After a brief stop they continued on through <a href="H%C3%A9nencourt">Hénencourt</a> and east to <a href="Millencourt">Millencourt</a>, due west of <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a>.

The 12th Brigade was initially placed under the command of the <a href="9th%20%28Scottish%29%20Division">9th (Scottish) Division</a>, responsible for holding the front line west of Albert, which had fallen into German hands. At this point, a breathless British staff officer appeared, stating that <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a> had fallen, and the Germans held the railway line in front of Albert. His orders were to guide the battalion into support positions on high ground behind the remnants of the 9th Division. Under Leane's stern gaze and questioning, he was unable to give the name of the commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General <a href="John%20Gellibrand">John Gellibrand</a>, who had apparently issued the orders, and due to rumours that alarms and false orders were being spread by Germans dressed as British staff officers, Leane detained him as a suspected spy. Leane went to find Gellibrand himself, found that the orders were correct, and the staff officer was released. After this delay in deployment, Leane directed his battalion east along the line of the Albert–<a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> road to the heights behind the 9th Division, which it reached in the early afternoon of 27 March.

Gellibrand then ordered the 48th Battalion, and the <a href="47th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">47th Battalion</a> on its right, to immediately take up positions on the forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was in full view of the approaching Germans. The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, "[b]ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only the latest in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.

After dark, the 48th Battalion took over the line from the remainder of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">V Corps</a>. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.

The 48th Battalion returned to its former positions on the railway embankment on the night of 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Ewen%20Sinclair-Maclagan">Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan</a> decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.

Leane himself, observing German trench-mortar fire, and suspecting that they were registering targets for a bombardment, ensured his battalion was ready for the impending battle, and sent out night patrols that detected large concentrations of German troops on a road only beyond the embankment. Gellibrand ordered Lewis gun teams to be sent out to open fire on the assembling Germans, and called down artillery on the S.O.S. lines forward of the embankment. He also brought the <a href="45th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">45th Battalion</a> up to dig in on the high ground near Leane's headquarters. At 07:00, a heavy German bombardment came down, at first on rear areas of the 4th Division and its flanking formations, extending to the front line and supports about 08:00. Leane later observed that the barrage was "the heaviest since Pozières". No attack immediately materialised on the 48th Battalion's front, although large parties of Germans began advancing after an hour of the barrage descending on the frontline. In stiff fighting, the Germans were repulsed on the 48th Battalion's front. Although Leane had twice been ordered to disband the battalion scout platoon under a new standard battalion structure brought into force in 1917, he had only recently done so, and only in a formal sense. Instead, whenever the battalion went into action, a similar number of designated scouts immediately reported to him, and he posted them at various locations to keep him informed of events.

About 10:30, some of Leane's scouts reported that the 13th Brigade, on the right of the 12th Brigade and opposite Dernancourt, was falling back. Around the same time, his right forward company on the embankment sent back a message indicating that the Germans had penetrated on the right of the brigade in the area of the 47th Battalion, and that it was taking over part of the left of the 47th Battalion line to assist. In response to a probe by the Germans against his northern-most company in the series of posts alongside the Albert–Amiens road, Leane immediately sent part of his reserve company from Pioneer Trench to reinforce it. Sensing the danger in the 13th Brigade area, Leane ordered Major <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur Samuel Allen</a>, commanding the nearby 45th Battalion, to move his battalion forward to vacant trenches overlooking that sector. As Allen was implementing these orders, he received conflicting orders from Gellibrand to send two companies forward to Pioneer Trench. Allen saw the wisdom of Leane's orders, and tried to convince the <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> that Leane's preferred course of action was best. Nevertheless, Allen was directed to carry out Gellibrand's orders. Later events proved that, being the most experienced commander on the ground, Leane actually had the most accurate conception of the real danger to the 12th Brigade's position.

At 12:15, with the 47th Battalion having given way to the German onslaught and withdrawing past them up towards the high ground, the two forward companies of the 48th on the embankment began to withdraw, leaving the northern-most company in its posts around the gully near the Albert–Amiens road. Soon after, the northern company was forced to withdraw its posts on the southern side of the gully. When he heard of the withdrawal, Leane sent forward his second-in-command to establish the line that the battalion would now attempt to hold. By 13:30, the 48th was still holding its left flanking posts near the Albert–Amiens road, but the rest of the battalion had withdrawn to Pioneer Trench on the high ground. The left flank posts were not withdrawn until about 15:30. At this point, a counterattack was ordered, involving the <a href="49th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">49th Battalion</a> of the 13th Brigade, which had been in reserve, with all but the far left flank of the 12th Brigade conforming with its advance. Sinclair-Maclagan wanted to use four available tanks to support the attack, but this was refused by the brigade commanders. Deayton surmises that this rejection of the tanks was at the urging of Leane, who had taken such a negative view of them at Bullecourt. Sinclair-Maclagan then argued that the objective of both brigades must be to retake the railway line, but this was opposed by Gellibrand, supported by Leane, whose opinion he still valued highly. They argued that the 12th Brigade should only aim to retake the former support line partway down the hill. Sinclair-Maclagan's view prevailed, possibly as he was acting in accordance with direction from higher headquarters. Despite this, Leane, as the commander of the forward troops of the 12th Brigade, once again displayed his strong independent streak, disobeying those orders and directing the troops' main effort towards recapturing the support trenches.

The resulting counterattack was described by Bean as "one of the finest ever carried out by Australian troops". The 49th Battalion, flanked on its left by a line consisting of two companies of the 45th, the remnants of the 47th, and finally the re-organised 48th, surged forward at 17:15 into very heavy small arms fire, but by nightfall had reached positions not far short of the old support line. The 49th had fought its way to a position almost identical to that which Leane had wanted the 45th to deploy earlier in the day, when his orders had conflicted with those of Gellibrand. The line established overnight was the only one that had really ever been defensible. The forward troops of the 12th Brigade were relieved overnight by the 46th Battalion, and on 7 April the whole brigade was relieved by the <a href="6th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">6th Brigade</a> of the 2nd Division. During the latter fighting for Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion had lost another 4 officers and 77 men.

After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion marched to the rear and began establishing a reserve line at <a href="Beaucourt">Beaucourt</a>. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted to the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a>. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a>, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two-minute barrage with all available guns at the time of the attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.

Leane returned to the 48th on 22 May and reverted in rank, but a little over a week later he was substantively promoted to colonel and temporarily promoted to brigadier general to command the 12th Brigade, as Gellibrand had been promoted to major general and appointed to command the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a>. For his "considerable skill and ability" while acting brigade commander, Leane was recommended for the award of the French <a href="Croix%20de%20Guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>, and was mentioned in despatches for the sixth time. Immediately before his assumption of command, the limited number of reinforcements available, combined with losses suffered by the 12th Brigade at Dernancourt and Monument Wood necessitated the disbandment of one of the battalions of the brigade, and the 47th Battalion was chosen. Between 25 and 27 May its manpower was divided equally between the other battalions of the brigade.

Leane then led his brigade during the highly successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> on 8 August, during which it spearheaded the 4th Division as it leapfrogged through the 3rd Division to capture the second and third objectives, suffering casualties of nine officers and 212 other ranks. The second objective was captured by the 45th and 46th Battalions, with the 48th Battalion capturing the third objective, along with 200 prisoners and 12 machine guns. The Battle of Amiens was later described by the German General <a href="Erich%20Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> as "the black day of the German Army".

After a rest in reserve positions, the 12th Brigade was then in the forefront of the <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%89pehy">attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line</a> on 18 September, with the 48th Battalion leading the assault in the first phase, followed by the 45th which captured the second objective. Despite opinions to the contrary, Leane realised that the third "exploitation" phase of the attack would not be achieved by patrols, and would require the commitment of an entire battalion, and he allocated the 46th to the task. As the Australians were determined to push forward to the third objective despite a longer delay on the second objective by the British on the right flank of the 12th Brigade, Leane gave the commanding officer of the 46th Battalion very specific instructions regarding his assault, including to attack in great depth and protect his right flank. About 15:00, the attack of the 46th was held up by German resistance, so once he received this report, Leane went forward and urged its commanding officer to renew the attack as soon as artillery support could be arranged. The commanding officer argued against this approach, saying that his men were exhausted and needed rest and food. Leane accepted this, and it was decided that the attack would be renewed at 23:00. Leane, concerned about his exposed right flank caused by the failure of the British to go forward, ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to prepare to attack across the divisional boundary and capture a hill in the forward area of the British <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Division</a>, but had to cancel the order when the British divisional commander objected. Instead, he had the two companies advance to a position protecting that flank but within his brigade boundary.

That night, the 46th's attack was a great success, netting about 550 prisoners. Leane placed the two companies of the 48th under the command of the 46th to assist in consolidation of the position. The attack of the 46th, and on its left flank, the <a href="14th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">14th Battalion</a>, was an "extraordinarily daring attack", which, according to Bean, achieved results rarely achieved on the Western Front, and it was only on the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a> front that the third objective of the attack was achieved. The British on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, but Leane, sending a patrol to make contact, quickly ascertained this report was incorrect. It was later found that what had been referred to as the Hindenburg Outpost Line was in fact being held as the main German position. The 12th Brigade had suffered casualties amounting to 19 officers and 282 men in achieving this success. The 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest. The brigade did not return to combat before the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice of 11 November 1918</a>.

After the war had ended, Leane acted as the commander of the 4th Division for a month, took some leave, was mentioned in despatches for the seventh time, and was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre. In April, he ceased to command the 12th Brigade, as it had been amalgamated with another brigade as men were <a href="repatriation">repatriated</a> to Australia. Leane then travelled to the United Kingdom, where he was appointed as General Officer Commanding No. 4 Group Hurdcott on the <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>, which had an important role in repatriation. In June, he was made a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>. The recommendation for the award read: 

In July, he was mentioned in despatches for the eighth and final time. In September he relinquished his duties at Hurdcott and embarked to return to Australia. Leane was variously described by Bean in his "<a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918</a>" as, "the head of the most famous family of soldiers in Australian history", "the fighting general "par excellence"", "the foremost fighting leader in the AIF", "a particularly cool and forcible – and serious commander", and a "great leader". He had a reputation as "a considerate leader, with great strength of character and a high sense of duty. In action he was... unflappable and heedless of danger". Of Leane's four brothers who served in World War I, two were killed. Six of his nephews also served, two of whom were killed. The Leanes became one of the nation's most distinguished fighting families, and were known as the "Fighting Leanes of Prospect".

Leane disembarked in Adelaide on 18 October 1919, and his appointment in the AIF was terminated, in accordance with normal repatriation procedures, on 3 January 1920. In addition to the decorations he had received during the war, he was also issued with the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Star">1914–15 Star</a>, <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a> and <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a>. While deployed overseas, he had been promoted to the <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> rank of lieutenant colonel in the peacetime Citizen Forces. On 13 May 1920, it was announced that Leane would be the next Commissioner of the <a href="South%20Australia%20Police">South Australia Police</a> from 1 July, replacing <a href="Thomas%20Edwards%20%28police%20commissioner%29">Thomas Edwards</a>. Leane's appointment was something of a surprise to senior police officers, who, based on long-standing arrangements, expected that the commissioner would be appointed from within the force. At the time, Leane was described as a "splendid fellow" by soldiers who had served under his command, and it was observed that "tact and firm decision" were outstanding features of his character. When the Police Association, which represented the rank-and-file of the force, met on 29 June, Leane's appointment was freely discussed, and it was resolved that, despite the fact that they, as a body, were opposed to the appointment of an outsider as Commissioner, they would be loyal to him. The meeting also decided to ask Leane to meet with representatives of each branch of the service as soon as possible, to discuss various grievances and suggest reforms.

In July 1920, Leane was appointed to command the part-time 19th Infantry Brigade, which encompassed the metropolitan area of Adelaide and the south-east districts of South Australia, and was part of the peacetime military structure. In the same year, he was appointed as an "<a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>" to the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>. In May of the following year, as part of a re-organisation of the Citizen Forces, he was appointed to command the 3rd Infantry Brigade. In response to Leane's annual report on the police force in December 1922, "<a href="The%20Register%20%28Adelaide%29">The Register</a>" newspaper observed that Leane had "dispelled, for the most part, any feeling of regret at his appointment which existed among members of the force", and that he had won their respect by his strict impartiality, consideration and sense of justice. It also stated that the conditions of police service had markedly improved in the two years since his appointment.

In June 1923, Leane brought a case of <a href="defamation">defamation</a> against <a href="Harry%20Kneebone">Harry Kneebone</a>, the editor of the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> (ALP) newspaper, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Herald%20%28Adelaide%29">The Daily Herald</a>". The case alleged that Kneebone had impugned Leane's reputation over the conduct of the 3rd Infantry Brigade annual camp at <a href="Wingfield%2C%20South%20Australia">Wingfield</a> in March that year, over which Leane had presided. The paper had described the camp as a "breeding ground for outlawry", had claimed that discipline was lacking, and that the food and accommodation was poor, among other things. <a href="Bill%20Denny">Bill Denny</a>, a lawyer and ALP Member of Parliament, represented Kneebone. It was determined that there was a "<a href="prima%20facie">prima facie</a>" case against the defendant, and the matter was scheduled for trial in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme Court</a> in October, but the jury was unable to come to a verdict and were dismissed. The case was abandoned in November.

By July 1923, "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" newspaper was reporting that Leane's approach over his three years at the helm had made a significant difference in the administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority as the basis for promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact in dealing with the public. In February 1925, Leane hosted a conference of commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> and <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a>, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the <a href="Volunteer%20Officers%27%20Decoration">Volunteer Officers' Decoration</a>.

In 1926–1927, a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> into bribery of members of the police by <a href="Bookmaker%20%28gambling%29">bookmaker</a>s was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables were guilty of taking bribes. After considering the report of the Royal Commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague nature of its findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20of%20South%20Australia">Chief Secretary</a>, <a href="James%20Jelley">James Jelley</a>, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables to be rotated through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the <a href="National%20War%20Memorial%20%28South%20Australia%29">National War Memorial</a> in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Club of Adelaide</a>, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen.

In September 1928, Leane provided police protection to non-<a href="trade%20union">union</a> <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s brought in to work on the <a href="Port%20Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a> wharves to circumvent a dispute over the <a href="industrial%20award">industrial award</a> that covered the waterfront. Leane went to the extent of personally supervising police operations, despite a lack of unrest at the beginning of the dispute. There were suggestions that <a href="communist">communist</a>s were interfering in internal union deliberations to resolve the matter. A week later, the continued employment of non-union labour resulted in significant violence on the waterfront. On the morning of 27 September, a crowd of between 4,000–5,000 unionists and others overran the Port Adelaide wharves, boarding ships and injuring and intimidating strikebreakers. That afternoon, a crowd of 2,000 marched the from Port Adelaide to <a href="Outer%20Harbor%2C%20South%20Australia">Outer Harbor</a> to confront the strikebreakers working there. Leane, accompanied by just one inspector, met the leaders and attempted to dissuade them from entering the wharf area. Instead, the crowd surged forward towards the docks. But Leane, his inspectors and about 150 mounted and foot police immediately set into motion plans to first break up the mass of the crowd among the buildings, then cordon off a significant portion of it in an open allotment. For some time they remained at a stalemate, but the crowd eventually dispersed having been unable to approach any of the strikebreakers or the vessels they were working on. The unionists had attacked a number of police and police horses, there had been a considerable amount of stone throwing by the crowd, and the police had used their batons freely at times. The events of the day were described in "The Register" as "probably without parallel in the history of the state".

Over the following weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in as part of the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at <a href="Fort%20Largs">Fort Largs</a> and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he was on hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in <a href="Parliament%20of%20South%20Australia">Parliament</a>. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.

In November 1928, two of Leane's sons, Lionel and Geoffrey, had joined the mounted police. In 1931, "<a href="Sunday%20Mail%20%28Adelaide%29">The Mail</a>" newspaper published a glowing article on Leane's eleven years as commissioner, praising the discipline and efficiency he had brought to the force, and describing him as a "true fighter" and "humane leader", who "never asks a man to do what he would not do himself". In the following year, Leane introduced 15–17 year old police cadets into the force, in a push to recruit more highly trained men. He specified that if all other things were equal, preference for the cadetships would be given to the sons of deceased returned servicemen. In 1934, Leane built on this scheme by introducing probationary police training for youths aged 17 to 20. Leane was also an advocate for the role of female police officers, and was the first to place a woman in control of the female members of the force. In 1934, he introduced <a href="police%20dog">police dog</a>s into service, and in the following year he unveiled a memorial to police officers who had died on duty since 1862. Also in 1935, Leane proposed a nationwide scheme to analyse traffic accidents to determine the risk factors contributing to them, and tailor police traffic enforcement operations, and in the interim, implemented such a program in South Australia. In 1936, a biographical sketch of Leane mentioned that he was a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>, had been president of the Commonwealth Club in Adelaide, was the chairman of the South Australian branch of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Public%20Administration%20Australia">Institute of Public Administration</a>, and had been awarded the <a href="King%20George%20V%20Silver%20Jubilee%20Medal">King George V Silver Jubilee Medal</a> the previous year.

In 1937, Leane was made an <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20John%20%28chartered%201888%29">Officer of the Order of Saint John</a>, and also received the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Coronation%20Medal">King George VI Coronation Medal</a>. In the same year he introduced training in <a href="morse%20code">morse code</a> for police officers, presaging the introduction of radio to the police force. In 1938, Leane was placed on the retired list of military officers, having reached 60 years of age. His service in the police was extended by an act of Parliament allowing him to serve until he was 65. Leane's continuing concern about traffic accidents and their consequences was highlighted by a map maintained in his office, on which all accidents were marked. In April 1939, with the danger of war in Europe, Leane became a member of the State Emergency Civil Defence Council, with responsibilities for internal security, protection of vulnerable points, control of the civil population, intelligence, detention of enemy civil aircraft, civil flying, and the air examination service.

In the same year, after the outbreak of World War II, Leane advocated for the introduction of radio communications into the police, stressing the need for quick response in cases of civil emergency. On 18 June 1940, Leane was appointed as the commander of the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League</a>-organised <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a> (VDC) in South Australia, an organisation similar to the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> in the United Kingdom. Within two weeks, more than 2,000 returned World War I servicemen had enlisted in the VDC. In response to the outbreak of war, by July 1940 Leane had authorised the swearing-in of 3,000 special constables to guard vulnerable points and industry against <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a> elements. On 19 October, Leane commanded a parade of more than 5,000 VDC members, including 2,000 who had travelled from country areas. By February 1941, the VDC had increased to a strength of 8,000 men. During World War II, South Australia was the only state to permit members of the police to enlist in the armed forces, but this was withdrawn after Japan entered the war, due to the need to maintain police numbers. In July 1943, Leane's appointment as VDC commander was extended for twelve months, despite the fact that he had reached the normal Army retirement age of 65. On 30 June 1944, Leane retired as police commissioner, and was replaced by <a href="William%20Francis%20Johns">William Francis Johns</a>, a serving superintendent.

After Leane's retirement as police commissioner, he briefly continued his work with the VDC, resigning on 30 July 1944. He was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in the 1945 King's birthday honours for his services as police commissioner over a 24-year period. For his service with the VDC during World War II he was issued with the <a href="War%20Medal%201939%E2%80%931945">War Medal 1939–1945</a> and <a href="Australia%20Service%20Medal%201939%E2%80%931945">Australia Service Medal 1939–1945</a>. In 1946, he became the inaugural president of the Plympton branch of the conservative <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a>, the forerunner of the state <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28South%20Australian%20Division%29">Liberal Party</a>. He continued to lead the Adelaide Anzac Day March each year, and on 7 September 1946 was invested with his knighthood by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a>, <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>.

His police cadet system was allowed to lapse after his retirement, but it was re-introduced by <a href="John%20McKinna">John McKinna</a>, another former soldier, who became commissioner in 1957. He remained a strong advocate of part-time soldiering, as well as a system of universal military training. Leane lived in Adelaide until his death at the <a href="Repatriation%20General%20Hospital%2C%20Daw%20Park">Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park</a> on 25 June 1962, with him and his wife celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary two weeks before his death. He was buried in <a href="Centennial%20Park%20Cemetery">Centennial Park Cemetery</a>, and was survived by his wife, Edith, and six children: five sons and a daughter. His son Geoffrey was originally a mounted policeman then a detective, was a lieutenant colonel and twice mentioned in despatches during World War II, later became a police inspector, and was deputy commissioner from 1959 to 1972. His namesake son, known as Lionel, became a detective sergeant. Another son, Benjamin, was a warrant officer during World War II, and survived being a <a href="prisoner-of-war">prisoner-of-war</a> of the Japanese.

On receiving the news of his death, McKinna said that Leane was "a grand man and an excellent soldier", who "was really the father of the present-day police force, as during his term as police commissioner he reorganised the whole force". He also said that, "The force was now receiving the benefits of his reorganisation and the many new systems and improvements he introduced". He observed that Leane "was always a strict disciplinarian but was scrupulously fair in all his dealings". The <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier of South Australia</a>, Sir <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20IV">Thomas Playford</a>, said that Leane "had been one of the great generals of World War I, and had also served with conspicuous ability as police commissioner for many years".

A Child of Our Time

A Child of Our Time is a secular <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> by the British composer <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a> (190598), who also wrote the <a href="libretto">libretto</a>. Composed between 1939 and 1941, it was first performed at the <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi Theatre</a>, London, on 19 March 1944. The work was inspired by events that affected Tippett profoundly: the assassination in 1938 of a German diplomat by a young Jewish refugee, and the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> government's reaction in the form of a violent <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a> against its Jewish population—called <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>. Tippett's oratorio deals with these incidents in the context of the experiences of oppressed people generally, and carries a strongly pacifist message of ultimate understanding and reconciliation. The text's recurrent themes of shadow and light reflect the <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jungian</a> psychoanalysis which Tippett underwent in the years immediately before writing the work.

The oratorio uses a traditional three-part format based on that of <a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Handel's "Messiah"</a>, and is structured in the manner of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>'s Passions. The work's most original feature is Tippett's use of African-American <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>, which carry out the role allocated by Bach to <a href="chorale">chorale</a>s. Tippett justified this innovation on the grounds that these songs of oppression possess a universality absent from traditional hymns. "A Child of Our Time" was well received on its first performance, and has since been performed all over the world in many languages. A number of recorded versions are available, including one conducted by Tippett when he was 86 years old.

<a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a> was born in London in 1905, to well-to-do though unconventional parents. His father, a lawyer and businessman, was a <a href="freethought">freethinker</a>, his mother a writer and <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>. He received piano lessons as a child, but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at <a href="Stamford%20School">Stamford School</a> in Lincolnshire, between 1920 and 1922. Although the school's formal music curriculum was slight, Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler, a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, himself a former pupil at Stamford. Tippett's chance purchase in a local bookshop of <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Stanford</a>'s book "Musical Composition" led to his determination to be a composer, and in April 1923 he was accepted as a student at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (RCM). Here he studied composition, first under <a href="Charles%20Wood%20%28composer%29">Charles Wood</a> (who died in 1926) and later, less successfully, with <a href="Charles%20Herbert%20Kitson">Charles Kitson</a>. He also studied conducting, first under Sargent and later under <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a>. He left the RCM in December 1928, but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer, he returned to the college in 1930 for a further period of study, principally under the professor of <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, <a href="R.%20O.%20Morris">R. O. Morris</a>.

In the economically depressed 1930s Tippett adopted a strongly left-wing political stance, and became increasingly involved with the unemployed, both through his participation in the North Yorkshire work camps, and as founder of the South London Orchestra made up of out-of-work musicians. He was briefly a member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a> in 1935, but his sympathies were essentially <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyist</a>, inimical to the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> orientation of his local party, and he soon left. In 1935 he embraced pacifism, but by this time he was becoming overtaken by a range of emotional problems and uncertainties, largely triggered by the break-up of an intense relationship with the painter Wilfred Franks. In addition to these personal difficulties he became anxious that the political situation in Europe was leading inexorably towards war. After meeting the Jungian psychoanalyst <a href="John%20Layard">John Layard</a>, Tippett underwent a period of therapy which included self-analysis of his dreams. According to Tippett's biographer Geraint Lewis, the outcome of this process was a "rebirth, confirming for Tippett the nature of his homosexuality while ... strengthening his destiny as a creative artist at the possible expense of personal relationships". The encounter with Layard led Tippett to a lifelong interest in the work and teaching of <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, an influence carried through into many of his subsequent compositions.

In the mid-to-late 1930s several of Tippett's early works were published, including his String Quartet No. 1, Sonata No. 1 for piano, and <a href="Concerto%20for%20Double%20String%20Orchestra%20%28Tippett%29">Concerto for Double String Orchestra</a>. Among his unpublished output in these years were two works for voice: the ballad-opera "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%28opera%29">Robin Hood</a>", written for performance at the Yorkshire work camps, and "A Song of Liberty" based on <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Heaven%20and%20Hell">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a>". As his self-confidence increased, Tippett felt increasingly driven to write a work of overt political protest. In his search for a subject he first considered the Dublin <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> of 1916: he may have been aware that <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> had written incidental music to <a href="Montagu%20Slater">Montagu Slater</a>'s play "Easter 1916". However, events towards the end of 1938 turned his attention away from Irish matters. Tippett had made several visits to Germany, and had acquired a love for its literature and culture. He became increasingly distressed by reports of events in that country and, in particular the persecution of its Jewish population. In November 1938 the assassination in Paris of a German diplomat, <a href="Ernst%20vom%20Rath">Ernst vom Rath</a>, by <a href="Herschel%20Grynszpan">Herschel Grynszpan</a>, a 17-year-old Jewish refugee, precipitated the "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>" pogrom across Germany. Over several days of violence synagogues were burned, Jewish homes and businesses attacked and destroyed, thousands of Jews were arrested, and some Jews were stoned or beaten to death. Reports from Germany of these events affected Tippett profoundly, and became the inspiration for his first large-scale dramatic work.

Having found his subject, Tippett sought advice on the preparation of the text from <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, whom he had met recently through a mutual friend, Francis Morley. The musicologist <a href="Michael%20Steinberg%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Steinberg</a> comments that, given his anti-Semitism, Eliot may have been an inappropriate choice of collaborator, though Tippett considered the poet his spiritual and artistic mentor, and felt that his counsel would be crucial. Tippett writes: "I plucked up courage and asked him if he would write it. Eliot said he would consider the matter as long as I provided him with a precise scheme of musical sections and an exact indication of the numbers and kinds of words for each stage". When Tippett produced his detailed draft, Eliot advised the composer to write his own libretto, suggesting that his own superior poetry would either distract attention from the music, or otherwise would be "swallowed up by it". Either way, there would be a mismatch. Tippett accepted this advice; henceforth, he records, he always wrote his own texts.

Tippett resolved that his work would be an oratorio rather than an opera. He chose the title from "Ein Kind unserer Zeit", a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer, <a href="%C3%96d%C3%B6n%20von%20Horv%C3%A1th">Ödön von Horváth</a>.
The text that Tippett prepared follows the three-part structure used in Handel's "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>", in which Part I is prophetic and preparatory, Part II narrative and epic, Part III meditative and metaphysical. In "A Child of Our Time" the general condition of oppression is defined in the first part, the narrative elements are confined to the second part, while the third part contains interpretation and reflection on a possible healing. Tippett perceived the work as a general depiction of man's inhumanity to man, and wanted Grynszpan's tragedy to stand for the oppressed everywhere. To preserve the universality of the work, Tippett avoids all use of proper names for people and places: thus, Paris is "a great city", Grynszpan becomes "the boy", the <a href="soprano">soprano</a> is "the boy's mother", vom Rath is "the official".

Commentators have identified numerous works as textual influences, including Eliot's "<a href="Murder%20in%20the%20Cathedral">Murder in the Cathedral</a>" and "<a href="Ash%20Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a>", <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>'s "<a href="Goethe%27s%20Faust">Faust</a>" and <a href="Wilfred%20Owen">Wilfred Owen</a>'s poem "The Seed". Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp equates the ending of the oratorio to the closing pages of Part I of <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s "<a href="Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>", in which Christian and Hopeful end their journey by crossing a deep and wide river to reach their heavenly home. The influence of Jungian themes is evident in the recurrent images of darkness and light, and the recognition and balancing of opposites. In a recent analysis of the work, Richard Rodda finds "A Child of Our Time" "rooted in the essential dialectic of human life that Tippett so prized in Jung's philosophy—winter/spring, darkness/light, evil/good, reason/pity, dreams/reality, loneliness/fellowship, the man of destiny/the child of our time..."

A recent photographic discovery suggests that, contrary to previous assumptions, Herschel Grynszpan may have survived the holocaust and the war, and gone on to live in Paris, Israel or the USA: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/18/herschel-grynszpan-photo-mystery-jewish-assassin-kristallnacht-pogrom

Tippett completed his Jungian psychoanalysis on 31 August 1939. Three days later, on the day that Britain declared war on Germany, he began composing "A Child of Our Time". His grounding in the traditions of European music guided him instinctively towards the Passions of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> as his basic musical model. Thus the building blocks of the work are familiar: recitatives, arias, choruses and ensembles, with a male soloist acting as a narrator and the chorus as full participants in the action. Tippett also introduced two other formal number types: the operatic scena and the orchestral interlude, the latter allowing time for reflection on significant events. Tippett wished to punctuate his work with an equivalent to the congregation chorales which recur in Bach's Passions; however, he wanted his work to speak to atheists, agnostics and Jews as well as to Christians. He considered briefly whether folk-songs, or even Jewish hymns, could provide an alternative, but rejected these because he felt that, like the chorales, they lacked universality. A solution was suggested to him when he heard on the radio a rendering of the <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spiritual</a> "<a href="Steal%20Away">Steal away</a>". In particular he was struck by the power of the words "The trumpet sounds within-a my soul". This led him to recognise spirituals as carrying an emotional significance far beyond their origin as slave songs in 19th-century America and as representing the oppressed everywhere.

Having found his substitute for the chorales, Tippett wrote off to America for a collection of spirituals. When this arrived, "I saw that there was one for every key situation in the oratorio". He chose five: "<a href="Steal%20Away">Steal Away</a>"; <a href="Nobody%20Knows%20the%20Trouble%20I%27ve%20Seen">"Nobody Knows the Trouble I See, Lord"</a>; <a href="Go%20Down%20Moses">"Go Down, Moses"</a>; "O, By and By"; and <a href="Deep%20River%20%28song%29">"Deep River"</a>. The first, fourth and fifth of these are placed at the ends of the oratorio's three parts, "Deep River" as the finale expressing, according to Tippett, the hope of a fresh spring after a long, dark winter. Kenneth Gloag, in his detailed analysis of the oratorio, writes: "As well as constructing the pathway through the dramatic narrative, the five spirituals also combine to provide moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work". Tippett felt that the work encapsulated all his current political, moral and psychological preoccupations.

According to Tippett's description, "Part I of the work deals with the general state of oppression in our time. Part II presents the particular story of a young man's attempt to seek justice by violence and the catastrophic consequences; and Part III considers the moral to be drawn, if any." He later extended his summary to the following:

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, Tippett joined the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>—with which he had been informally associated since 1935—and applied for registration as a conscientious objector, although his case was not considered by the tribunal until February 1942. In October 1940 he became director of music at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, where the previous April he had conducted the South London Orchestra in the premiere of his Concerto for Double String Orchestra. After completing the composition of "A Child of Our Time" in 1941, Tippett worked on other projects, feeling that the oratorio's pacifist message was out of touch with the prevailing national mood. <a href="Walter%20Goehr">Walter Goehr</a>, who conducted the Morley College orchestra, advised delaying its first performance until a more propitious time. In February 1942 Tippett was assigned by the tribunal to non-combative military duties. Following his appeal, this was changed to service either with <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">Air Raid Precautions</a> (ARP), with the <a href="National%20Fire%20Service">fire service</a> or on the land. He felt obliged to refuse these directions, and as a result was sentenced in June 1943 to three months' imprisonment, of which he served two months before his early release for good behaviour.

After his release from prison in August 1943, with encouragement from Britten and the youthful music critic <a href="John%20Amis">John Amis</a>, Tippett began to make arrangements for the oratorio's first performance. Goehr agreed to conduct, but overrode the composer's initial view that Morley College's orchestra could handle the work and insisted that professionals were needed. Tippett records that "somehow or other the money was scraped together to engage the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>". <a href="Morley%20College%20Choir">Morley College Choir</a>'s choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Britten's connection with <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Opera">Sadler's Wells Opera</a> brought three soloists to the project: <a href="Joan%20Cross">Joan Cross</a> (soprano), <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a> (tenor), and Roderick Lloyd (bass). The fourth singer, Margaret MacArthur (alto), came from Morley College. The premiere was arranged for 19 March 1944, at London's <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi Theatre</a>. Before this event Amis introduced the work in an article for the February 1944 issue of "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>", in which he predicted a noteworthy musical occasion: "The general style of the oratorio is simple and direct, and the music will, I think, have an immediate effect on both audience and performers".

Later writers would state that "A Child of Our Time" placed Tippett in the first rank of the composers of his generation, and most of the early reviews were favourable. Among these, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"s critic called the work "strikingly original in conception and execution", and wrote that Tippett had succeeded quite remarkably in writing an effective tract for the times. A second "Times" review, written a few days after the premiere, suggested that the oratorio had articulated a key contemporary question: "How is the conflict of the inevitable with the intolerable to be resolved?" It pointed to the hope expressed in the final spiritual, "Deep River", and concluded that despite some weak passages the work created a successful partnership between art and philosophy. <a href="William%20Glock">William Glock</a> in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" was laudatory: "The most moving and important work by an English composer for many years". Glock found that the spirituals suited the themes of the oratorio perfectly, and had been arranged "with a profound sense of beauty".

In "The Musical Times" <a href="Edwin%20Evans%20%28music%20critic%29">Edwin Evans</a> praised Tippett's text: "simple and direct ... he has wisely resisted any temptation to use quasi-biblical or 'Pilgrim's Progress' language." Evans was uncertain whether the music was truly reflective of the words: "...the emotion seemed singularly cool under the provocations described in the text". Unlike Glock, Evans was unconvinced by the case for the inclusion of the spirituals: "[T]he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment". <a href="Eric%20Blom">Eric Blom</a>, in "Music & Letters", thought the idea of using spirituals "brilliant", and the analogy with Bach's chorales convincing. Blom was less enthusiastic about the text, which he found "very terse and bald – rather poor, really"—though he thought this preferable to the pomposities such as those that characterise libretti written for <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>. In his autobiography, Tippett makes only muted references to the premiere, noting that the event "had some mixed reviews", but in a letter to his friend Francesca Allinson he professed himself delighted with the breadth of response to the work: "It's got over not only to the ordinary listeners but even to the intellectuals like [Mátyás] Seiber, who has written to me of some of the 'lovely texture of some of the numbers'".

The generally positive reception of the premiere persuaded <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a>, then serving as the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s director of music, to arrange a broadcast performance of the work. This took place on 10 January 1945 shortly after which, in February, Tippett conducted the work at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. The radio broadcast had been heard by Howard Hartog, a music writer and publisher who just after the war was in <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">Occupied Germany</a>, attempting to re-establish the <a href="North%20German%20Radio%20Symphony%20Orchestra">North German Radio Symphony Orchestra</a> in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. As part of this endeavour he decided to mount a performance of "A Child of Our Time", with <a href="Hans%20Schmidt-Isserstedt">Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt</a> conducting. Because of his pacifism and record as a conscientious objector, Tippett was not allowed into the occupied zone and thus missed the performance. However, in 1947 he was able to travel to <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> where his friend, the Hungarian composer <a href="M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s%20Seiber">Mátyás Seiber</a>, had organised a performance by <a href="Magyar%20R%C3%A1di%C3%B3">Hungarian Radio</a>. The local singers' problems with the English text meant that the work was sung in Hungarian, which Tippett, who conducted, described as "a very odd experience".

In the early 1950s Tippett attended a performance of the oratorio at the Radio Hall in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, after which members of the audience expressed to him their gratitude for the work which, they said, exactly represented their wartime experiences. In December 1952 he travelled to <a href="Turin">Turin</a> for a radio performance, conducted by <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> and with operatic stars <a href="Elisabeth%20Schwarzkopf">Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</a> and <a href="Nicolai%20Gedda">Nicolai Gedda</a> among the soloists. He records that during the rehearsals the bass soloist, <a href="Mario%20Petri">Mario Petri</a>, had problems singing his recitatives, and that despite some coaching from the composer, was still "at sea" during the performance. Karajan asked Tippett if he would object to an extra interval in Part II, to which Tippett replied that he would mind very much. Karajan nevertheless imposed the break, thus presenting a four-part version of the work.

In May 1962 "A Child of Our Time" received its Israel premiere in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. Tippett says that this performance was delayed because for a while there were local objections to the word "Jesus" in the text. When it came about, among the audience was Herschel Grynszpan's father who, Tippett wrote, was "manifestly touched by the work his son's precipitate action 25 years earlier had inspired." The performance, by the <a href="Kol%20Yisrael">Kol Yisrael</a> Orchestra with the Tel Aviv Chamber Choir, was acclaimed by the audience of 3000, but received mixed reviews from the press. "The Times" report noted contrasting opinions from two leading Israeli newspapers. The correspondent for "<a href="Haaretz">Haaretz</a>" had expressed disappointment: "Every tone is unoriginal, and the work repeats old effects in a most conventional manner". Conversely, according to the "Times" report, "<a href="HaBoker">HaBoker</a>"'s critic had "found that the composition had moved everyone to the depths of his soul ... no Jewish composer had ever written anything so sublime on the theme of the Holocaust."

Despite its successes in Europe "A Child of Our Time" did not reach the United States until 1965, when it was performed during the <a href="Aspen%20Music%20Festival%20and%20School">Aspen Music Festival</a>, with the composer present. In his memoirs Tippett mentions another performance on that American tour, at a women's college in Baltimore, in which the male chorus and soloists were black Catholic ordinands from a local seminary. The first significant American presentations of the work came a decade later: at <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> in 1977 where <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, who was visiting, delayed his departure so that he could attend, and at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>, New York, where <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> conducted the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> and the <a href="Tanglewood%20Festival%20Chorus">Tanglewood Festival Chorus</a>. Reviewing this performance for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Donal%20Henahan">Donal Henahan</a> was unconvinced that the work's "sincerity and unimpeachable intentions add[ed] up to important music". The spirituals were sung with passion and fervour, but the rest was "reminiscent of a familiar pious sermon" in which the words were only intermittently intelligible. Meanwhile, the work had achieved its African debut, where in 1975 Tippett observed a performance with an improvised orchestra which incorporated the Zambian Police Band. The Zambian president, <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a>, was present, and entertained the composer afterwards.

In October 1999, in the year following Tippett's death, "A Child of Our Time" received a belated <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The "New York Times" reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment that this was the orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, <a href="English%20National%20Opera">English National Opera</a> staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by <a href="Jonathan%20Kent%20%28director%29">Jonathan Kent</a>—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>. Anna Picard, writing in "The Independent", recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: "Do we really need to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit in order to understand the Holocaust?" <a href="Anthony%20Holden">Anthony Holden</a> in "The Observer" was more positive, commenting that "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the <a href="Kennedy%20Center">Kennedy Center</a> in Washington DC by a special performance of "A Child of Our time", in which the Washington Chorus was directed by <a href="Robert%20Shafer%20%28conductor%29">Robert Shafer</a>. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.

"A Child of Our Time" has survived periods of indifference, particularly in America, to be ranked alongside Britten's "<a href="War%20Requiem">War Requiem</a>" as one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period. According to Meirion Bowen, Tippett's long-time companion and a champion of his music, the work's particular quality is its universal message, with which audiences all over the world have identified. In his notes accompanying the performance at the 2010 <a href="Grant%20Park%20Music%20Festival">Grant Park Music Festival</a> in Chicago, Richard E. Rodda summarises the work's continuing appeal: "[I]t deals with issues as timeless as civilization itself—man's inhumanity to man, the place of the individual who confronts ruthless power ... the need for learning the lessons of history and for compassion and understanding and honesty and equality in our dealings with each other, whatever our differences may be. Tippett's Child still speaks profoundly to us in our own deeply troubled time".

Kemp describes Tippett's central problem in composing "A Child of Our Time" as integrating the language of the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett was, in Kemp's view, entirely successful in this respect; "O by and by", he says, sounds as if it could almost have been composed by Tippett. To assist the process of integration the composer had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the <a href="Hall%20Johnson">Hall Johnson Choir</a>, which provided him with a three-part model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals: chorus, soloists, chorus. Tippett's instructions in the score specify that "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung'".

The brief orchestral prelude to Part I introduces the two contrasting moods which pervade the entire work. Kemp likens the opening "snarling trumpet triad" to "a descent into Hades", but it is answered immediately by a gently mournful phrase in the strings. In general the eight numbers which comprise this first part each have, says Gloag, their own distinct texture and harmonic identity, often in a disjunctive relationship with each other, although the second and third numbers are connected by an orchestral "interludium". From among the diverse musical features Steinberg draws attention to rhythms in the chorus "When Shall The Usurer's City Cease" that illustrate Tippett's knowledge of and feel for the English <a href="madrigal">madrigal</a>. What Kemp describes as "one of the supreme moments in Tippett's music" occurs towards the end of the Part, as the soprano's aria melts into the spiritual "Steal away": "a [transition] so poignant as to set off that instant shock of recognition that floods the eyes with emotion ... although the soprano continues to grieve in a floating <a href="melisma">melisma</a>, the spiritual comes as a relief as well as a release".

Because of its large number (17) of generally short components, Part II is the most diffuse of the three parts, texturally and harmonically. The narrative is driven largely by alternating choruses and comments from the Narrator, with two brief operatic scenas in which the four soloists participate. Kemp finds in one of the choruses an allusion to "Sei gegrüsset" from Bach's "<a href="St%20John%20Passion">St John Passion</a>", and hears traces of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a> in the soprano's solo "O my son!" which begins the first scena. The narrative climax is reached with the "Spiritual of Anger": "Go Down, Moses", which Tippett arranges in the form of a chorale. This is followed by three short meditations from tenor, soprano and alto soloists, before a possible redemption is glimpsed in the spiritual which ends the Part, "O by and by", with a soprano descant which Steinberg describes as "ecstatic". Part III consists of only five numbers, each rather more extensive than most of those in the earlier sections of the oratorio. The Part has, on the whole, a greater unity than its predecessors. The musical and emotional climax to the whole work is the penultimate ensemble: "I Would Know my Shadow and my Light". Kemp writes: "The whole work has been leading to this moment ... the ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction [before] a modulation leads into 'Deep River'". In this final spiritual, for the first time the full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed. The oratorio ends quietly, on an extended "pianissimo" "Lord".

The total vocal and instrumental resources required for the oratorio are a <a href="SATB">SATB</a> chorus with soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloists, and an orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, cymbals and strings. According to the vocal score, the approximate duration of the work is 66 minutes.

The first recording of "A Child of Our Time" was issued in 1958, and remained the only available version for 17 years. <a href="Colin%20Davis">Sir Colin Davis</a> made the first of his three recordings of the work in 1975. Tippett himself, at the age of 86, conducted a recording of the work with the <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</a> and Chorus in 1991.

History of the board game Monopoly

The board game "<a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>" has its <a href="origin">origin</a> in the early 20th century. The earliest known version of "Monopoly", known as "<a href="The%20Landlord%27s%20Game">The Landlord's Game</a>", was designed by an American, <a href="Elizabeth%20Magie">Elizabeth Magie</a>, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of <a href="Henry%20George">Henry George</a>, originally intended "The Landlord's Game" to illustrate the economic consequences of <a href="law%20of%20rent">Ricardo's Law</a> of <a href="Economic%20rent">Economic rent</a> and the <a href="Georgism">Georgist</a> concepts of economic privilege and <a href="land%20value%20tax">land value tax</a>ation. A series of <a href="board%20game">board game</a>s was developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of "Monopoly" sold by <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a> and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the midwestern United States and near the East Coast of the United States East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.

By the 1970s, the idea that the game had been created solely by <a href="Charles%20Darrow">Charles Darrow</a> had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's instructions for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to "Monopoly", and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a>.

Also in the 1970s, Professor <a href="Ralph%20Anspach">Ralph Anspach</a>, who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and <a href="trust%20busting">trust busting</a>, fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company, <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a>, over the copyright and trademarks of the "Monopoly" board game. Through the research of Anspach and others, much of the early history of the game was "rediscovered" and entered into official United States court records. Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' copyright and trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements; other elements of the game are still protected under copyright law. At the conclusion of the court case, the game's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger "Monopoly" brand, licensed by Parker Brothers' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day. Despite the "rediscovery" of the board game's early history in the 1970s and 1980s, and several books and journal articles on the subject, <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> (which became Parker Brothers' parent company) did not acknowledge any of the game's history before Charles Darrow on its official "Monopoly" website as recently as June 2012, nor did they acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them, at least as recently as 2009.

International tournaments, first held in the early 1970s, continue to the present, although the last national tournaments and world championship were held in 2009. Starting in 1985, a new generation of spin-off board games and <a href="card%20game">card game</a>s appeared on both sides of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. In 1989, the first of many <a href="Video%20game">video game and computer game</a> editions was published. Since 1994, many official variants of the game, based on locations other than <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> (the official U.S. setting) or <a href="London">London</a> (the official <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> setting, excepting Canada), have been published by Hasbro or its licensees. In 2008, Hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard U.S. Edition of the game to match the UK Edition, although the U.S. standard edition maintains the <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a> property names. Hasbro also modified the official logo to give the "Mr. Monopoly" character a 3-D computer-generated look, which has since been adopted by licensees <a href="USAopoly">USAopoly</a>, <a href="Winning%20Moves">Winning Moves</a> and <a href="Winning%20Solutions">Winning Solutions</a>. And Hasbro has also been including the Speed Die, introduced in 2006's "Monopoly: The Mega Edition" by Winning Moves Games, in versions produced directly by Hasbro (such as the 2009 "Championship Edition").
In 1903, <a href="Georgism">Georgist</a> <a href="Elizabeth%20Magie">Lizzie Magie</a> applied for a patent on a game called "<a href="The%20Landlord%27s%20Game">The Landlord's Game</a>" with the object of showing that <a href="Renting">rent</a>s enriched property owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would find it hard to understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the <a href="Georgism">Georgist</a> solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. "The Landlord's Game" became one of the first board games to use a "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of "ownership" of a place on a game board, such that something would happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of <a href="Arden%2C%20Delaware">Arden, Delaware</a> and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> series "<a href="History%20Detectives">History Detectives</a>". This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of "Monopoly" as published by Parker Brothers.

Although "The Landlord's Game" was patented, and some hand-made boards were made, it was not actually manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing her game. Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a> around 1910, which <a href="Parker%20Brothers">George Parker</a> declined to publish. In the UK, it was published in 1913 by the Newbie Game Company under the title "Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit". Shortly after the game's formal publication, <a href="Scott%20Nearing">Scott Nearing</a>, a professor in what was then known as the <a href="Wharton%20School%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Wharton School of Finance and Commerce</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others. After Nearing was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the <a href="University%20of%20Toledo">University of Toledo</a>. A former student of Nearing, <a href="Rexford%20Tugwell">Rexford Guy Tugwell</a>, also taught "The Landlord's Game" at Wharton, and took it with him to <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>. Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quakers</a>, Georgists, university students (including students at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, and <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>), and others who became aware of it.
A shortened version of Magie's game, which eliminated the second round of play that used a Georgist concept of a single <a href="land%20value%20tax">land value tax</a>, had become common during the 1910s, and this variation on the game became known as "Auction Monopoly". The auctioning part of the game came through a rule that auctioned any unowned property to all game players when it was first landed on. This rule was later dropped by the Quakers, and in the current game of "Monopoly" an auction takes place only when an unowned property is not purchased outright by the player that first lands on it. That same decade, the game became popular around the community of <a href="Reading%2C%20Pennsylvania">Reading</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Another former student of Scott Nearing, Thomas Wilson, taught the game to his cousin, Charles Muhlenberg, around 1915–1916. The original patent on "The Landlord's Game" expired in 1921. By this time, the hand-made games became known simply as "Monopoly". Charles Muhlenberg and his wife, Wilma, taught the game to Wilma's brothers, Louis and Ferdinand "Fred" Thun, in the early 1920s.

Simultaneous to these events, Magie moved back to <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and married Andrew Phillips. She moved to the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> area with her husband by 1923, and re-patented a revised version of "The Landlord's Game" in 1924 (under her married name, Elizabeth Magie Phillips). This version, unlike her first <a href="patent%20drawing">patent drawing</a>, included named streets (though the versions published in 1910 based on her first patent also had named streets). Magie sought to regain control over the plethora of hand-made games. For her 1924 edition, a couple of streets on the board were named after <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> streets and locations, notably "<a href="Chicago%20Loop">The Loop</a>" and "<a href="Lake%20Shore%20Drive">Lake Shore Drive</a>". This revision also included a special "monopoly" rule and card that allowed higher rents to be charged when all three <a href="Monopoly%20board%20layout">railroads and utilities</a> were owned, and included "chips" to indicate improvements on properties. Magie again approached Parker Brothers about her game, and George Parker again declined, calling the game "too political". Parker is, however, credited with urging Magie to take out her 1924 patent.

After the Thuns learned the game, they began teaching its rules to their fraternity brothers at <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a> around 1926. Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned the game from the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors). Layman later returned to his hometown of <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city. Layman then commercially produced and sold the game, starting in 1932, with a friend in Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories. This game was sold under the name "The Fascinating Game of Finance" (later shortened to "<a href="Finance%20%28game%29">Finance</a>"). Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric. The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color. Also in 1932, one edition of "The Landlord's Game" was published by the Adgame Company with a new set of rules called "Prosperity", also by Magie.

It was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins learned the game, and took it back to Atlantic City. After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names and railroads, and taught it to a group of local Quakers. It has been argued that their greatest contribution to the game was to reinstate the original Lizzie Magie rule of "buying properties at their listed price" rather than auctioning them, as the Quakers did not believe in auctions. Another source states that the Quakers simply "didn't like the noise of the auctioneering". Among the group taught the game by Hoskins were Eugene Raiford and his wife, who took a copy of the game with Atlantic City street names to Philadelphia. Due to the Raifords' unfamiliarity with streets and properties in Philadelphia, the Atlantic City-themed version was the one taught to Charles Todd, who in turn taught Esther Darrow, wife of <a href="Charles%20Darrow">Charles Darrow</a>. After learning the game, Darrow then began to distribute the game himself as "Monopoly" and never spoke to the Todds again. Darrow initially made the sets of the "Monopoly" game by hand with the help of his first son, William Darrow, and his wife. Their new sets retained Charles Todd's misspelling of <a href="Marven%20Gardens">"Marvin Gardens"</a> and the renaming of the Shore Fast Line the Short Line. Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of <a href="Textile%20manufacturing%20terminology%23O">oilcloth</a>, and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the title deed cards and the <a href="Chance%20cards">Chance cards</a> and <a href="Community%20Chest%20cards">Community Chest cards</a>. After the demand for the game increased, Darrow contacted a printing company, Patterson and White, which printed the designs of the property spaces on square <a href="carton">carton</a> boards. Darrow's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers, including black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the car on "Free Parking", the red arrow for "Go", the faucet on "Water Works", the light bulb on "Electric Company", and the question marks on the "Chance" spaces, though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist. While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933, its specimens have disappeared from the files of the <a href="United%20States%20Copyright%20Office">United States Copyright Office</a>, though proof of its registration remains.

Darrow first took the game to <a href="Milton%20Bradley%20Company">Milton Bradley</a> and attempted to sell it as his personal invention. They rejected it in a letter dated May 31, 1934. After Darrow sent the game to Parker Brothers later in 1934, they rejected the game as "too complicated, too technical, [and it] took too long to play". Darrow received a rejection letter from the firm dated October 19, 1934. During this time, the "52 design errors" story was invented as a reason why Parker rejected Monopoly, but this has more recently been proven to be part of the Parker-invented "creation myth" surrounding the game.

In early 1935, however, the company heard about the game's excellent sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.

Robert Barton, president of <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a>, bought the rights to "Finance" from Knapp Electric later in 1935. "Finance" would be redeveloped, updated, and continued to be sold by Parker Brothers into the 1970s. Other board games based on a similar principle, such as a game called "Inflation", designed by Rudy Copeland and published by the Thomas Sales Co., in Fort Worth, Texas, also came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of "Monopoly". Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played "Monopoly" before Darrow's "invention" of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents. Other agreements were reached on "Big Business" by Transogram, and "<a href="Easy%20Money%20%28board%20game%29">Easy Money</a>" by Milton Bradley, based on Daniel Layman's "Finance". Another clone, called "Fortune", was sold by Parker Brothers, and became combined with "Finance" in some editions.

"Monopoly" was first marketed on a broad scale by Parker Brothers in 1935. A Standard Edition, with a small black box and separate board, and a larger Deluxe Edition, with a box large enough to hold the board, were sold in the first year of Parker Brothers' ownership. These were based on the two editions sold by Darrow. Parker Brothers sets were the first to include die-cast metal tokens for playing pieces, initially using a <a href="battleship">battleship</a>, a <a href="cannon">cannon</a>, a <a href="clothes%20iron">clothes iron</a>, a shoe, a top hat, and a thimble. George Parker himself rewrote many of the game's rules, insisting that "short game" and "time limit" rules be included. On the original Parker Brothers board (reprinted in 2002 by Winning Moves Games), there were no icons for the Community Chest spaces (the blue chest overflowing with gold coins came later) and no gold ring on the Luxury Tax space. Nor were there property values printed on spaces on the board. The Income Tax was slightly higher (being $300 or 10%, instead of the later $200 or 10%). Some of the designs known today were implemented at the behest of George Parker. The <a href="Chance%20cards">Chance cards</a> and <a href="Community%20Chest%20cards">Community Chest cards</a> were illustrated (though some prior editions consisted solely of text), but were without "<a href="Rich%20Uncle%20Pennybags">Rich Uncle Pennybags</a>", who was introduced in 1936.

Late in 1935, after learning of "The Landlord's Game" and "Finance", Robert Barton held a second meeting with Charles Darrow in Boston. Darrow admitted that he had copied the game from a friend's set, and he and Barton reached a revised royalty agreement, granting Parker Brothers worldwide rights and releasing Darrow from legal costs that would be incurred in defending the origin of the game.

In December 1935, Parker Brothers sent a copy of the game to Victor Watson, Sr. of <a href="Waddingtons">Waddington Games</a>. Watson and his son Norman tried the game over a weekend, and liked it so much that Waddington took the (then extraordinary) step of making a <a href="transatlantic%20telephone%20cable">transatlantic</a> "trunk call" to Parker Brothers, the first such call made or received by either company. This impressed Parker Brothers sufficiently that Waddington was granted licensing rights for Europe and the then-<a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a>, excluding Canada. Waddingtons version, their first board game, with locations from <a href="London">London</a> substituted for the original Atlantic City ones, was first produced in 1936.

The game was very successful in the United Kingdom and France, but the 1936 German edition, published by <a href="Schmidt%20Spiele">Schmidt Spiele</a> disappeared from the market within three years. This edition, featuring locations from Berlin, was denounced, allegedly by Joseph Goebbels to the Hitler Youth due to the game's "Jewish-speculative character". It is also alleged that the real reason behind the Nazi denouncement was due to the high-ranking members (i.e. Goebbels, again) who lived on those sections of the game board given the highest property values, and not wanting to be associated with a game. The game last appeared in a pre-World War II Schmidt Spiele catalog in 1938. A new German edition, with "generic" street and train station names (i.e., not chosen from a single German city) would not appear until 1953. The 1936 German edition, with the original cards and Berlin locations, was reprinted in 1982 by Parker Brothers and again in 2003 (in a wooden box), and 2011 (in a red metal tin) by <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a>.

Waddington licensed other editions from 1936 to 1938, and the game was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the <a href="Italian%20Fascism">fascists</a>, the game was changed dramatically so that it would have an Italian name, locations in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, and major changes in the rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936. As of 2009, Hasbro has taken over the publishing of the game in Italy, but have also, for now, kept the Milan-based properties.

In Austria, versions of the game first appeared as "Business" and "Spekulation" ("Speculation"), and eventually evolved to become "Das Kaufmännische Talent" (DKT) ("The Businessman's Talent"). Versions of DKT have been sold in Austria since 1940. The game first appeared as "Monopoly" in Austria in about 1981. The Waddingtons edition was imported into The Netherlands starting in 1937, and a fully translated edition first appeared in 1941.

Waddingtons later produced special games during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> which secretly contained files, a compass, a map printed on silk, and real currency hidden amongst the "Monopoly" money, to enable <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> to escape from German camps. However, this story has come under recent scrutiny and is being disputed.

Collector Albert C. Veldhuis features a map on his "Monopoly Lexicon" website showing which versions of the game were remade and distributed in other countries, with the Atlantic City, London, and Paris versions being the most influential. After World War II, homemade games would sometimes appear behind the Iron Curtain, despite the fact that the game was effectively banned. "Monopoly" is cited as the board game played most often and most duplicated via hand made copies in the former German Democratic Republic. One official version of the game was printed for the Soviet Union by Parker Brothers in 1988. After the Cold War ended, official editions have been published throughout eastern Europe by Parker, Tonka and Hasbro. Hungary was the first, in 1992, followed by the Czech Republic and Poland in 1993, Croatia in 1994, Slovenia in 1996, Romania and a new edition for Russia in 1997, and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, all in 2001.

In 1936, Parker Brothers published four further editions along with the original two: the Popular Edition, Fine Edition, Gold Edition, and Deluxe Edition, with prices ranging from US$2 to US$25 in 1930s money. After Parker Brothers began to release its first editions of the game, Elizabeth Magie Phillips was profiled in the Washington D.C. "Evening Star" newspaper, which discussed her two editions of "The Landlord's Game". In December 1936, wary of the <a href="Mahjong">Mah-Jongg</a> and <a href="Table%20tennis">Ping-Pong</a> fads that had left unsold inventory stuck in Parker Brothers' warehouse, George Parker ordered a stop to "Monopoly" production as sales leveled off. However, during the <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> season, sales picked up again, and continued a resurgence. In early 1937, as Parker Brothers was preparing to release the board game "Bulls and Bears" with Darrow's photograph on the box lid (though he had no involvement with the game), a "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine article about the game made it seem as if Darrow himself was the sole inventor of both "Bulls and Bears" and "Monopoly":
At the start of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled materials they could use for further game production. During the war, "Monopoly" was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's <a href="cellophane">cellophane</a> cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced to take the place of <a href="dice">dice</a>. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on "The Landlord's Game" expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of "Monopoly". The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.

After the war, sales went from 800,000 a year to over one million. The French and German editions re-entered production, and new editions for Spain, Greece, Finland and Israel were first produced. By the late 1950s, Parker Brothers printed only game sets with board, pieces and materials housed in a single white box. Several copies of this edition were exhibited at the American National Exhibition in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> in 1959. All of them were stolen from the exhibit. In the early 1960s, ""Monopoly" happenings" began to occur, mostly marathon game sessions, which were recognized by a "Monopoly" Marathon Records Documentation Committee in New York City. In addition to marathon sessions, games were played on large indoor and outdoor boards, within backyard pits, on the ceiling in a <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> dormitory room, and underwater. In 1965, a 30th anniversary set was produced in a special plastic case.

Parker Brothers was acquired by <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a> in February 1968. The first "Monopoly" edition in Braille is published in 1973. Also in 1973, as the Atlantic City Commissioner of Public Works considered name changes for Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, fans of the board game, with support from the president of Parker Brothers, successfully lobbied for the city to keep the names. After Parker Brothers was taken over by General Mills, the Monopoly license to Waddingtons was renegotiated (as was the Clue/<a href="Cluedo">Cluedo</a> license to Parker Brothers/General Mills by Waddingtons). By 1974, Parker Brothers had sold 80 million sets of the game. In 1975, another anniversary edition was produced, but this edition came in a cardboard box looking much like a standard edition. Parker Brothers was under management by General Mills as the first six Monopoly Tournaments were held. See "<a href="%23The%20%22Monopoly%22%20Tournaments%201973%E2%80%932009">The "Monopoly" Tournaments</a>" below.

Kenner was combined with Parker Brothers and spun off as Kenner Parker Toys in 1985. Regular and Deluxe 50th Anniversary editions of "Monopoly" were released that same year. The spinoff game "<a href="Advance%20to%20Boardwalk">Advance to Boardwalk</a>" was first published in 1985. Kenner Parker was acquired by Tonka in 1987. The 1987/1988 "Monopoly" Tournaments were held under Kenner Parker Tonka management.

In the United Kingdom, "Monopoly" publisher Waddingtons produced its first non-London edition in 1989, creating a Limited Edition based on <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> as a charity fundraiser.

In 1990, <a href="Merv%20Griffin%20Enterprises">Merv Griffin Enterprises</a> turned "Monopoly" into a <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%20show%29">prime time game show</a>, airing after "<a href="Super%20Jeopardy%21">Super Jeopardy!</a>" on Saturday nights on ABC. The program was hosted by <a href="Mike%20Reilly%20%28television%20personality%29">Mike Reilly</a> and announced by <a href="Charlie%20O%27Donnell">Charlie O'Donnell</a>.

"<a href="Monopoly%20Junior">Monopoly Junior</a>" was first published in 1990. Kenner Parker Tonka was acquired by Hasbro in 1991. An all-Europe edition was published by Parker Brothers in 1991 for the nations of the then <a href="European%20Communities">European Communities</a>, using the Ecu (European Currency Unit). After acquisition by Hasbro, publication of "Monopoly" in the U.S. ceased at the Parker Brothers plant in Salem, Massachusetts in November 1991.

In 1994, the license to the company that would become USAopoly was issued, and they produced a <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a> edition as their first board. In 1995, a license for new game variations and reprints of "Monopoly" was granted to <a href="Winning%20Moves">Winning Moves Games</a>. See the <a href="%23Localizations%2C%20licenses%2C%20and%20spin-offs">Localizations, licenses, and spin-offs</a> section below for details on further releases by both companies.

In 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was released in a gold box. In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29%23Equipment">token</a> to U.S. standard edition sets of "Monopoly". Voters were allowed to select from a <a href="biplane">biplane</a>, a <a href="piggy%20bank">piggy bank</a>, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free phone number, and at <a href="FAO%20Schwarz">FAO Schwarz</a> stores.

In March 1999, Hasbro announced that the winner was the sack of money (with 51 percent of the vote, compared to 29 percent for the biplane and 20 percent for the piggy bank). Thus, the sack of money became the first new token added to the game since the early 1950s. In 1999, Hasbro renamed the <a href="Rich%20Uncle%20Pennybags">Rich Uncle Pennybags</a> mascot "Mr. Monopoly", and released Star Wars: Episode I, Pokémon and Millennium editions of Monopoly. A second European edition is released in 1999, this time using the Euro as currency, but incorrectly listing Geneva as the capital of Switzerland.

A 65th Anniversary Edition was released in a variation of the white box in 2000. In 2001, the European Edition is reissued, correcting the mistake of the 1999 printing, and correctly listing Bern as the capital of Switzerland. In 2005, a 70th Anniversary Edition was released in a silver-metallic tin with a plastic slip case. Also starting in 2005, various "Here & Now" editions were released in multiple countries. The first release of this edition was for the UK market, and its success led to the selection of properties for a U.S. edition by online vote. The most popular properties were released on the U.S. "Here & Now" edition board in 2006. This, in turn, led to a worldwide "Here & Now" edition (released in 2008), along with other national editions (including a second UK "Here and Now" edition) with properties selected by online vote. The main principle of the "Here & Now" editions was "What if Monopoly had been invented today?"

The first changes to the gameplay of the "Monopoly" game itself occurred with the publication of both the "Monopoly Here & Now Electronic Banking Edition" by Hasbro UK and "Monopoly: The Mega Edition" by <a href="Winning%20Moves">Winning Moves Games</a> in 2006. The Electronic Banking Edition uses <a href="Visa%20Inc.">VISA</a>-branded debit cards and a debit card reader for monetary transactions, instead of paper bills. This edition is available in the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Ireland. A version was released in the U.S. in 2007, albeit without the co-branding by Visa. An electronic counter had been featured in the Stock Exchange editions released in Europe in the early 2000s (decade), and is also a feature of the "Monopoly City" board game released in 2009.

The Mega Edition has been expanded to include fifty-two spaces (with more street names taken from Atlantic City), skyscrapers (to be played after hotels), train depots, the 1000 denomination of play money, as well as "bus tickets" and a <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29%23Speed%20Die">speed die</a>. Shortly after the release of "Mega Monopoly" in 2006, Hasbro adopted the same blue version of the speed die into a special "Speed Die Edition" of the game. By 2008, the die, now red, became a permanent addition to the game, though its use remains optional there. In 2009's "Championship Edition", use of the speed die is mandatory, as it also became mandatory in most of 2009's "Monopoly" tournaments.

In addition to permanently adding the speed die in 2008, Hasbro also instituted further changes to the United States standard edition of the board, including making Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues a brown color group, making the Income Tax space a flat $200 (removing the 10% option), changing the colors on the GO space from red to black, increasing the Luxury Tax to $100 (from $75), and changing certain of the Community Chest and Chance cards. The changes in these four areas made the U.S. standard edition more uniform with the UK and modern European editions. In 2009, Winning Moves Games introduced "The Classic Edition", with a pre-2008 game board and cards, re-inclusion of the "<a href="sack%20of%20money">sack of money</a>" playing piece, and a plain MONOPOLY logo in the center of the board, with neither the 1985 or 2008 version of "Mr. Monopoly" present. Also in 2009, "Monopoly" "theme packs" entered the retail market, including the Dog Lovers and Sports Fans editions, which include customized money, replacements for houses and hotels, and custom tokens, but no board.

In early 2010, Hasbro began selling the "Free Parking" and "Get out of Jail" add-on games, which can be played alone or when a player lands on the respective "Monopoly" board spaces. If played during a "Monopoly" game, success at either game gets the winning player a "free taxi ride to any space on the board" or "out of jail free", respectively. A new, customizable edition called "U-Build" is also released. Later in 2010, for the 75th anniversary of the game's publication, Hasbro released "Monopoly Revolution", giving the game a graphic redesign, as well as returning it to a round shape, which had not been seen since some of Darrow's 1930s custom-made sets. The game includes "bank cards" and keeps track of players' assets electronically, as was introduced in the "Electronic Banking Edition" earlier in the decade. The game also features clear plastic playing pieces for movers, and electronic sound effects, triggered by certain events (for instance, a "jail door slam" sound effect when a player goes to jail). "Monopoly Live" was announced at the New York Toy Fair in February, 2011. The "Monopoly Millionaire" version of the game was released in 2012.

In early 2013, a board game version of the "Monopoly Hotels" online game was released. From January 8 to February 5, 2013, through the "Monopoly" page on Facebook in a campaign called "Save Your Token", Hasbro took votes from the public to make another permanent change in the lineup of game tokens. The token with the lowest number of "Save Your Token" votes will be retired, and replaced with one of five other tokens, depending on which of the new candidates gets the most votes. The potential tokens were a robot, a helicopter, a cat, a guitar or a diamond ring. Neither the biplane nor the piggy bank from the 1998 vote are being considered this time. Early on February 6, it was announced that the iron would be retired for having received the fewest votes, and the cat would be replacing it, having received the most votes. Starting in February 2013, the U.S. discount chain Target began selling a "Golden Token" set with the eight classic tokens and all five candidates. Special editions with the thirteen golden tokens have also been released in the UK and France. The first Monopoly game to have the new token lineup was released in June 2013. In 2015, the game celebrated its 80th anniversary with eight tokens from each decade in a special edition.

The first "Monopoly" tournaments were suggested by Victor Watson of Waddington after the <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship%201972">World Chess Championship 1972</a>. Such championships are also held for players of the board game "<a href="Scrabble">Scrabble</a>". The first European Championship was held in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, the same site as the 1972 World Chess Championship. Accounts differ as to the eventual winner: Philip Orbanes and Victor Watson name John Mair, representing Ireland and the eventual World "Monopoly" Champion of 1975, as also having won the European Championship. <a href="Gyles%20Brandreth">Gyles Brandreth</a>, himself a later European "Monopoly" Champion, names Pierre Milet, representing France, as the European Champion. One of the reasons there may be differing accounts of the eventual winner is attributable to a minor controversy with the final game. According to Parker Brothers' Randolph "Ranny" P. Barton, an error was made by one of the participants and a protest was filed by an opponent. The judges (Barton, Watson, and a representative from <a href="Miro%20Company">Miro</a>, the French publishers of Monopoly) weighed the options of starting the final game over and delaying the chartered plane that would take them home from Iceland vs allowing the game to stand with the error but allowing them to make their flight. In the end, the judges upheld the result of the game with the error uncorrected.

Victor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding tournaments in the UK and US, respectively. World Champions were declared in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official World Champions by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus could be argued as the first international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975. Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> days after the conclusion of the European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.

By 1982, tournaments in the United States featured a competition between tournament winners in all 50 states, competing to become the United States Champion. National tournaments were held in the US and UK the year before World Championships through 2003–2004 but during the same year as of 2009 (see table, below). The determination of the US champion was changed for the 2003 tournament: winners of an <a href="Internet">Internet</a>-based quiz challenge were selected to compete, rather than one state champion for each of the 50 states. The tournaments are now typically held every six years. In the past, the US edition Monopoly board was used at the World championship level, while national variants are used at the national level. Since true international play began in 1975, no World champion has come from the US, still considered the board game's "birthplace". However, Dana Terman, two-time US Champion, placed second at the 1980 World Championship, Richard Marinaccio, the 2009 US Champion, placed third at the 2009 World Championship, and Brian Valentine, the 2015 US Representative, placed third at the 2015 World Championship.

Nicolò Falcone of Italy defeated players from 27 countries plus the defending champion in the 2015 World Championship held at The Venetian resort in <a href="Macau">Macau</a>.

The original hand made editions of the "Monopoly" game had been localized for the cities or areas in which it was played, and Parker Brothers has continued this practice. Their version of "Monopoly" has been produced for international markets, with the place names being localized for cities including <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and for countries including the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and Germany, among others. By 1982, Parker Brothers stated that the game "has been translated into over 15 languages...". In 2009, Hasbro reported that "Monopoly" is officially published in 27 languages, and has been licensed by them in 81 countries. In 2013, Hasbro stated that the game is now available in 43 languages and 111 countries.
The game has also inspired official spin-offs, such as the board game "<a href="Advance%20to%20Boardwalk">Advance to Boardwalk</a>" from 1985. There have been six card games: "<a href="Waterworks%20%28card%20game%29">Water Works</a>" from 1972, "<a href="Free%20Parking">Free Parking</a>" from 1988, "<a href="Express%20Monopoly">Express Monopoly</a>" from 1993, "" from 1999, "<a href="Monopoly%20Deal">Monopoly Deal</a>" from 2008 and "<a href="Monopoly%20Millionaire%20Deal">Monopoly Millionaire Deal</a>" from 2012. Finally, there have been two dice games: "<a href="Don%27t%20Go%20to%20Jail">Don't Go to Jail</a>" from 1991 and an update, "Monopoly Express", (2006–2007). A second product line of games and licenses exists in "<a href="Monopoly%20Junior">Monopoly Junior</a>", first published in 1990. In the late 1980s, official editions of "Monopoly" appeared for the <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Master System</a> and the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="Commodore%20128">Commodore 128</a>. A <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%20show%29">television game show</a>, produced by <a href="King%20World%20Productions">King World Productions</a>, was attempted in the summer of 1990, but lasted for only 12 episodes. In 1991–1992, official versions appeared for the <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> and Nintendo's <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">NES</a>, <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">SNES</a>, and <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a>. In 1995, as <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> (which had taken over <a href="Kenner">Kenner Parker</a> <a href="Tonka">Tonka</a> in 1991) was preparing to launch Hasbro Interactive as a new brand, they chose "Monopoly" and "<a href="Trivial%20Pursuit">Trivial Pursuit</a>" to be their first two CD-ROM games. The Monopoly CD-ROM game also allowed for play over the Internet. CD-ROM versions of the officially licensed "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" and <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup '98</a> editions also were released. Later CD-ROM exclusive spin-offs, "Monopoly Casino" and "<a href="Monopoly%20Tycoon">Monopoly Tycoon</a>", were also produced under license.

Various manufacturers of the game have created dozens of officially licensed versions, in which the names of the properties and other elements of the game are replaced by others according to the game's theme. The first such license was awarded in 1994, to the company that became USAopoly, starting with a San Diego edition of Monopoly and later including themes such as <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s, "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>", <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> characters, "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a>", "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>", various particular cities (such as <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>), states, colleges and universities, the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a>, <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a>, individual professional sports teams, and many others. USAopoly also sells special corporate editions of "Monopoly". Official corporate editions have been produced for <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a>, the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, <a href="FedEx">FedEx</a>, and <a href="United%20Parcel%20Service">UPS</a>, among others. In 1995, a second license was awarded to Winning Moves Games in Massachusetts. Winning Moves has produced a new board game and card games based on "Monopoly" in the United States. Winning Moves also produces official localized editions of the game in the UK, France, Germany and Australia. The "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a> 50th Anniversary Edition Monopoly" is a special case, having been originally produced by Winning Moves in the UK, and resold by USAopoly within the US. A third license was awarded in 2000 by Hasbro to Winning Solutions, Inc., which produces specialty deluxe editions mostly for sale by specialized retailers. Other licensed localized editions of the game are being published in Nigeria and The Netherlands, among other locations.

When creating some of the modern licensed editions, such as the "<a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>" and <a href="The%20Powerpuff%20Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> editions of "Monopoly", Hasbro included special variant rules to be played in the theme of the licensed property. <a href="Infogrames">Infogrames</a>, which has published a CD-ROM edition of "Monopoly", also includes the selection of "house rules" as a possible variant of play. <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>, which publishes current electronic versions of the game, such as for the <a href="Nintendo%20Wii">Nintendo Wii</a>, also includes the selection of certain house rules.

Unofficial versions of the game, which share some of the same playing features, but also incorporate changes so as not to infringe on copyrights, have been created by firms such as <a href="Late%20for%20the%20Sky%20Production%20Company">Late for the Sky Production Company</a> and Help on Board. These are done for smaller cities, sometimes as charity fundraisers, and some have been created for college and university campuses. Others have non-geographical themes such as Wine-opoly and Chocolate-opoly. There is also a version called "Make Your Own -OPOLY", which allows you to customize all the game equipment and rules to your liking.

Before the creation of Hasbro Interactive, and after its later sale to <a href="Infogrames">Infogrames</a>, official computer and video game versions have been made available on many platforms. In addition to the versions listed above, they have been produced for <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">GameCube</a>, <a href="IBM%20compatible">PC</a>, <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Sega%20Mega%20Drive">Sega Genesis</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, and <a href="Mobile%20game">mobile phones</a>. A version for <a href="Windows%20CE">Windows CE</a> was planned in 1999. A <a href="handheld%20electronic%20game">handheld electronic game</a> was first released in 1998 that allowed for one human player against up to three player-selected or randomly chosen AI "personalities" out of five. A <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> release (along with "<a href="Battleship%20%28game%29">Battleship</a>", "<a href="Boggle">Boggle</a>", and "<a href="Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a>") has been published (by Atari), as well as a stand-alone edition for the same console (by EA). In 2001, <a href="Stern%20%28game%20company%29">Stern Pinball, Inc.</a> released a <a href="pinball%20machine">pinball machine</a> version of Monopoly, designed by <a href="Pat%20Lawlor">Pat Lawlor</a>.

The official Parker Brothers rules and board remained largely unchanged from 1936 to 2008. <a href="Ralph%20Anspach">Ralph Anspach</a> argued against this during an on-air conversation with "The Monopoly Book" author <a href="Frank%20Brady%20%28writer%29">Maxine Brady</a> in 1975, calling it an end to "steady progress" and an impediment to progress. Several authors who have written about the board game have noted many of the "house rules" that have become common among players, although they do not appear in Parker Brothers' rules sheets. <a href="Gyles%20Brandreth">Gyles Brandreth</a> included a section titled "Monopoly Variations", <a href="Tim%20Moore%20%28writer%29">Tim Moore</a> notes several such rules used in his household in his Foreword, <a href="Philip%20Orbanes">Phil Orbanes</a> included his own section of variations, and Maxine Brady noted a few in her preface. Authors Noel Gunther and Richard Hutton published "Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place" in 1986, as a guide, per the cover, "to making "Monopoly" fun again", by introducing new variations of rules and strategies. R. Wayne Schmittberger, a former editor of "Games" magazine, acknowledged the work of Gunther and Hutton in his own 1992 guide "New Rules for Classic Games" (which includes several pages of Monopoly variations and suggestions that vary from the standard rules of the game).

Starting in 1974, Parker Brothers and its then corporate parent, <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a>, attempted to suppress publication of a game called "<a href="Anti-Monopoly">Anti-Monopoly</a>", designed by <a href="San%20Francisco%20State%20University">San Francisco State University</a> economics professor <a href="Ralph%20Anspach">Ralph Anspach</a> and first published the previous year. Anspach began to research the game's history, and argued that the copyrights and trademarks held by Parker Brothers should be nullified, as the game came out of the public domain. Among other things, Anspach discovered the empty 1933 Charles B. Darrow file at the United States Copyright Office, testimony from the "Inflation" game case that was settled out of court, and letters from Knapp Electric challenging Parker Brothers over "Monopoly". As the case went to trial in November 1976, Anspach produced testimony by many involved with the early development of the game, including Catherine and Willard Allphin, Dorothea Raiford and Charles Todd. Willard Allphin attempted to sell a version of the game to <a href="Milton%20Bradley%20Company">Milton Bradley</a> in 1931, and published an article about the game's early history in the UK in 1975. Raiford had helped Ruth Hoskins produce the early Atlantic City games. Even Daniel Layman was interviewed, and Darrow's widow was deposed. The presiding judge, Spencer Williams, originally ruled for Parker Brothers/General Mills in 1977, allowing the Monopoly trademark to stand, and allowing the companies to destroy copies of Anspach's "Anti-Monopoly". Anspach appealed.

In December 1979, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</a> ruled in favor of Professor Anspach, with an opinion that agreed with the facts about the game's history and differed from Parker Brothers' "official" account. The court also upheld a "purchasing motivation" test (described in the decision as a "Genericness Doctrine"), a "test by which the trademark was valid only if consumers, when they asked for a "Monopoly" game, meant that they wanted Parker Brothers' version...". This had the effect of potentially nullifying the "Monopoly" trademark, and the court returned the case to Judge Williams. Williams heard the case again in 1980, and in 1981 he again held for Parker Brothers. Anspach appealed again, and in August 1982 the appeals court again reversed. The case was then appealed by General Mills/Parker Brothers to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a>, which decided not to hear the case in February 1983, and denied a petition for rehearing in April. This allowed the appeals court's decision to stand and further allowed Anspach to resume publication of his game.

With the trademark nullified, the name "Monopoly" entered the public domain, where the naming of games was concerned, and a profusion of non-Parker-Brothers variants were published. Parker Brothers and other firms lobbied the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> and obtained a revision of the trademark laws. The case was finally settled in 1985, with "Monopoly" remaining a valid trademark of Parker Brothers, and Anspach assigning the "Anti-Monopoly" trademark to the company but retaining the ability to use it under license. Anspach received compensation for court costs and the destroyed copies of his game, as well as unspecified damages. He was allowed to resume publication with a legal disclaimer. Anspach later self-published a book about his research and legal fights with General Mills, Kenner Parker Toys, and Hasbro.

Parker Brothers/Hasbro now claims trademark rights to the name and its variants, and has asserted it against others such as the publishers of "<a href="Ghettopoly">Ghettopoly</a>". Professor Anspach assigned the "Anti-Monopoly" trademark back to Parker Brothers, and Hasbro now owns it. Anspach's game remains in print. The previous publishers were a company called Talicor, but the game is currently distributed and sold by University Games worldwide.

Various patents have existed on the game of "Monopoly" and its predecessors, such as "The Landlord's Game", but all have now expired. The specific graphics of the game board, cards, and pieces are protected by <a href="United%20States%20copyright%20law">copyright law</a> and trademark law, as is the specific wording of the game's rules.

Parker Brothers created a few accessories and licensed a few products shortly after it began publishing the game in 1935. These included a money pad and the first stock exchange add-on in 1936, a birthday card, and a song by <a href="Charles%20Tobias">Charles Tobias</a> (lyrics) and John Jacob Loeb (music). At the conclusion of the "Anti-Monopoly" case, Kenner Parker Toys began to seek trademarks on the design elements of Monopoly. It was at this time that the game's main logo was redesigned to feature "<a href="Rich%20Uncle%20Pennybags">Rich Uncle Pennybags</a>" (now "Mr. Monopoly") reaching out from the second "O" in the word Monopoly. To commemorate the game's 50th anniversary in 1985, the company commissioned artist Lou Brooks to redesign and illustrate the main logo as a red street sign-like banner, as well as the character Rich Uncle Pennybags reaching out of the "O". Brooks was also hired at the time to develop and illustrate the game's special "Commemorative Edition" embossed tin box packaging. The art was also carried over onto the more traditional cardboard game box which was revised for the anniversary.

All items stamped with the red MONOPOLY logo also feature the word "Brand" in small print. In the mid-1980s, after the success of the first "collector's tin anniversary edition" (for the 50th anniversary), an edition of the game was produced by the <a href="Franklin%20Mint">Franklin Mint</a>, the first edition to be published outside Parker Brothers. At about the same time, McDonald's started its first <a href="McDonald%27s%20Monopoly">"Monopoly" game promotions</a>, considered the company's most successful, which continue to the present. The twentieth such promotion was sponsored in 2012.

In recent years, the "Monopoly" brand has been licensed onto a line of <a href="slot%20machine">slot machine</a>s built by <a href="WMS%20Gaming">WMS Gaming</a> (first introduced in 1998, six models had been made by 2000, and over 20 by 2005). The slots were named "Most Innovative Gaming Product in 1999 and voted "most popular" in 2001. The brand has also been licensed onto instant-win <a href="lottery">lottery</a> tickets, and lines of 1:64 scale <a href="model%20car">model car</a>s produced by <a href="Johnny%20Lightning">Johnny Lightning</a>, which also included collectible game tokens. Other licenses have been issued for clothing and accessories, including a line of bathroom accessories. Licensee Winning Moves Games also had a Monopoly Calculator that could be used as a standard calculator, or used to aid in transactions during a game.
