Richard Feynman

Richard Phillips Feynman (; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American <a href="theoretical%20physicist">theoretical physicist</a>, known for his work in the <a href="path%20integral%20formulation">path integral formulation</a> of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, the theory of <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a>, and the physics of the <a href="superfluidity">superfluidity</a> of supercooled <a href="liquid%20helium">liquid helium</a>, as well as in <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> for which he proposed the <a href="parton%20model">parton model</a>. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with <a href="Julian%20Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a> and <a href="Shin%27ichir%C5%8D%20Tomonaga">Shin'ichirō Tomonaga</a>, received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1965.

Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s, which later became known as <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a>s. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal "<a href="Physics%20World">Physics World</a>" he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.

He assisted in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">development of the atomic bomb</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the <a href="Rogers%20Commission%20Report">Rogers Commission</a>, the panel that investigated the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">Space Shuttle "Challenger" disaster</a>. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computing</a> and introducing the concept of <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>. He held the <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a> <a href="Financial%20endowment%23Endowed%20professorships">professorship</a> in <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a> at the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called "<a href="There%27s%20Plenty%20of%20Room%20at%20the%20Bottom">There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a>" and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, "<a href="The%20Feynman%20Lectures%20on%20Physics">The Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books "<a href="Surely%20You%27re%20Joking%2C%20Mr.%20Feynman%21">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a>" and "<a href="What%20Do%20You%20Care%20What%20Other%20People%20Think%3F">What Do You Care What Other People Think?</a>" and books written about him such as "<a href="Tuva%20or%20Bust%21">Tuva or Bust!</a>" by <a href="Ralph%20Leighton">Ralph Leighton</a> and the biography "Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman" by <a href="James%20Gleick">James Gleick</a>.

Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, New York City, to Lucille , a <a href="Homemaking">homemaker</a>, and Melville Arthur Feynman, a sales manager originally from <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> in Belarus (then part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>). Both were <a href="Lithuanian%20Jews">Lithuanian Jews</a>. They were not religious, and by his youth, Feynman described himself as an "avowed <a href="atheism">atheist</a>". Many years later, in a letter to <a href="Tina%20Levitan">Tina Levitan</a>, declining a request for information for her book on Jewish Nobel Prize winners, he stated, "To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory", adding, "at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the <a href="chosen%20people">chosen people</a>'". Later in his life, during a visit to the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary</a>, he encountered the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> for the first time and remarked that it contained a medieval kind of reasoning and was a wonderful book.

Feynman was a <a href="Language%20delay">late talker</a>, and did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult he spoke with a <a href="New%20York%20accent">New York accent</a> strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration—so much so that his friends <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> and <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> once commented that Feynman spoke like a "bum". The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.

When Richard was five his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry Phillips, who died at age four weeks. Four years later, Richard's sister <a href="Joan%20Feynman">Joan</a> was born and the family moved to <a href="Far%20Rockaway">Far Rockaway</a>, Queens. Though separated by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the world. Though their mother thought women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan's interest in astronomy, and Joan eventually became an astrophysicist.

Feynman attended <a href="Far%20Rockaway%20High%20School">Far Rockaway High School</a>, a school in Far Rockaway, Queens, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates <a href="Burton%20Richter">Burton Richter</a> and <a href="Baruch%20Samuel%20Blumberg">Baruch Samuel Blumberg</a>. Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class. A high-school-administered IQ test estimated his <a href="Intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a> at 125—high, but "merely respectable" according to biographer <a href="James%20Gleick">James Gleick</a>. His sister Joan did better, allowing her to claim that she was smarter. Years later he declined to join <a href="Mensa%20International">Mensa International</a>, saying that his IQ was too low. Physicist <a href="Steve%20Hsu">Steve Hsu</a> stated of the test: 

When Feynman was 15, he taught himself <a href="trigonometry">trigonometry</a>, <a href="algebra">advanced algebra</a>, <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a>, <a href="analytic%20geometry">analytic geometry</a>, and both <a href="differential%20calculus">differential</a> and <a href="integral%20calculus">integral calculus</a>. Before entering college, he was experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as the <a href="half-derivative">half-derivative</a> using his own notation. He created special symbols for <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>, <a href="sine">sine</a>, <a href="cosine">cosine</a> and <a href="tangent%20%28trigonometry%29">tangent</a> functions so they did not look like three variables multiplied together, and for the <a href="derivative">derivative</a>, to remove the temptation of canceling out the d's. A member of the <a href="Arista%20%E2%80%93%20National%20Honor%20Society">Arista Honor Society</a>, in his last year in high school he won the <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> Math Championship. His habit of direct characterization sometimes rattled more conventional thinkers; for example, one of his questions, when learning <a href="feline%20anatomy">feline anatomy</a>, was "Do you have a map of the cat?" (referring to an anatomical chart).

Feynman applied to <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> but was not accepted because of their <a href="Jewish%20quota">quota for the number of Jews admitted</a>. Instead, he attended the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, where he joined the <a href="List%20of%20MIT%20fraternities%2C%20sororities%2C%20and%20ILGs%23Pi%20Lambda%20Phi">Pi Lambda Phi fraternity</a>. Although he originally majored in mathematics, he later switched to electrical engineering, as he considered mathematics to be too abstract. Noticing that he "had gone too far," he then switched to physics, which he claimed was "somewhere in between." As an undergraduate, he published two papers in the "<a href="Physical%20Review">Physical Review</a>". One of these, which was co-written with <a href="Manuel%20Vallarta">Manuel Vallarta</a>, was titled "The Scattering of Cosmic Rays by the Stars of a Galaxy". 

The other was his senior thesis, on "Forces in Molecules", based on an idea by <a href="John%20C.%20Slater">John C. Slater</a>, who was sufficiently impressed by the paper to have it published. Today, it is known as the <a href="Hellmann%E2%80%93Feynman%20theorem">Hellmann–Feynman theorem</a>.

In 1939, Feynman received a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>, and was named a <a href="Putnam%20Fellow">Putnam Fellow</a>. He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> in physics—an unprecedented feat—and an outstanding score in mathematics, but did poorly on the history and English portions. The head of the physics department there, <a href="Henry%20D.%20Smyth">Henry D. Smyth</a>, had another concern, writing to <a href="Philip%20M.%20Morse">Philip M. Morse</a> to ask: "Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but have to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small because of the difficulty of placing them." Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman's "physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic".

Attendees at Feynman's first seminar, which was on the classical version of the <a href="Wheeler-Feynman%20absorber%20theory">Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory</a>, included <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a>, and <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to quantize, and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity in <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, which <a href="Sir%20Fred%20Hoyle">Sir Fred Hoyle</a> and <a href="Jayant%20Narlikar">Jayant Narlikar</a> did much later as the <a href="Hoyle%E2%80%93Narlikar%20theory%20of%20gravity">Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity</a>. Feynman received a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a>. His doctoral thesis was titled "The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics". Feynman had applied the <a href="principle%20of%20stationary%20action">principle of stationary action</a> to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the <a href="Wheeler%E2%80%93Feynman%20absorber%20theory">Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory</a> of electrodynamics, and laid the groundwork for the <a href="path%20integral%20formulation">path integral formulation</a> and <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a>s. A key insight was that <a href="positron">positron</a>s behaved like <a href="electron">electron</a>s moving backwards in time. James Gleick wrote:
One of the conditions of Feynman's scholarship to Princeton was that he could not be married; nevertheless, he continued to see his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, and was determined to marry her once he had been awarded his Ph.D. despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. This was an incurable disease at the time, and she was not expected to live more than two years. On June 29, 1942, they took the <a href="Staten%20Island%20Ferry">ferry</a> to <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, where they were married in the city office. The ceremony was attended by neither family nor friends and was witnessed by a pair of strangers. Feynman could only kiss Arline on the cheek. After the ceremony he took her to <a href="Deborah%20Heart%20and%20Lung%20Center">Deborah Hospital</a>, where he visited her on weekends.

In 1941, with <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> raging in Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman spent the summer working on ballistics problems at the <a href="Frankford%20Arsenal">Frankford Arsenal</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. After the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by <a href="Robert%20R.%20Wilson">Robert R. Wilson</a>, who was working on means to produce <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> for use in an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, as part of what would become the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, intended to electromagnetically separate <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> from <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a>. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the <a href="calutron">calutron</a> that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, <a href="Ernest%20O.%20Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a>, at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a>. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and <a href="Paul%20Olum">Paul Olum</a> struggled to determine whether or not it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.

At this juncture, in early 1943, <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> was establishing the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, a secret laboratory on a <a href="mesa">mesa</a> in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> where atomic bombs would be designed and built. An offer was made to the Princeton team to be redeployed there. "Like a bunch of professional soldiers," Wilson later recalled, "we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos." Like many other young physicists, Feynman soon fell under the spell of the charismatic Oppenheimer, who telephoned Feynman long distance from Chicago to inform him that he had found a <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a> in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, for Arline. They were among the first to depart for New Mexico, leaving on a train on March 28, 1943. The railroad supplied Arline with a wheelchair, and Feynman paid extra for a private room for her.

At Los Alamos, Feynman was assigned to Hans Bethe's Theoretical (T) Division, and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader. He and Bethe developed the <a href="Bethe%E2%80%93Feynman%20formula">Bethe–Feynman formula</a> for calculating the yield of a <a href="Nuclear%20weapon%20design">fission bomb</a>, which built upon previous work by <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a>. As a junior physicist, he was not central to the project. He administered the computation group of <a href="human%20computer">human computer</a>s in the theoretical division. With <a href="Stanley%20Frankel">Stanley Frankel</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20Metropolis">Nicholas Metropolis</a>, he assisted in establishing a system for using <a href="IBM">IBM</a> <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s for computation. He invented a new method of computing <a href="Logarithm%23Calculation">logarithms</a> that he later used on the <a href="Connection%20Machine">Connection Machine</a>. Other work at Los Alamos included calculating <a href="neutron">neutron</a> equations for the Los Alamos "Water Boiler", a small <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality.

On completing this work, Feynman was sent to the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, where the Manhattan Project had its <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a> facilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so that <a href="criticality%20accident">criticality accident</a>s could be avoided, especially when <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> came into contact with water, which acted as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they would realize the dangers. He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of safety recommendations for the various grades of enrichments. He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos "could not be responsible for their safety otherwise".

Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman was put in charge of the group responsible for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed <a href="uranium%20hydride%20bomb">uranium hydride bomb</a>, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.

At Los Alamos, which was isolated for security, Feynman amused himself by investigating the combination locks on the cabinets and desks of physicists. He often found that they left the lock combinations on the factory settings, wrote the combinations down, or used easily guessable combinations like dates. He found one cabinet's combination by trying numbers he thought a physicist might use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of <a href="natural%20logarithm">natural logarithm</a>s, "<a href="e%20%28number%29">e</a>" = 2.71828 ...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept research notes all had the same combination. He left notes in the cabinets as a prank, spooking his colleague, <a href="Frederic%20de%20Hoffmann">Frederic de Hoffmann</a>, into thinking a spy had gained access to them.

Feynman's $380 monthly salary was about half the amount needed for his modest living expenses and Arline's medical bills, and they were forced to dip into her $3,300 in savings. On weekends he drove to Albuquerque to see Arline in a car borrowed from his friend <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs mentioned Feynman's safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque; Fuchs himself later confessed to spying for the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The <a href="FBI">FBI</a> would compile a bulky file on Feynman.

Informed that Arline was dying, Feynman drove to Albuquerque and sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He then immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the <a href="Trinity%20nuclear%20test">Trinity nuclear test</a>. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation. The immense brightness of the explosion made him duck to the truck's floor, where he saw a temporary "purple splotch" <a href="afterimage">afterimage</a>.

Feynman nominally held an appointment at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> as an assistant professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan Project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, "It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me."

As early as October 30, 1943, Bethe had written to the chairman of the physics department of his university, <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell</a>, to recommend that Feynman be hired. On February 28, 1944, this was endorsed by <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a>, also from Cornell, and one of the most senior scientists at Los Alamos. This led to an offer being made in August 1944, which Feynman accepted. Oppenheimer had also hoped to recruit Feynman to the University of California, but the head of the physics department, <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Birge">Raymond T. Birge</a>, was reluctant. He made Feynman an offer in May 1945, but Feynman turned it down. Cornell matched its salary offer of $3,900 per annum. Feynman became one of the first of the Los Alamos Laboratory's group leaders to depart, leaving for <a href="Ithaca%2C%20New%20York">Ithaca, New York</a>, in October 1945.

Because Feynman was no longer working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, he was no longer exempt from <a href="the%20draft">the draft</a>. At his induction physical Army psychiatrists diagnosed Feynman as suffering from a mental illness, and the Army gave him a <a href="Selective%20Service%20System%23Classifications">4-F exemption</a> on mental grounds. His father died suddenly on October 8, 1946, and Feynman suffered from depression. On October 17, 1946, he wrote a letter to Arline, expressing his deep love and heartbreak. The letter was sealed and only opened after his death. "Please excuse my not mailing this," the letter concluded, "but I don't know your new address." Unable to focus on research problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, <a href="Nutation">nutating</a> disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir <a href="William%20Rowan%20Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a> on <a href="quaternions">quaternions</a>, and attempted unsuccessfully to use them to formulate a <a href="special%20relativity">relativistic</a> theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
Feynman was not the only frustrated theoretical physicist in the early post-war years. <a href="Quantum%20electrodynamics">Quantum electrodynamics</a> suffered from <a href="infinity">infinite</a> integrals in <a href="perturbation%20theory">perturbation theory</a>. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had unsuccessfully attempted to work around. "Theoreticians", noted <a href="Murray%20Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a>, "were in disgrace." In June 1947, leading American physicists met at the <a href="Shelter%20Island%20Conference">Shelter Island Conference</a>. For Feynman, it was his "first big conference with big men ... I had never gone to one like this one in peacetime." The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of the <a href="Lamb%20shift">Lamb shift</a>, the measurement of the <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a> of the electron, and <a href="Robert%20Marshak">Robert Marshak</a>'s <a href="pi-meson">two-meson</a> hypothesis.

Bethe took the lead from the work of <a href="Hans%20Kramers">Hans Kramers</a>, and derived a <a href="renormalization">renormalized</a> non-relativistic quantum equation for the Lamb shift. The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he could do this, but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge. Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe's version. Feynman presented his work to his peers at the <a href="Pocono%20Conference">Pocono Conference</a> in 1948. It did not go well. <a href="Julian%20Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a> gave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, titled "Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics". The unfamiliar <a href="Feynman%20diagrams">Feynman diagrams</a>, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, and <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, Edward Teller and Niels Bohr all raised objections.

To <a href="Freeman%20Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>, one thing at least was clear: <a href="Shin%27ichir%C5%8D%20Tomonaga">Shin'ichirō Tomonaga</a>, Schwinger and Feynman understood what they were talking about even if no one else did, but had not published anything. He was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the "Physical Review" in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on "A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics" attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on "The Theory of Positrons" addressed the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a> and <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a>, and introduced what is now called the <a href="Feynman%20propagator">Feynman propagator</a>. Finally, in papers on the "Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction" in 1950 and "An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics" in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.

While papers by others initially cited Schwinger, papers citing Feynman and employing Feynman diagrams appeared in 1950, and soon became prevalent. Students learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created. Computer programs were later written to compute Feynman diagrams, providing a tool of unprecedented power. It is possible to write such programs because the Feynman diagrams constitute a <a href="formal%20language">formal language</a> with a <a href="formal%20grammar">formal grammar</a>. <a href="Marc%20Kac">Marc Kac</a> provided the formal proofs of the summation under history, showing that the parabolic <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a> can be re-expressed as a sum under different histories (that is, an expectation operator), what is now known as the <a href="Feynman%E2%80%93Kac%20formula">Feynman–Kac formula</a>, the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications of stochastic processes. To Schwinger, however, the Feynman diagram was "pedagogy, not physics."

By 1949, Feynman was becoming restless at Cornell. He never settled into a particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends "until these arrangements became sexually volatile." He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he was always in the shadow of Hans Bethe. Despite all of this, Feynman looked back favorably on the <a href="Telluride%20House">Telluride House</a>, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains." He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that "it's there that I did the fundamental work" for which he won the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize</a>.

Feynman spent several weeks in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in July 1949. That year, the Soviet Union <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">detonated</a> its <a href="RDS-1">first atomic bomb</a>, generating anti-communist hysteria. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950 and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist <a href="David%20Bohm">David Bohm</a> was arrested on December 4, 1950 and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. A girlfriend told Feynman that he should also consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951–52, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the <a href="Centro%20Brasileiro%20de%20Pesquisas%20F%C3%ADsicas">Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas</a>. In Brazil, Feynman was impressed with "<a href="samba">samba</a>" music, and learned to play a metal percussion instrument, the "<a href="Frying%20pan%23Music">frigideira</a>". He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his friend Bohm but Bohm could not convince Feynman to investigate Bohm's ideas on physics.

Feynman did not return to Cornell. Bacher, who had been instrumental in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> (Caltech). Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from <a href="Neodesha%2C%20Kansas">Neodesha, Kansas</a>. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a>, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by his violent temper. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">Oppenheimer security hearing</a> ("Where there's smoke there's fire") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of "extreme cruelty". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.

In the wake of the 1957 <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, the US government's interest in science rose for a time. Feynman was considered for a seat on the <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">President's Science Advisory Committee</a>, but was not appointed. At this time, the FBI interviewed a woman close to Feynman, possibly Mary Lou, who sent a written statement to <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> on August 8, 1958:

The government nevertheless sent Feynman to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> for the September 1958 <a href="Atoms%20for%20Peace">Atoms for Peace</a> Conference. On the beach at <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from <a href="Ripponden">Ripponden</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, and working in Switzerland as an "au pair". Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his <a href="Albert%20Einstein%20Award">Albert Einstein Award</a> medal and, on the advice of an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and blackmailed him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 a week to be his live-in maid. Feynman knew that this sort of behavior was illegal under the <a href="Mann%20Act">Mann Act</a>, so he had a friend, <a href="Matthew%20Sands">Matthew Sands</a>, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in <a href="Altadena%2C%20California">Altadena, California</a>, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men, but Feynman proposed in early 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the <a href="The%20Langham%20Huntington%2C%20Pasadena">Huntington Hotel</a> in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a>. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.

Feynman tried <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a> and <a href="ketamine">ketamine</a> at <a href="John%20C.%20Lilly">John Lilly</a>'s famed <a href="Isolation%20tank">sensory deprivation</a> tanks, as a way of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain. Despite his curiosity about hallucinations, he was reluctant to experiment with <a href="LSD">LSD</a>.

At Caltech, Feynman investigated the physics of the <a href="superfluid">superfluid</a>ity of supercooled <a href="liquid%20helium">liquid helium</a>, where helium seems to display a complete lack of <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> when flowing. Feynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist <a href="Lev%20Landau">Lev Landau</a>'s theory of superfluidity. Applying the Schrödinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale. This helped with the problem of <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a>, but the solution eluded Feynman. It was solved with the <a href="BCS%20theory">BCS theory</a> of superconductivity, proposed by <a href="John%20Bardeen">John Bardeen</a>, <a href="Leon%20Neil%20Cooper">Leon Neil Cooper</a>, and <a href="John%20Robert%20Schrieffer">John Robert Schrieffer</a> in 1957.
Feynman, inspired by a desire to quantize the <a href="Wheeler%E2%80%93Feynman%20absorber%20theory">Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory</a> of electrodynamics, laid the groundwork for the <a href="path%20integral%20formulation">path integral formulation</a> and <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a>s.

With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman developed a model of <a href="weak%20decay">weak decay</a>, which showed that the current coupling in the process is a combination of vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an <a href="antineutrino">antineutrino</a>). Although <a href="E.%20C.%20George%20Sudarshan">E. C. George Sudarshan</a> and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with <a href="Murray%20Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> was seen as seminal because the <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a> was neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> theory of <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> with an explanation of <a href="parity%20violation">parity violation</a>.

Feynman attempted an explanation, called the <a href="parton%20model">parton model</a>, of the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a>s governing nucleon scattering. The parton model emerged as a complement to the <a href="quark%20model">quark model</a> developed by Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as "put-ons". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles; the statistics of the <a href="omega-minus%20particle">omega-minus particle</a>, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

The <a href="SLAC%20National%20Accelerator%20Laboratory">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> <a href="deep%20inelastic%20scattering">deep inelastic scattering</a> experiments of the late 1960s showed that <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the <a href="gluon">gluon</a>s that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.

After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field and derived the <a href="Einstein%20field%20equation">Einstein field equation</a> of general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, "ghosts", which are "particles" in the interior of his diagrams that have the "wrong" connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the <a href="Yang%E2%80%93Mills">Yang–Mills</a> theories, for example, <a href="quantum%20chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a> and the <a href="electro-weak">electro-weak</a> theory. He did work on all four of the forces of nature: <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic</a>, the <a href="weak%20force">weak force</a>, the <a href="strong%20force">strong force</a> and gravity. John and Mary Gribbin state in their book on Feynman that "Nobody else has made such influential contributions to the investigation of all four of the interactions".

Partly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by <a href="William%20McLellan%20%28nanotechnology%29">William McLellan</a> and the other by <a href="Tom%20Newman%20%28scientist%29">Tom Newman</a>. He was also one of the first scientists to conceive the possibility of <a href="quantum%20computer">quantum computer</a>s. In 1984–1986, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (<a href="variational%20perturbation%20theory">variational perturbation theory</a>) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of <a href="critical%20exponent">critical exponent</a>s measured in satellite experiments.

In the early 1960s, Feynman acceded to a request to "spruce up" the teaching of undergraduates at Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that later became "<a href="The%20Feynman%20Lectures%20on%20Physics">The Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>". He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. "The Feynman Lectures on Physics" occupied two physicists, <a href="Robert%20B.%20Leighton">Robert B. Leighton</a> and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including "The Character of Physical Law", "", "Statistical Mechanics", "Lectures on Gravitation", and the "Feynman Lectures on Computation".

Feynman wrote about his experiences teaching physics undergraduates in Brazil. The students' study habits and the Portuguese language textbooks were so devoid of any context or applications for their information that, in Feynman's opinion, the students were not learning physics at all. At the end of the year, Feynman was invited to give a lecture on his teaching experiences, and he agreed to do so, provided he could speak frankly, which he did.
Feynman opposed <a href="rote%20learning">rote learning</a> or unthinking memorization and other teaching methods that emphasized form over function. "Clear thinking" and "clear presentation" were fundamental prerequisites for his attention. It could be perilous even to approach him unprepared, and he did not forget fools and pretenders. In 1964, he served on the California State Curriculum Commission, which was responsible for approving textbooks to be used by schools in California. He was not impressed with what he found. Many of the mathematics texts covered subjects of use only to pure mathematicians as part of the "<a href="New%20Math">New Math</a>". Elementary students were taught about <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">sets</a>, but:

In April 1966, Feynman delivered an address to the <a href="National%20Science%20Teachers%20Association">National Science Teachers Association</a>, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate "<a href="ab%20initio">ab initio</a>", from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.

In 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of "<a href="cargo%20cult%20science">cargo cult science</a>", which has the semblance of science, but is only <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> due to a lack of "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that."

Feynman served as doctoral advisor to 31 students.

In the 1960s, Feynman began thinking of writing an autobiography, and he began granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with <a href="Ralph%20Leighton">Ralph Leighton</a> (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on <a href="tape%20recorder">audio tape</a> that Ralph transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as "<a href="Surely%20You%27re%20Joking%2C%20Mr.%20Feynman%21">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a>" and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought a new wave of protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged <a href="sexism">sexism</a> in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that <a href="Jenijoy%20La%20Belle">Jenijoy La Belle</a>, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had got to know La Belle and both liked and admired her.

Gell-Mann was upset by Feynman's account in the book of the weak interaction work, and threatened to sue, resulting in a correction being inserted in later editions. This incident was just the latest provocation in decades of bad feeling between the two scientists. Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received; he remarked: "[Feynman] was a great scientist, but he spent a great deal of his effort generating anecdotes about himself." He noted that Feynman's eccentricities included a refusal to brush his teeth, which he advised on national television that others not do, despite dentists showing him scientific studies that supported the practice.

When invited to join the <a href="Rogers%20Commission">Rogers Commission</a>, which investigated the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">"Challenger" disaster</a>, Feynman was hesitant. Washington, D.C., he told his wife, was "a great big world of mystery to me, with tremendous forces." But she convinced him to go, saying he might discover something others overlooked. Because Feynman did not balk at blaming NASA for the disaster, he clashed with the politically savvy commission chairman William Rogers, a former Secretary of State. During a break in one hearing, Rogers told commission member <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>, "Feynman is becoming a pain in the ass." During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's <a href="O-ring">O-ring</a>s became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a>.

Feynman devoted the latter half of his book "<a href="What%20Do%20You%20Care%20What%20Other%20People%20Think%3F">What Do You Care What Other People Think?</a>" to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the Shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the Space Shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit <a href="Christa%20McAuliffe">Christa McAuliffe</a> into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."

The first public recognition of Feynman's work came in 1954, when <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>, the chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) notified him that he had won the Albert Einstein Award, which was worth $15,000 and came with a gold medal. Because of Strauss's actions in stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance, Feynman was reluctant to accept the award, but <a href="Isidor%20Isaac%20Rabi">Isidor Isaac Rabi</a> cautioned him: "You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him." It was followed by the AEC's <a href="Ernest%20Orlando%20Lawrence%20Award">Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award</a> in 1962. Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman shared the 1965 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> "for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles". He was elected a <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201965">Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1965</a>, received the <a href="Oersted%20Medal">Oersted Medal</a> in 1972, and the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Science">National Medal of Science</a> in 1979. He was elected a member of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>, but ultimately resigned and is no longer listed by them.

In 1978, Feynman sought medical treatment for abdominal pains and was diagnosed with <a href="liposarcoma">liposarcoma</a>, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor the size of a football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the <a href="UCLA%20Medical%20Center">UCLA Medical Center</a> on February3, 1988. A ruptured <a href="duodenal%20ulcer">duodenal ulcer</a> caused <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a>, and he declined to undergo the <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a> that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin <a href="Frances%20Lewine">Frances Lewine</a>, he died on February15, 1988, at age 69.

When Feynman was nearing death, he asked <a href="Danny%20Hillis">Danny Hillis</a> why he was so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that this sometimes bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.

Near the end of his life, Feynman attempted to visit the <a href="Tuvan%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Tuvan ASSR</a> in Russia, a dream thwarted by Cold War bureaucratic issuesthe letter from the Soviet government authorizing the trip was not received until the day after he died. His daughter Michelle later undertook the journey. His burial was at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in <a href="Altadena">Altadena</a>. His <a href="last%20words">last words</a> were: "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring."

Aspects of Feynman's life have been portrayed in various media. Feynman was portrayed by <a href="Matthew%20Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a> in the 1996 biopic "<a href="Infinity%20%28film%29">Infinity</a>". Actor <a href="Alan%20Alda">Alan Alda</a> commissioned playwright Peter Parnell to write a two-character play about a fictional day in the life of Feynman set two years before Feynman's death. The play, "<a href="QED%20%28play%29">QED</a>", premiered at the <a href="Mark%20Taper%20Forum">Mark Taper Forum</a> in Los Angeles in 2001 and was later presented at the <a href="Vivian%20Beaumont%20Theater">Vivian Beaumont Theater</a> on Broadway, with both presentations starring Alda as Richard Feynman. <a href="Real%20Time%20Opera">Real Time Opera</a> premiered its opera "Feynman" at the Norfolk (CT) Chamber Music Festival in June 2005. In 2011, Feynman was the subject of a biographical <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> entitled simply "Feynman", written by <a href="Jim%20Ottaviani">Jim Ottaviani</a> and illustrated by <a href="Leland%20Myrick">Leland Myrick</a>. In 2013, Feynman's role on the Rogers Commission was dramatised by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in "<a href="The%20Challenger">The Challenger</a>" (US title: "The Challenger Disaster"), with <a href="William%20Hurt">William Hurt</a> playing Feynman. In the 2016 book, "Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People", it states that one of the things Feynman often said was that "peace of mind is the most important prerequisite for creative work." Feynman felt one should do everything possible to achieve that peace of mind.

Feynman is commemorated in various ways. On May 4, 2005, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> issued the "American Scientists" commemorative set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations. The scientists depicted were Richard Feynman, <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, <a href="Barbara%20McClintock">Barbara McClintock</a>, and <a href="Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a>. Feynman's stamp, sepia-toned, features a photograph of a 30-something Feynman and eight small Feynman diagrams. The stamps were designed by <a href="Victor%20Stabin">Victor Stabin</a> under the artistic direction of Carl T. Herrman. The main building for the Computing Division at <a href="Fermilab">Fermilab</a> is named the "Feynman Computing Center" in his honor. A photograph of Richard Feynman giving a lecture was part of the 1997 poster series commissioned by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> for their "<a href="Think%20Different">Think Different</a>" advertising campaign. The <a href="Sheldon%20Cooper">Sheldon Cooper</a> character in "<a href="The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>" is a Feynman fan who emulates him by playing the bongo drums. On January 27, 2016, <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> wrote an article "The Best Teacher I Never Had" describing Feynman's talents as a teacher which inspired Gates to create <a href="Project%20Tuva">Project Tuva</a> to place the videos of Feynman's <a href="Messenger%20Lectures">Messenger Lectures</a>, "<a href="The%20Character%20of%20Physical%20Law">The Character of Physical Law</a>", on a website for public viewing. In 2015 Gates made a video on why he thought Feynman was special. The video was made for the 50th anniversary of Feynman's 1965 Nobel Prize, in response to Caltech's request for thoughts on Feynman.


"<a href="The%20Feynman%20Lectures%20on%20Physics">The Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>" is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics, compiled from lectures to <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> undergraduates in 1961–1964. As news of the lectures' lucidity grew, professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen. Co-authors <a href="Robert%20B.%20Leighton">Robert B. Leighton</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Sands">Matthew Sands</a>, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form. The work has endured and is useful to this day. They were edited and supplemented in 2005 with "Feynman's Tips on Physics: A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physics" by Michael Gottlieb and <a href="Ralph%20Leighton">Ralph Leighton</a> (Robert Leighton's son), with support from <a href="Kip%20Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> and other physicists.

Ringo Starr

Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on an album, including "<a href="With%20a%20Little%20Help%20from%20My%20Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>", "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">Yellow Submarine</a>", "<a href="Good%20Night%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Good Night</a>", and their <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> of "<a href="Act%20Naturally">Act Naturally</a>". He also wrote the Beatles' songs "<a href="Don%27t%20Pass%20Me%20By">Don't Pass Me By</a>" and "<a href="Octopus%27s%20Garden">Octopus's Garden</a>", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including "<a href="What%20Goes%20On%20%28Beatles%20song%29">What Goes On</a>" and "<a href="Flying%20%28Beatles%20instrumental%29">Flying</a>".

Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK <a href="skiffle">skiffle</a> craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> group, <a href="Rory%20Storm%23Rory%20Storm%20and%20the%20Hurricanes">Rory Storm and the Hurricanes</a>. After achieving moderate success in the UK and <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing <a href="Pete%20Best">Pete Best</a>.

Starr played key roles in <a href="The%20Beatles%20in%20film">the Beatles' films</a> and appeared in numerous others. After <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">the band's break-up</a> in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit "<a href="It%20Don%27t%20Come%20Easy">It Don't Come Easy</a>", and number ones "<a href="Photograph%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20song%29">Photograph</a>" and "<a href="You%27re%20Sixteen">You're Sixteen</a>". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "<a href="Back%20Off%20Boogaloo">Back Off Boogaloo</a>", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album "<a href="Ringo%20%28album%29">Ringo</a>", which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme "<a href="Thomas%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Thomas & Friends</a>" and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the first season of the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> children's television series "<a href="Shining%20Time%20Station">Shining Time Station</a>". Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of <a href="Ringo%20Starr%20%26amp%3B%20His%20All-Starr%20Band">Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band</a>.

Starr's musicianship has received praise from other drummers, including <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a> and <a href="Journey%20%28band%29">Journey</a>'s <a href="Steve%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Steve Smith</a>. He was inducted into the "<a href="Modern%20Drummer">Modern Drummer</a>" Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once. He is the richest drummer in the world with a net worth of US$350 million. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in the <a href="2018%20New%20Year%20Honours">2018 New Year Honours</a> for services to music.

Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street, in <a href="Dingle%2C%20Liverpool">Dingle, Liverpool</a>. He was the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1913–1981) and Elsie Gleave (1914–1987). Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of <a href="Swing%20%28dance%29">swing</a>. Prior to the birth of their son – whom they nicknamed "Ritchie" – the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth. Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, "Big Ritchie", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.

In an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, <a href="10%20Admiral%20Grove">Admiral Grove</a>; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year. Starkey later stated that he has "no real memories" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter. Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.
At age six Starkey developed <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. Following a routine <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a> he contracted <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a>, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at <a href="Sefton%20Park">Sefton Park</a>. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift <a href="percussion%20mallet">mallet</a> made from a cotton <a href="bobbin">bobbin</a> that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the <a href="Alyn%20Ainsworth">Alyn Ainsworth</a> song "Bedtime for Drums" as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: "I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums."

Starkey attended St Silas, a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him "<a href="Lazarus%20of%20Bethany">Lazarus</a>", and later <a href="University%20Academy%20Liverpool">Dingle Vale</a> <a href="Secondary%20modern%20school">Secondary modern school</a>, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics. As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the <a href="Eleven%20plus%20exam">11-plus</a> qualifying examination required for attendance at a <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>. On 17 April 1954, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves at the register office on Mount Pleasant, Liverpool. He was an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of <a href="big%20band">big band</a> music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by <a href="Dinah%20Shore">Dinah Shore</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Vaughan">Sarah Vaughan</a> and <a href="Billy%20Daniels">Billy Daniels</a>. Graves stated that he and "Ritchie" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: "He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry." After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks.

Beatles biographer <a href="Bob%20Spitz">Bob Spitz</a> described Starkey's upbringing as "a <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickensian</a> chronicle of misfortune". Houses in the area were "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse." Crawford commented: "Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." The children who lived there spent much of their time at <a href="Princes%20Park%2C%20Liverpool">Princes Park</a>, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: "You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way."

After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to <a href="skiffle">skiffle</a>, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.

Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: "I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs." The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the <a href="Clayton%20Square%20Shopping%20Centre">Clayton Squares</a> after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as "<a href="Rock%20Island%20Line%20%28song%29">Rock Island Line</a>" and "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a <a href="thimble">thimble</a> across a <a href="washboard%20%28musical%20instrument%29">washboard</a>, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.

On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>, <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a> and a makeshift <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a> fashioned from a <a href="waste%20container">rubbish bin</a> lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> became popular in the UK.

In November 1959, Starkey joined <a href="Rory%20Storm">Al Caldwell</a>'s Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as "Starr Time".

By early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands. In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a <a href="Butlins">Butlins</a> holiday camp in Wales. Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement. The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> bases in France about which Starr commented: "The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them." The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins. They eventually accepted, joining <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> at <a href="Bruno%20Koschmider">Bruno Koschmider</a>s <a href="Kaiserkeller">Kaiserkeller</a> on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band. Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay. Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>/<a href="DuBose%20Heyward">DuBose Heyward</a> <a href="aria">aria</a> "<a href="Summertime%20%28George%20Gershwin%20song%29">Summertime</a>". During Starr's first stay in Hamburg he also met <a href="Tony%20Sheridan">Tony Sheridan</a>, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.

Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins. On 14 August, Starr accepted Lennon's invitation to join the Beatles. On 16 August, Beatles manager <a href="Brian%20Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> fired their drummer, <a href="Pete%20Best">Pete Best</a>, who recalled: "He said 'I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.' He said [Beatles producer] <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a> wasn't too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn't fit in." Starr first performed as a member of the Beatles on 18 August 1962, at a <a href="horticultural%20society">horticultural society</a> dance at <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a>. After his appearance at the <a href="The%20Cavern%20Club">Cavern Club</a> the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting "Pete forever! Ringo never!" Harrison received a black eye from one upset fan, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard.

Starr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he "was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four piece band". For their second recording session with Starr, on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer <a href="Andy%20White%20%28drummer%29">Andy White</a> while recording takes for what would be the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">two sides</a> of the Beatles' first single, "<a href="Love%20Me%20Do">Love Me Do</a>", backed with "<a href="P.S.%20I%20Love%20You%20%28Beatles%20song%29">P.S. I Love You</a>". Starr played tambourine on "Love Me Do" and maracas on "P.S. I Love You". Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: "That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me." Martin later clarified: "I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks."

By November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing. He began receiving an amount of <a href="fan%20mail">fan mail</a> equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same "wavelength" as the other Beatles: "I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people as well as a drummer." He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, <a href="Northern%20Songs">Northern Songs</a>, but derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: "I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party." Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received praise for his skills.

During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, "<a href="Please%20Please%20Me%20%28song%29">Please Please Me</a>", followed "Love Me Do" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on "<a href="Thank%20Your%20Lucky%20Stars%20%28TV%20series%29">Thank Your Lucky Stars</a>" earned favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play. By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as <a href="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a> had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>" to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: "In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads." He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including <a href="Penny%20Valentine">Penny Valentine</a>'s "<a href="I%20Want%20To%20Kiss%20Ringo%20Goodbye">I Want To Kiss Ringo Goodbye</a>" and <a href="Rolf%20Harris">Rolf Harris</a>'s "<a href="Ringo%20for%20President">Ringo for President</a>".

In 1964, "I love Ringo" lapel pins were the bestselling Beatles merchandise. The prominent placing of the <a href="Ludwig%20Drums">Ludwig</a> logo on the bass drum of his American import drum kit gave the company such a burst of publicity that it became the dominant drum manufacturer in North America for the next twenty years. During live performances, the Beatles continued the "Starr Time" routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28film%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>", Starr garnered praise from critics, who considered his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director <a href="Richard%20Lester">Richard Lester</a> because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night; Starr commented: "Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line." Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to "the little man's quaintness". After the release of the Beatles' second feature film, "<a href="Help%21%20%28film%29">Help!</a>" (1965), Starr won a "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.

During an interview with "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: "[Best] took little pills to make him ill". Soon after, Best filed a <a href="libel">libel</a> suit against him that lasted four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand; before the start of the tour, Starr was stricken with a high-grade fever, <a href="pharyngitis">pharyngitis</a> and <a href="tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>, and briefly stayed in a local hospital, followed by several days of recuperation at home. He was temporarily replaced for five concerts by 24-year-old session drummer <a href="Jimmie%20Nicol">Jimmie Nicol</a>. Starr was discharged from the hospital and rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later said that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, when the Beatles were introduced to American songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette he offered them, whereas the others were hesitant.

On 11 February 1965, Starr married <a href="Maureen%20Starkey%20Tigrett">Maureen Cox</a>, whom he had met in 1962. By this time the stress and pressure of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to defend against would-be assassins. The constant pressure affected the Beatles' performances; Starr commented: "We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it." He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent hours playing cards with their road manager <a href="Neil%20Aspinall">Neil Aspinall</a> and roadie <a href="Mal%20Evans">Mal Evans</a> while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in "Melody Maker", a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: "[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album".

In August 1966, the Beatles released "<a href="Revolver%20%28Beatles%20album%29">Revolver</a>", their seventh UK LP. It included the song "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">Yellow Submarine</a>", the only British number-one single with Starr as the lead singer. Later that month, owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco <a href="Candlestick%20Park">Candlestick Park</a>. Starr commented: "We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone." By December, he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in <a href="Saint%20George%27s%20Hill">Saint George's Hill</a> called Sunny Heights. Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors, stereo equipment, a <a href="billiard%20table">billiard table</a>, <a href="go-kart">go-kart</a> track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: "When we don't record, I don't play."

For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>", Starr sang lead vocals on the <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">Lennon–McCartney</a> composition "<a href="With%20a%20Little%20Help%20from%20My%20Friends">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>". Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with "Sgt. Pepper", the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band; he commented: "[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his downtime, Starr worked on his guitar playing, and said: "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".

Epstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: "[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who we've relied on in the business, where we never got involved." Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, "<a href="Magical%20Mystery%20Tour%20%28film%29">Magical Mystery Tour</a>". Starr's growing interest in photography led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by that of McCartney. In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the others. He sang the <a href="Buck%20Owens">Buck Owens</a> hit "<a href="Act%20Naturally">Act Naturally</a>", and performed a duet with <a href="Cilla%20Black">Cilla Black</a>, "Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?" on her <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> television programme, "Cilla".

In November 1968, <a href="Apple%20Records">Apple Records</a> released "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">The Beatles</a>", commonly known as the "White Album". The album was partly inspired by the band's recent interactions with the <a href="Maharishi%20Mahesh%20Yogi">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>. While attending the Maharish's intermediate course at his <a href="ashram">ashram</a> in <a href="Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a>, India, they enjoyed one of <a href="The%20Beatles%20in%20India">their most prolific writing periods</a>, composing most of the album there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, "<a href="Don%27t%20Pass%20Me%20By">Don't Pass Me By</a>". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the Beatles deteriorated; at times only one or two members were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's <a href="passive-aggressive%20behaviour">passive-aggressive behaviour</a>, exacerbated by Starr's resentment of the near-constant presence of Lennon's wife, <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a>. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the Beatles for two weeks, holidaying with his family in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> on a boat loaned by actor <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat; a conversation with the ship's captain about the animal inspired Starr's "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>" composition "<a href="Octopus%27s%20Garden">Octopus's Garden</a>", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.

Despite a temporary return to congeniality during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles' fourth feature film, "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%281970%20film%29">Let It Be</a>", and its <a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">accompanying LP</a>, further strained band relationships. On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> for a mixing session for "<a href="I%20Want%20You%20%28She%27s%20So%20Heavy%29">I Want You</a>". At a business meeting on 20 September, Lennon told the others that he had quit the Beatles, although <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">the band's break-up</a> would not become public knowledge until McCartney's announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was also leaving.

Shortly before McCartney announced his exit from the Beatles in April 1970, he and Starr fell out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his <a href="McCartney%20%28album%29">eponymous solo album</a> to allow for Starr's debut, "<a href="Sentimental%20Journey%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20album%29">Sentimental Journey</a>", and the Beatles' "Let It Be". Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Gibb">Maurice Gibb</a>, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed "Sentimental Journey" with the country-inspired "<a href="Beaucoups%20of%20Blues">Beaucoups of Blues</a>", engineered by <a href="Scotty%20Moore">Scotty Moore</a> and featuring renowned <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> session musician <a href="Pete%20Drake">Pete Drake</a>. Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a <a href="%23Film%20career">film actor</a>.

Starr played drums on Lennon's "<a href="John%20Lennon/Plastic%20Ono%20Band">John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</a>" (1970), Ono's "<a href="Yoko%20Ono/Plastic%20Ono%20Band">Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band</a>" (1970), and on Harrison's albums "<a href="All%20Things%20Must%20Pass">All Things Must Pass</a>" (1970), "<a href="Living%20in%20the%20Material%20World">Living in the Material World</a>" (1973) and "<a href="Dark%20Horse%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29">Dark Horse</a>" (1974). As well as <a href="Radha%20Krishna%20Temple">The Radha Krishna Temple's (London)</a> second single <a href="The%20Radha%20Krsna%20Temple%20%28album%29%23%26quot%3BGovinda%26quot%3B%20single">Govinda</a> (1971). In 1971, Starr participated in <a href="the%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh">the Concert for Bangladesh</a>, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single "<a href="It%20Don%27t%20Come%20Easy">It Don't Come Easy</a>", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, "<a href="Back%20Off%20Boogaloo">Back Off Boogaloo</a>" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a>, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 <a href="T.%20Rex%20%28band%29">T. Rex</a> documentary "<a href="Born%20to%20Boogie">Born to Boogie</a>".

In 1973, Starr earned two number one hits in the US: "<a href="Photograph%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20song%29">Photograph</a>", a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and "<a href="You%27re%20Sixteen">You're Sixteen</a>", written by the <a href="Sherman%20Brothers">Sherman Brothers</a>. Starr's third million-selling single, "You're Sixteen", was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both songs appeared on Starr's debut rock album, "<a href="Ringo%20%28album%29">Ringo</a>", produced by <a href="Richard%20Perry">Richard Perry</a> and featuring contributions from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included "<a href="Oh%20My%20My%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20song%29">Oh My My</a>", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US. Author <a href="Peter%20Doggett">Peter Doggett</a> describes "Ringo" as a template for Starr's solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, "he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing".

"<a href="Goodnight%20Vienna">Goodnight Vienna</a>" followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring contributions from Lennon, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> and <a href="Harry%20Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a>, the album included a cover of <a href="the%20Platters">the Platters</a>' "<a href="Only%20You%20%28And%20You%20Alone%29">Only You (And You Alone)</a>", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and <a href="Hoyt%20Axton">Hoyt Axton</a>'s "<a href="No%20No%20Song">No No Song</a>", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The Elton John-written "<a href="Snookeroo">Snookeroo</a>" failed to chart in the UK, however. During this period Starr became romantically involved with <a href="Lynsey%20de%20Paul">Lynsey de Paul</a>. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for <a href="Vera%20Lynn">Vera Lynn</a>, "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, "If I Don't Get You the Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.

Starr founded the record label <a href="Ring%20O%27%20Records">Ring O' Records</a> in 1975. The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by <a href="David%20Hentschel">David Hentschel</a>, <a href="Graham%20Bonnet">Graham Bonnet</a> and <a href="Rab%20Noakes">Rab Noakes</a>. The commercial impact of Starr's own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his "[not] taking enough interest" in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and <a href="Keith%20Moon">Keith Moon</a>: "We weren't musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music." Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, <a href="the%20Hollywood%20Vampires">the Hollywood Vampires</a>.

In November 1976 Starr appeared as a guest at <a href="the%20Band">the Band</a>'s farewell concert, featured in the 1978 <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> documentary "<a href="The%20Last%20Waltz">The Last Waltz</a>". Also in 1976, Starr issued "<a href="Ringo%27s%20Rotogravure">Ringo's Rotogravure</a>", the first release under his new contract with <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a> for the North American market and <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor</a> for all other territories. The album was produced by <a href="Arif%20Mardin">Arif Mardin</a> and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet "Rotogravure" and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, "<a href="A%20Dose%20of%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll">A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll</a>" (number 26) and a cover of "<a href="Hey%21%20Baby">Hey! Baby</a>" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr's formula; the result was a blend of <a href="disco">disco</a> and 1970s pop, "<a href="Ringo%20the%204th">Ringo the 4th</a>" (1977). The album failed to chart in the UK and peaked at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released "<a href="Bad%20Boy%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20album%29">Bad Boy</a>", which reached number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.

In April 1979 Starr became seriously ill with intestinal problems relating to his childhood bout of peritonitis, and was taken to the Princess Grace Hospital in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. He almost died and during an operation on 28 April 1979 several feet of intestine had to be removed. Three weeks later he played with McCartney and Harrison at Eric Clapton's wedding. On 28 November a fire destroyed his <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> home and much of his Beatles memorabilia.

On 19 May 1980 Starr and Barbara Bach survived a car crash in Surrey England.
Following <a href="Murder%20of%20John%20Lennon">Lennon's murder</a> in December 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, "<a href="All%20Those%20Years%20Ago">All Those Years Ago</a>", as a tribute to their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by Paul and <a href="Linda%20McCartney">Linda McCartney</a>, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released "<a href="Stop%20and%20Smell%20the%20Roses">Stop and Smell the Roses</a>", featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, <a href="Ronnie%20Wood">Ronnie Wood</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Stills">Stephen Stills</a>. The album's lead single, the Harrison-composed "Wrack My Brain", reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – "<a href="Nobody%20Told%20Me">Nobody Told Me</a>" and "<a href="Life%20Begins%20at%2040%20%28song%29">Life Begins at 40</a>" – but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend <a href="Barbara%20Bach">Barbara Bach</a> flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.

Following "Stop and Smell the Roses", Starr's recording projects were beset with problems. After completing "<a href="Old%20Wave">Old Wave</a>" in 1982 with producer <a href="Joe%20Walsh">Joe Walsh</a>, he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by <a href="Chips%20Moman">Chips Moman</a>, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series "<a href="Thomas%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Thomas & Friends</a>", a <a href="Britt%20Allcroft">Britt Allcroft</a> production based on the books by the <a href="W.%20V.%20Awdry">Reverend W. Awdry</a>. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, "<a href="Shining%20Time%20Station">Shining Time Station</a>".

In 1985, Starr performed with his son <a href="Zak%20Starkey">Zak</a> as part of <a href="Artists%20United%20Against%20Apartheid">Artists United Against Apartheid</a> on the recording "<a href="Sun%20City%20%28song%29">Sun City</a>", and, with Harrison and <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, was among the special guests on <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a>' TV special "". In 1987, he played drums on Harrison's Beatles pastiche "<a href="When%20We%20Was%20Fab">When We Was Fab</a>" and also appeared in <a href="Godley%20%26amp%3B%20Creme">Godley & Creme</a>'s innovative video clip for the song. The same year, Starr joined Harrison, Clapton, <a href="Jeff%20Lynne">Jeff Lynne</a> and Elton John in a performance at London's <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a> for the <a href="Prince%27s%20Trust">Prince's Trust</a> charity. In January 1988, he attended the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> ceremony in New York, with Harrison and Ono (the latter representing Lennon), to accept the Beatles' induction into the Hall of Fame.

During October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a <a href="Alcohol%20detoxification">detox</a> clinic in <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, each receiving a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: "Years I've lost, absolute years ... I've no idea what happened. I lived in a blackout." Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, <a href="Ringo%20Starr%20%26amp%3B%20His%20All-Starr%20Band">Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band</a> gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.

The first All-Starr excursion led to the release of "<a href="Ringo%20Starr%20and%20His%20All-Starr%20Band">Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band</a>" (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song "<a href="I%20Call%20Your%20Name">I Call Your Name</a>" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, <a href="Tom%20Petty">Tom Petty</a>, Joe Walsh and <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a>.

The following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" episode "<a href="Brush%20with%20Greatness">Brush with Greatness</a>" and contributed an original song, "You Never Know", to the soundtrack of the <a href="John%20Hughes%20%28filmmaker%29">John Hughes</a> film "<a href="Curly%20Sue">Curly Sue</a>". In 1992, he released his first studio album in nine years, "<a href="Time%20Takes%20Time">Time Takes Time</a>", which was produced by <a href="Phil%20Ramone">Phil Ramone</a>, <a href="Don%20Was">Don Was</a>, Lynne and <a href="Peter%20Asher">Peter Asher</a> and featured guest appearances by various stars including <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single "<a href="Weight%20of%20the%20World%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20song%29">Weight of the World</a>" peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking his first appearance on the singles chart there since "Only You" in 1974.

In 1994, he began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the "<a href="The%20Beatles%20Anthology">Beatles Anthology</a>" project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, "<a href="Free%20as%20a%20Bird">Free as a Bird</a>" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, "<a href="Real%20Love%20%28The%20Beatles%20song%29">Real Love</a>". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney's 1997 album "<a href="Flaming%20Pie">Flaming Pie</a>". Among the tracks to which he contributed, "Little Willow" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while "<a href="Really%20Love%20You">Really Love You</a>" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.

In 1998, he released two albums on the <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury</a> label. The studio album "<a href="Vertical%20Man">Vertical Man</a>" marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with <a href="Mark%20Hudson%20%28musician%29">Mark Hudson</a>, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on "<a href="VH1%20Storytellers">VH1 Storytellers</a>", which was released as an <a href="VH1%20Storytellers%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20album%29">album under the same name</a>. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed "<a href="I%20Wanna%20Be%20Santa%20Claus">I Wanna Be Santa Claus</a>". The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.

Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including <a href="Buddy%20Rich">Buddy Rich</a>, <a href="Ludwig-Musser">William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr.</a> On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed "Photograph" and a cover of Carl Perkins' "<a href="Honey%20Don%27t">Honey Don't</a>" at the "<a href="Concert%20for%20George">Concert for George</a>" held in the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, London. Early the following year, he released the album "<a href="Ringo%20Rama">Ringo Rama</a>", which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, "<a href="Never%20Without%20You">Never Without You</a>". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was <a href="Liam%20Lynch%20%28musician%29">Liam Lynch</a>, who produced a 2003 LP entitled "<a href="Fake%20Songs">Fake Songs</a>".

Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual <a href="NORAD%20Tracks%20Santa">NORAD tracks Santa program</a>. According to NORAD officials, he was "a Starr in the east" who helped guide <a href="North%20American%20Aerospace%20Defense%20Command">North American Aerospace Defense Command</a>'s Santa-tracking tradition.

His 2005 release "<a href="Choose%20Love">Choose Love</a>" eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9Madryn Street, stating that it had "no historical significance". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.

Starr released the album "<a href="Liverpool%208">Liverpool 8</a>" in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the <a href="European%20Capital%20of%20Culture">European Capital of Culture</a>. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by <a href="David%20A.%20Stewart">David A. Stewart</a>.<ref name="Erlewine/Liverpool8"></ref> Starr performed <a href="Liverpool%208%20%28song%29">the title track</a> at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.

In April 2009, he reunited with McCartney at the <a href="David%20Lynch%20Foundation">David Lynch Foundation</a>'s "<a href="David%20Lynch%20Foundation%232009%E2%80%932011">Change Begins Within</a>" benefit concert, held at New York's <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed "With a Little Help from My Friends", among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">E3</a> press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and <a href="Olivia%20Harrison">Olivia Harrison</a> to promote "" video game. In November 2009, he once again performed the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine for "<a href="The%20Official%20BBC%20Children%20in%20Need%20Medley">The Official BBC Children in Need Medley</a>".

In 2010 Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, "<a href="Y%20Not">Y Not</a>", which included the track "<a href="Walk%20with%20You">Walk with You</a>" and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney. Later that year, he appeared during "" as a celebrity phone operator. On 7 July 2010, he celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Ono, his son Zak, and McCartney.

Starr recorded a cover of <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>'s "Think It Over" for the 2011 tribute album "". In January 2012, he released the album "<a href="Ringo%202012">Ringo 2012</a>". Later that year, he announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the <a href="Pacific%20Rim">Pacific Rim</a> during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it was his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.

In January 2014, Starr joined McCartney for a special performance at the <a href="56th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">56th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in Los Angeles, where they performed the song "<a href="Queenie%20Eye">Queenie Eye</a>". That summer he toured Canada and the US with an updated version of the Twelfth All-Starr Band, featuring multi-instrumentalist <a href="Warren%20Ham">Warren Ham</a> instead of saxophonist <a href="Mark%20Rivera">Mark Rivera</a>. In July, Starr became involved in "#peacerocks", an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer <a href="John%20Varvatos">John Varvatos</a>, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.<ref name="instyle7/14"></ref> In September 2014, he won at the "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.

In January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new 11-track studio album, "<a href="Postcards%20from%20Paradise">Postcards from Paradise</a>". The album came just weeks in advance of Starr's induction into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Ringo and his band announced a forthcoming <a href="Ringo%27s%20Summer%202016%20Tour">Summer 2016 Tour</a> of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.

On 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), he released a new single entitled "Give More Love," followed by, on 15 September 2017 (by <a href="Universal%20Music%20Enterprises">UM</a>), his nineteenth studio album also entitled "<a href="Give%20More%20Love">Give More Love</a>". The album features appearances by Paul McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, David A. Stewart, <a href="Gary%20Nicholson%20%28singer%29">Gary Nicholson</a>, and members of the All-Starr Band.

During his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and <a href="blues">blues</a> music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by <a href="country%20music">country</a> artists, including <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a>, Buck Owens and <a href="Hank%20Snow">Hank Snow</a>, and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> artists such as <a href="Chico%20Hamilton">Chico Hamilton</a> and <a href="Yusef%20Lateef">Yusef Lateef</a>, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">grooves</a>. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on." He stated that he "was never really into drummers", but identified <a href="Cozy%20Cole">Cozy Cole</a> 1958 <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> of <a href="Benny%20Goodman">Benny Goodman</a> "<a href="Topsy%20%28instrumental%29">Topsy Part Two</a>" as "the one drum record" he bought.

Starr's first musical hero was <a href="Gene%20Autry">Gene Autry</a>, about whom he commented: "I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, '<a href="South%20of%20the%20Border%20%281939%20song%29">South of the Border</a>'". By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of <a href="Lee%20Dorsey">Lee Dorsey</a>. In November 1964, Starr told "Melody Maker": "Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured."

Starr's drumming has received praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: "I'm no good on the technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that." Beatles producer George Martin stated: "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." Starr commented: "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it."

In 2011, readers of "Rolling Stone" magazine voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans, writing for the Percussive Arts Society, stated: "I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums". Drummer <a href="Steve%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Steve Smith</a> commented on Starr's musical contribution:

Starr said his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on "Ringo" and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For "Ringo's Rotogravure" in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as "Thunder" and Keltner as "Lightnin'".

Starr influenced <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a> drummer <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a>, who said: "I think he's vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on '<a href="A%20Day%20in%20the%20Life">A Day in the Life</a>' are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, 'I want it like that', and they really wouldn't know what to do." Collins also acknowledged that the drumming style featured on the 1983 Genesis song "<a href="That%27s%20All%20%28Genesis%20song%29">That's All</a>" was an affectionate attempt at a "Ringo Starr drum part".

In an often-repeated but apocryphal story, Lennon, asked if Starr was the best drummer in the world, quipped that he "wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles". The line actually comes from a 1981 episode of the BBC Radio comedy series <a href="Radio%20Active%20%28radio%20series%29">"Radio Active"</a>, though it gained more prominence when used by the television comedian <a href="Jasper%20Carrott">Jasper Carrott</a> in 1983, three years after Lennon's death. In September 1980, Lennon told "Rolling Stone":

In his book "The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions", Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles. Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the <a href="matched%20grip">matched grip</a>, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of "Classic Rock Drummers": "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers."

Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for "Yellow Submarine" from "Revolver" and "With a Little Help from My Friends" on "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited <a href="baritone">baritone</a> vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and "Carry That Weight". He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden". In addition, he sang lead on "I Wanna Be Your Man", "Boys", "Matchbox", "Honey Don't", "Act Naturally", "Good Night" and "<a href="What%20Goes%20On%20%28Beatles%20song%29">What Goes On</a>".

Starr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase or "Ringoisms", such as "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28song%29%23Title">a hard day's night</a>" and "<a href="Tomorrow%20Never%20Knows%23Title">tomorrow never knows</a>", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: "Ringo would do these little <a href="malapropism">malapropism</a>s, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic." Starr also occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line "<a href="darning">darning</a> his socks in the night when there's nobody there" in "<a href="Eleanor%20Rigby">Eleanor Rigby</a>".

Starr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: "<a href="Octopus%27s%20Garden">Octopus's Garden</a>" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Pass%20Me%20By">Don't Pass Me By</a>". He is credited as a co-writer of "<a href="What%20Goes%20On%20%28Beatles%20song%29">What Goes On</a>", "<a href="Flying%20%28Beatles%20instrumental%29">Flying</a>" and "<a href="Dig%20It%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Dig It</a>". On material issued after the break-up, Starr received a writing credit for "Taking a Trip to Carolina" and received joint songwriting credits with the other Beatles for "<a href="12-Bar%20Original">12-Bar Original</a>", "Los Paranoias", "<a href="Christmas%20Time%20%28Is%20Here%20Again%29">Christmas Time (Is Here Again)</a>", "<a href="Suzy%20Parker%20%28Beatles%20Song%29">Suzy Parker</a>" from the "Let It Be" film, and "Jessie's Dream" from the "Magical Mystery Tour" film.

When Starr married <a href="Maureen%20Starkey%20Tigrett">Maureen Cox</a> in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein was <a href="best%20man">best man</a>, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US <a href="novelty%20song">novelty song</a>, "Treat Him Tender, Maureen", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: <a href="Zak%20Starkey">Zak</a> (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, <a href="Tittenhurst%20Park">Tittenhurst Park</a> at <a href="Sunninghill%2C%20Berkshire">Sunninghill</a> in Berkshire, and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Starr later admitted to being "a drunk, a wife-beater and an absent father". Maureen died from <a href="leukaemia">leukaemia</a> at age 48 in 1994.

In 1980, on the set of the film "<a href="Caveman%20%28film%29">Caveman</a>", Starr met actress <a href="Barbara%20Bach">Barbara Bach</a>; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>'s <a href="Keith%20Moon">Keith Moon</a>. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. Starr has eight grandchildren – one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.

Starr and Bach split their time between homes in <a href="Cranleigh">Cranleigh, Surrey</a>; Los Angeles; and <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. Starr was listed at number 56 in the "<a href="Sunday%20Times%20Rich%20List%202011">Sunday Times Rich List 2011</a>", with an estimated personal wealth of £150 million. In 2012, he was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014, Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its <a href="Grade%20II">Grade II</a>-listed <a href="Jacobean%20architecture">Jacobean</a> house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> off <a href="King%27s%20Road">King's Road</a>, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.

In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via <a href="Julien%27s%20Auctions">Julien's Auctions</a> in Los Angeles.<ref name="Julien/Property"></ref> The collection included Starr's first <a href="Ludwig-Musser">Ludwig</a> Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered "0000001". The auction raised over $9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.

In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the <a href="Brexit">United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union</a>, stating: "I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately." In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to "get on with" Brexit, declaring that "to be in control of your country is a good move".

Starr is a <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a> and <a href="meditation">meditates</a> daily.

Radiocarbon dating

Radiocarbon dating (also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating) is a method for <a href="Chronological%20dating">determining the age</a> of an object containing <a href="organic%20material">organic material</a> by using the properties of <a href="carbon-14">radiocarbon</a>, a radioactive <a href="Isotopes%20of%20carbon">isotope of carbon</a>.

The method was developed in the late 1940s by <a href="Willard%20Libby">Willard Libby</a>, who received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for his work in 1960. It is based on the fact that radiocarbon () is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s with atmospheric <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. The resulting combines with atmospheric <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> to form radioactive <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, which is incorporated into plants by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>; animals then acquire by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of it contains begins to decrease as the undergoes <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>. Measuring the amount of in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less there is to be detected, and because the <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.

Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of throughout the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> (reservoir effects). Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to <a href="fossil%20fuels">fossil fuels</a> is substantially longer than the time it takes for its to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in about 1965 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.

Measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices, which counted the amount of <a href="beta%20radiation">beta radiation</a> emitted by decaying atoms in a sample. More recently, <a href="accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">accelerator mass spectrometry</a> has become the method of choice; it counts all the atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples (as small as individual plant seeds), and gives results much more quickly. The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>. In addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods, it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances. Histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the "radiocarbon revolution". Radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated, such as the end of the <a href="Younger%20Dryas">last ice age</a>, and the beginning of the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> and <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> in different regions.

In 1939, <a href="Martin%20Kamen">Martin Kamen</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Ruben">Samuel Ruben</a> of the <a href="Lawrence%20Radiation%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley</a> began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's <a href="half-life">half-life</a> was far longer than had been previously thought. This was followed by a prediction by <a href="Serge%20A.%20Korff">Serge A. Korff</a>, then employed at the <a href="Franklin%20Institute">Franklin Institute</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, that the interaction of <a href="w%3Aneutron%20temperature">thermal neutrons</a> with in the upper atmosphere would create . It had previously been thought that would be more likely to be created by <a href="deuteron">deuteron</a>s interacting with . At some time during World War II, <a href="Willard%20Libby">Willard Libby</a>, who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.

In 1945, Libby moved to the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include as well as non-radioactive carbon. Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with <a href="methane">methane</a> collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after <a href="Isotope%20enrichment">isotopically enriching</a> their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained . By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.

Libby and <a href="James%20R.%20Arnold">James Arnold</a> proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, <a href="Zoser">Zoser</a> and <a href="Sneferu">Sneferu</a>, independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years. These results were published in "Science" in 1949. Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide. In 1960, Libby was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for this work.

In nature, <a href="carbon">carbon</a> exists as two stable, nonradioactive <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s: <a href="carbon-12">carbon-12</a> (), and <a href="carbon-13">carbon-13</a> (), and a radioactive isotope, <a href="carbon-14">carbon-14</a> (), also known as "radiocarbon". The half-life of (the time it takes for half of a given amount of to <a href="Radioactive%20decay">decay</a>) is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years, but is constantly being produced in the lower <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a> and upper <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a>, primarily by galactic <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s, and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays. These generate neutrons that in turn create when they strike <a href="nitrogen-14">nitrogen-14</a> () atoms. The following <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a> is the main pathway by which is created:
where n represents a <a href="neutron">neutron</a> and p represents a <a href="proton">proton</a>.

Once produced, the quickly combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide (), and ultimately carbon dioxide ().

Carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Animals eat the plants, and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>. The ratio of to is approximately 1.25 parts of to 10 parts of . In addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope .

The equation for the radioactive decay of is:
By emitting a beta particle (an <a href="electron">electron</a>, e) and an <a href="Antineutrino">electron antineutrino</a> (), one of the neutrons in the nucleus changes to a proton and the nucleus reverts to the stable (non-radioactive) isotope .

During its life, a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with the atmosphere, or through its diet. It will therefore have the same proportion of as the atmosphere, or in the case of marine animals or plants, with the ocean. Once it dies, it ceases to acquire , but the within its biological material at that time will continue to decay, and so the ratio of to in its remains will gradually decrease. Because decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon – the older the sample, the less will be left.

The equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:
where "N" is the number of atoms of the isotope in the original sample (at time "t" = 0, when the organism from which the sample was taken died), and "N" is the number of atoms left after time "t". "λ" is a constant that depends on the particular isotope; for a given isotope it is equal to the reciprocal of the <a href="Radioactive%20decay%23Time%20constant%20and%20mean-life">mean-life</a> – i.e. the average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay. The mean-life, denoted by "τ", of is 8,267 years, so the equation above can be rewritten as:
The sample is assumed to have originally had the same / ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere, and since the size of the sample is known, the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated, yielding "N", the number of atoms in the original sample. Measurement of "N", the number of atoms currently in the sample, allows the calculation of "t", the age of the sample, using the equation above.

The half-life of a radioactive isotope (usually denoted by t) is a more familiar concept than the mean-life, so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life, it is more usual to quote the value of 's half-life than its mean-life. The currently accepted value for the half-life of is 5,730 ± 40 years. This means that after 5,730 years, only half of the initial will remain; a quarter will remain after 11,460 years; an eighth after 17,190 years; and so on.

The above calculations make several assumptions, such as that the level of in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. This is done by calibration curves (discussed below), which convert a measurement of in a sample into an estimated calendar age. The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the "radiocarbon age", which is the age in "radiocarbon years" of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the atmospheric / ratio has not changed over time.

Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for . In Libby's 1949 paper he used a value of 5720 ± 47 years, based on research by Engelkemeir et al. This was remarkably close to the modern value, but shortly afterwards the accepted value was revised to 5568 ± 30 years, and this value was in use for more than a decade. It was revised again in the early 1960s to 5,730 ± 40 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). For consistency with these early papers, it was agreed at the 1962 Radiocarbon Conference in Cambridge (UK) to use the “Libby half-life” of 5568 years. Radiocarbon ages are still calculated using this half-life, and are known as "Conventional Radiocarbon Age". Since the calibration curve (IntCal) also reports past atmospheric concentration using this conventional age, any conventional ages calibrated against the IntCal curve will produce a correct calibrated age. When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of in the atmosphere over time.

Carbon is distributed throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir, and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir. The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them. This affects the ratio of to in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir. The atmosphere, which is where is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the it contains mixes in less than seven years. The ratio of to in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of to , it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that either some of the has decayed, or the reservoir is receiving carbon that is not at the atmospheric baseline. The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere. The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years, but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir. Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted , and water recently at the surface, with in equilibrium with the atmosphere.

Creatures living at the ocean surface have the same ratios as the water they live in, and as a result of the reduced / ratio, the radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 400 years. Organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same / ratio as the atmosphere. These organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown on the diagram. Accumulated dead organic matter, of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a / ratio lower than that of the biosphere.

The variation in the / ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered. The errors are of four general types:

In the early years of using the technique, it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric / ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the / ratio had changed over time. The question was resolved by the <a href="Dendrochronology">study of tree rings</a>: comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years. (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.) In the 1960s, <a href="Hans%20Suess">Hans Suess</a> was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists. This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their replenished and instead start losing through decay. Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in. Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of "N" (the number of atoms of remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of "N" – the number of atoms of in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time. Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the / ratio. These curves are described in more detail <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating%23Calibration">below</a>.

Coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during the 19th century. Both are sufficiently old that they contain little or no detectable and, as a result, the released substantially diluted the atmospheric / ratio. Dating an object from the early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than the true date. For the same reason, concentrations in the neighbourhood of large cities are lower than the atmospheric average. This fossil fuel effect (also known as the Suess effect, after Hans Suess, who first reported it in 1955) would only amount to a reduction of 0.2% in activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir, but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean, the actual effect is a 3% reduction.

A much larger effect comes from above-ground nuclear testing, which released large numbers of neutrons and created . From about 1950 until 1963, when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned, it is estimated that several tonnes of were created. If all this extra had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir, it would have led to an increase in the / ratio of only a few per cent, but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of in the atmosphere, with the peak level occurring in 1964 for the northern hemisphere, and in 1966 for the southern hemisphere. The level has since dropped, as this <a href="bomb%20pulse">bomb pulse</a> or "bomb carbon" (as it is sometimes called) percolates into the rest of the reservoir.

Photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things. In photosynthetic pathways is absorbed slightly more easily than , which in turn is more easily absorbed than . The differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to / and / ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere. This effect is known as isotopic fractionation.

To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant, the amounts of both and isotopes are measured, and the resulting / ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB. The / ratio is used instead of / because the former is much easier to measure, and the latter can be easily derived: the depletion of relative to is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes, so the depletion for is twice the depletion of . The fractionation of , known as , is calculated as follows:

where the ‰ sign indicates <a href="parts%20per%20thousand">parts per thousand</a>. Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of , most measured values are negative.

For marine organisms, the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood, and the values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, has poor solubility in water, which means there is less available for the photosynthetic reactions. Under these conditions, fractionation is reduced, and at temperatures above 14 °C the values are correspondingly higher, while at lower temperatures, becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms. The value for animals depends on their diet. An animal that eats food with high values will have a higher than one that eats food with lower values. The animal's own biochemical processes can also impact the results: for example, both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of than is found in the animal's diet, though for different biochemical reasons. The enrichment of bone also implies that excreted material is depleted in relative to the diet.

Since makes up about 1% of the carbon in a sample, the / ratio can be accurately measured by <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>. Typical values of have been found by experiment for many plants, as well as for different parts of animals such as bone <a href="collagen">collagen</a>, but when dating a given sample it is better to determine the value for that sample directly than to rely on the published values.

The carbon exchange between atmospheric and carbonate at the ocean surface is also subject to fractionation, with in the atmosphere more likely than to dissolve in the ocean. The result is an overall increase in the / ratio in the ocean of 1.5%, relative to the / ratio in the atmosphere. This increase in concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water (containing old, and hence depleted, carbon) from the deep ocean, so that direct measurements of radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere. Correcting for isotopic fractionation, as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of the biosphere, gives an apparent age of about 400 years for ocean surface water.

Libby's original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that the / ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the world, but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.

<a href="Marine%20reservoir%20effect">Marine effect</a>

The in the atmosphere transfers to the ocean by dissolving in the surface water as carbonate and bicarbonate ions; at the same time the carbonate ions in the water are returning to the air as . This exchange process brings from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean, but the thus introduced takes a long time to percolate through the entire volume of the ocean. The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this "old" water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation). This effect is not uniform – the average effect is about 400 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other. These deviations can be accounted for in calibration, and users of software such as CALIB can provide as an input the appropriate correction for the location of their samples. The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.

Hemisphere effect

The northern and southern hemispheres have <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">atmospheric circulation</a> systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between the two. The atmospheric / ratio is lower in the southern hemisphere, with an apparent additional age of about 40 years for radiocarbon results from the south as compared to the north. This is because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north. Since the surface ocean is depleted in because of the marine effect, is removed from the southern atmosphere more quickly than in the north. The effect is strengthened by strong upwelling around Antarctica.

Other effects

If the carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then the result will be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, which is mostly composed of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it. This is known as the <a href="hard%20water">hard water</a> effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as <a href="humus">humus</a> can produce similar results, and can also reduce the apparent age if they are of more recent origin than the sample. The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.

<a href="Volcanic%20eruptions">Volcanic eruptions</a> eject large amounts of carbon into the air. The carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio in the vicinity of the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants in the neighbourhood of the <a href="Furnas">Furnas</a> caldera in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> were found to have apparent ages that ranged from 250 years to 3320 years.

Any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining , causes an error in the other direction independent of age – a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it really is, regardless of the date of the sample.

Samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring the content; this can mean conversion to gaseous, liquid, or solid form, depending on the measurement technique to be used. Before this can be done, the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents. This includes removing visible contaminants, such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial. Alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination, but care has to be taken to avoid removing the part of the sample that contains the carbon to be tested.


Particularly for older samples, it may be useful to enrich the amount of in the sample before testing. This can be done with a thermal diffusion column. The process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise, but it allows more precise measurement of the / ratio in old material and extends the maximum age that can be reliably reported.

Once contamination has been removed, samples must be converted to a form suitable for the measuring technology to be used. Where gas is required, is widely used. For samples to be used in <a href="Liquid%20scintillation%20counting">liquid scintillation counters</a>, the carbon must be in liquid form; the sample is typically converted to <a href="benzene">benzene</a>. For <a href="accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">accelerator mass spectrometry</a>, solid graphite targets are the most common, although gaseous can also be used.

The quantity of material needed for testing depends on the sample type and the technology being used. There are two types of testing technology: detectors that record radioactivity, known as beta counters, and accelerator mass spectrometers. For beta counters, a sample weighing at least is typically required. Accelerator mass spectrometry is much more sensitive, and samples containing as little as 0.5 milligrams of carbon can be used.

For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments, the only way to measure the in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms. In this approach, what is measured is the activity, in number of decay events per unit mass per time period, of the sample. This method is also known as "beta counting", because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying atoms that are detected. In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available: directly counting the number of and atoms in a given sample, via accelerator mass spectrometry, usually referred to as AMS. AMS counts the / ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and / ratio can be converted into each other exactly. For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but AMS is now more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements. In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting; and it is much faster – an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.

Libby's first detector was a <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a> of his own design. He converted the carbon in his sample to lamp black (soot) and coated the inner surface of a cylinder with it. This cylinder was inserted into the counter in such a way that the counting wire was inside the sample cylinder, in order that there should be no material between the sample and the wire. Any interposing material would have interfered with the detection of radioactivity, since the beta particles emitted by decaying are so weak that half are stopped by a 0.01 mm thickness of aluminium.

Libby's method was soon superseded by gas <a href="proportional%20counter">proportional counter</a>s, which were less affected by bomb carbon (the additional created by nuclear weapons testing). These counters record bursts of ionization caused by the beta particles emitted by the decaying atoms; the bursts are proportional to the energy of the particle, so other sources of ionization, such as background radiation, can be identified and ignored. The counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding, to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays. In addition, <a href="Electronic%20anticoincidence">anticoincidence</a> detectors are used; these record events outside the counter, and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside the counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.

The other common technology used for measuring activity is liquid scintillation counting, which was invented in 1950, but which had to wait until the early 1960s, when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed, to become competitive with gas counting; after 1970 liquid counters became the more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories. The counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by the beta particles emitted by as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to the benzene. Like gas counters, liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters.

For both the gas proportional counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured is the number of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or <a href="becquerel">becquerel</a>s per kg (Bq/kg C, in <a href="SI%20units">SI units</a>). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample – a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's . In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.

AMS counts the atoms of and in a given sample, determining the / ratio directly. The sample, often in the form of graphite, is made to emit C ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an <a href="Particle%20accelerator">accelerator</a>. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The ions, which may have from 1 to 4 positive charges (C to C), depending on the accelerator design, are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the stream, but since the volume of (and , needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a <a href="Faraday%20cup">Faraday cup</a>. The large positive charge induced by the stripper forces molecules such as , which has a weight close enough to to interfere with the measurements, to dissociate, so they are not detected. Most AMS machines also measure the sample's , for use in calculating the sample's radiocarbon age. The use of AMS, as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry, is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass, such as and . As with beta counting, both blank samples and standard samples are used. Two different kinds of blank may be measured: a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing, to detect any machine background, and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly the same way as the sample which is being dated. Any signal from the machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed the expected path inside the detector, or by carbon hydrides such as or . A signal from the process blank measures the amount of contamination introduced during the preparation of the sample. These measurements are used in the subsequent calculation of the age of the sample.

The calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, since beta counters measure the sample's radioactivity whereas AMS determines the ratio of the three different carbon isotopes in the sample.

To determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000 lb of which was prepared by the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) in 1977 from French beet harvests.

The results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of , , and , which are used to calculate Fm, the "fraction modern". This is defined as the ratio between the / ratio in the sample and the / ratio in modern carbon, which is in turn defined as the / ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.

Both beta counting and AMS results have to be corrected for fractionation. This is necessary because different materials of the same age, which because of fractionation have naturally different / ratios, will appear to be of different ages because the / ratio is taken as the indicator of age. To avoid this, all radiocarbon measurements are converted to the measurement that would have been seen had the sample been made of wood, which has a known δ value of −25‰.

Once the corrected / ratio is known, a "radiocarbon age" is calculated using:

The calculation uses 8,033, the mean-life derived from Libby's half-life of 5,568 years, not 8,267, the mean-life derived from the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years. Libby’s value for the half-life is used to maintain consistency with early radiocarbon testing results; calibration curves include a correction for this, so the accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured.

The reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.

Radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50,000 years old, as samples older than that have insufficient to be measurable. Older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times. These techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present.

Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one <a href="standard%20deviation">standard deviation</a> (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a> of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.

Errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.

The calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years: i.e. dates that represent the age the sample would be if the / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.

To produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by <a href="Wesley%20Ferguson">Wesley Ferguson</a>. Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by "cosmic "schwung"", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after <a href="Hessel%20de%20Vries">Hessel de Vries</a>.

A calibration curve is used by taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse of the way the curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.Over the next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches. These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, <a href="varve">varve</a>s, <a href="coral">coral</a>, plant <a href="macrofossil">macrofossil</a>s, <a href="speleothems">speleothems</a>, and <a href="foraminifera">foraminifera</a>. The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect. The southern curve (SHCAL13) is based on independent data where possible, and derived from the northern curve by adding the average offset for the southern hemisphere where no direct data was available. There is also a separate marine calibration curve, MARINE13. For a set of samples forming a sequence with a known separation in time, these samples form a subset of the calibration curve. The sequence can be compared to the calibration curve and the best match to the sequence established. This “wiggle-matching” technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce. The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified <a href="tephra">tephra</a> sequence in New Zealand, believed to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314 AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching. The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.

<a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian statistical techniques</a> can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated. For example, if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a stratigraphic sequence, Bayesian analysis can be used to evaluate dates which are outliers, and can calculate improved probability distributions, based on the prior information that the sequence should be ordered in time. When Bayesian analysis was introduced, its use was limited by the need to use mainframe computers to perform the calculations, but the technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers, such as OxCal.

Several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since the first samples were dated. As of 2019, the standard format required by the journal "<a href="Radiocarbon%20%28magazine%29">Radiocarbon</a>" is as follows.

Uncalibrated dates should be reported as "<laboratory>: < year> ± <range> BP", where:

For example, the uncalibrated date "UtC-2020: 3510 ± 60 BP" indicates that the sample was tested by the Utrecht van der Graaff Laboratorium, where it has a sample number of 2020, and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present, ± 60 years. Related forms are sometimes used: for example, "10 ka BP" means 10,000 radiocarbon years before present (i.e. 8,050 BC), and yr BP might be used to distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as <a href="Thermoluminescence%20dating">thermoluminescence</a>.

Calibrated dates are frequently reported as cal BP, cal BC, or cal AD, again with BP referring to the year 1950 as the zero date. "Radiocarbon" gives two options for reporting calibrated dates. A common format is "cal <date-range> <confidence>", where:

For example, "cal 1220–1281 AD (1σ)" means a calibrated date for which the true date lies between 1220 AD and 1281 AD, with the confidence level given as 1σ, or one standard deviation. Calibrated dates can also be expressed as BP instead of using BC and AD. The curve used to calibrate the results should be the latest available INTCAL curve. Calibrated dates should also identify any programs, such as OxCal, used to perform the calibration. In addition, an article in "Radiocarbon" in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that information should be provided about sample treatment, including the sample material, pretreatment methods, and quality control measurements; that the citation to the software used for calibration should specify the version number and any options or models used; and that the calibrated date should be given with the associated probabilities for each range.

A key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is <a href="archaeological%20association">archaeological association</a>: what is the true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site? It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, but there are also many cases where this is not possible. Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time. In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two. There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.

Contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in the specimen selection and preparation. In 2014, <a href="Thomas%20Higham">Thomas Higham</a> and co-workers suggested that many of the dates published for <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> artefacts are too recent because of contamination by "young carbon".

As a tree grows, only the outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample depends on where the sample is taken from. This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. In addition, if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found. This is often referred to as the "<a href="old%20wood">old wood</a>" problem. One example is the Bronze Age <a href="trackway">trackway</a> at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. It is not always possible to recognize re-use. Other materials can present the same problem: for example, <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a> is known to have been used by some <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition. For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.

Archaeology is not the only field to make use of radiocarbon dating. The ability to date minute samples using AMS has meant that palaeobotanists and palaeoclimatologists can use radiocarbon dating on pollen samples. Radiocarbon dates can also be used in geology, sedimentology, and lake studies, for example. Dates on organic material recovered from strata of interest can be used to correlate strata in different locations that appear to be similar on geological grounds. Dating material from one location gives date information about the other location, and the dates are also used to place strata in the overall geological timeline.

The <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> is a geological epoch that began about 2.6 million years ago. The <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago, when the Pleistocene ends. Establishing the date of this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists for much of the 20th century. At <a href="Two%20Creeks%2C%20Wisconsin">Two Creeks</a>, in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered (<a href="Two%20Creeks%20Buried%20Forest%20State%20Natural%20Area">Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area</a>), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice before the end of the Pleistocene in that area. Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old, and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a> before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America. In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years. This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood. Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be most accurate averaging 11,600 BP. There was initial resistance to these results on the part of <a href="Ernst%20Antevs">Ernst Antevs</a>, the <a href="palaeobotanist">palaeobotanist</a> who had worked on the Scandinavian varve series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists. In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years. Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with results provided by over 70 laboratories. These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP. The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.

In 1947, <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">scrolls</a> were discovered in caves near the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a> that proved to contain writing in <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>, most of which are thought to have been produced by the <a href="Essenes">Essenes</a>, a small Jewish sect. These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible. A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the <a href="Great%20Isaiah%20scroll">Great Isaiah Scroll</a>, was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years. Based on an analysis of the writing style, <a href="Palaeography">palaeographic</a> estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s. The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD. In all but two cases the scrolls were determined to be within 100 years of the palaeographically determined age. The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355–295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210–45 BC. Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young. Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.

Soon after the publication of Libby's 1949 paper in "Science", universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories, and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active research laboratories. It quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid, despite certain discrepancies, the causes of which then remained unknown.

The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the "radiocarbon revolution". In the words of anthropologist R. E. Taylor, " data made a "world" prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.

The dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in the prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric Europe. Researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent, or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them. As radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances, it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally. This has been described as a "second radiocarbon revolution", and with regard to British prehistory, archaeologist <a href="Richard%20J.C.%20Atkinson">Richard Atkinson</a> has characterized the impact of radiocarbon dating as "radical ... therapy" for the "progressive disease of invasionism". More broadly, the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data. Taylor has also described the impact of AMS, and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples, as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution.

Occasionally, radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest, for example the <a href="Shroud%20of%20Turin">Shroud of Turin</a>, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating%20of%20the%20Shroud%20of%20Turin">dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988</a>; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.

Researchers have studied other radioactive isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest; such isotopes include <a href="Helium-3"></a>, <a href="Beryllium-10"></a>, <a href="Neon-21"></a>, <a href="Aluminium-26"></a>, and <a href="Chlorine-36"></a>. With the development of AMS in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques, which have been primarily applied to dating rocks. Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods, as with <a href="K-Ar%20dating">potassium–argon dating</a>, <a href="argon%E2%80%93argon%20dating">argon–argon dating</a>, and <a href="Uranium%E2%80%93thorium%20dating">uranium series dating</a>. Other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include <a href="Thermoluminescence%20dating">thermoluminescence</a>, <a href="optically%20stimulated%20luminescence">optically stimulated luminescence</a>, <a href="electron%20spin%20resonance">electron spin resonance</a>, and <a href="fission%20track%20dating">fission track dating</a>, as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers, such as <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>, <a href="tephrochronology">tephrochronology</a>, and <a href="varve">varve</a> chronology.

Redshift

In <a href="physics">physics</a>, redshift is a phenomenon where <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> (such as light) from an object undergoes an increase in <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>. Whether or not the radiation is visible, "redshift" means an increase in wavelength, equivalent to a decrease in wave <a href="frequency">frequency</a> and <a href="photon%20energy">photon energy</a>, in accordance with, respectively, the <a href="Wave%20theory%20of%20light">wave</a> and <a href="Light%23Quantum%20theory">quantum</a> theories of light.

Neither the emitted nor perceived light is necessarily red; instead, the term refers to the human perception of longer wavelengths as <a href="red">red</a>, which is at the section of the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a> with the longest wavelengths. Examples of redshifting are a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> perceived as an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, or initially visible light perceived as <a href="radio%20wave">radio wave</a>s. The opposite of a redshift is a <a href="blueshift">blueshift</a>, where wavelengths shorten and energy increases. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.

There are three main causes of red (and blue shifts) in astronomy and cosmology: 


Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been used to develop several terrestrial technologies such as <a href="Doppler%20radar">Doppler radar</a> and <a href="radar%20gun">radar gun</a>s. Redshifts are also seen in the <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> observations of <a href="Astronomy">astronomical</a> objects. Its value is represented by the letter "z."

A <a href="special%20relativity">special relativistic</a> <a href="%23Redshift%20formulae">redshift formula</a> (and its <a href="classical%20physics">classical approximation</a>) can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> is <a href="Minkowski%20space">flat</a>. However, in many contexts, such as <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s and <a href="Big%20Bang%20cosmology">Big Bang cosmology</a>, redshifts must be calculated using <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of <a href="Frame%20of%20reference">frame transformation laws</a>. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including <a href="scattering">scattering</a> and <a href="physical%20optics">optical effects</a>; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on <a href="%23Effects%20due%20to%20physical%20optics%20or%20radiative%20transfer">physical optics and radiative transfer</a>).

The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of <a href="wave">wave mechanics</a> and the exploration of phenomena associated with the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a>. The effect is named after <a href="Christian%20Doppler">Christian Doppler</a>, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for <a href="sound%20wave">sound wave</a>s by the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> scientist <a href="C.H.D.%20Buys%20Ballot">Christophorus Buys Ballot</a> in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all <a href="wave">wave</a>s, and in particular suggested that the varying <a href="color">color</a>s of <a href="star">star</a>s could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's <a href="color%20temperature">temperature</a>, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.

The first Doppler redshift was described by French physicist <a href="Hippolyte%20Fizeau">Hippolyte Fizeau</a> in 1848, who pointed to the shift in <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the "Doppler–Fizeau effect". In 1868, British astronomer <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method. In 1871, optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in <a href="Fraunhofer%20lines">Fraunhofer lines</a> using solar rotation, about 0.1 Å in the red.
In 1887, Vogel and Scheiner discovered the "annual Doppler effect", the yearly change in the Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic due to the orbital velocity of the Earth. In 1901, <a href="Aristarkh%20Apollonovich%20Belopolsky">Aristarkh Belopolsky</a> verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.

The earliest occurrence of the term "red-shift" in print (in this hyphenated form) appears to be by American astronomer <a href="Walter%20S.%20Adams">Walter S. Adams</a> in 1908, in which he mentions "Two methods of investigating that nature of the nebular red-shift". The word does not appear unhyphenated until about 1934 by <a href="Willem%20de%20Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a>, perhaps indicating that up to that point its German equivalent, "Rotverschiebung", was more commonly used.

Beginning with observations in 1912, <a href="Vesto%20Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> discovered that most <a href="Spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxies</a>, then mostly thought to be <a href="Spiral%20galaxy%23Spiral%20nebula">spiral nebulae</a>, had considerable redshifts. Slipher first reports on his measurement in the inaugural volume of the "<a href="Lowell%20Observatory%20Bulletin">Lowell Observatory Bulletin</a>". Three years later, he wrote a review in the journal "<a href="Popular%20Astronomy%20%28US%20magazine%29">Popular Astronomy</a>". In it he states that "the early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of –300 km(/s) showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well." Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, all but three having observable "positive" (that is recessional) velocities. Subsequently, <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> discovered an approximate relationship between the redshifts of such "nebulae" and the <a href="distance">distance</a>s to them with the formulation of his eponymous <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a>. These observations corroborated <a href="Alexander%20Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>'s 1922 work, in which he derived the <a href="Friedmann%20equations">Friedmann-Lemaître equations</a>. They are today considered strong evidence for an <a href="expanding%20universe">expanding universe</a> and the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> theory.

The <a href="visible%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of light that comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as <a href="spectral%20line">absorption lines</a>, <a href="spectral%20line">emission lines</a>, or other variations in <a href="Light%20intensity%20%28disambiguation%29">light intensity</a>. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common <a href="chemical%20element">atomic element</a> in space is <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a <a href="hydrogen%20spectrum">signature spectrum</a> specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or <a href="white%20noise">white noise</a> (random fluctuations in a spectrum).

Redshift (and blueshift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy, it is customary to refer to this change using a <a href="dimensionless%20quantity">dimensionless quantity</a> called . If represents wavelength and represents frequency (note, where is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>), then is defined by the equations:

After is measured, the distinction between redshift and blueshift is simply a matter of whether is positive or negative. See the <a href="%23Redshift%20formulae">formula section</a> below for some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blueshift is observed. For example, <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a> blueshifts () are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater <a href="energy">energies</a>. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.

In general relativity one can derive several important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries, as summarized in the following table. In all cases the magnitude of the shift (the value of ) is independent of the wavelength.
If a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift () occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then <a href="blueshift">blueshift</a> () occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a>. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the "Doppler redshift". If the source moves away from the observer with <a href="velocity">velocity</a> , which is much less than the speed of light (), the redshift is given by

where is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. In the classical Doppler effect, the frequency of the source is not modified, but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency.

A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the <a href="relativistic%20Doppler%20effect">relativistic Doppler effect</a>. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the <a href="time%20dilation">time dilation</a> of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> which can be corrected for by introducing the <a href="Lorentz%20factor">Lorentz factor</a> into the classical Doppler formula as follows (for motion solely in the line of sight):

This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell, called the <a href="Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell%20experiment">Ives–Stilwell experiment</a>.

Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the <a href="magnitude%20%28mathematics%29">magnitude</a> of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the <a href="scalar%20resolute">projection</a> of the movement of the source into the <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">line-of-sight</a> which yields different results for different orientations. If is the angle between the direction of relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer's frame (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:

and for motion solely in the line of sight (), this equation reduces to:

For the special case that the light is approaching at <a href="right%20angle">right angle</a>s () to the direction of relative motion in the observer's frame, the relativistic redshift is known as the <a href="Transverse%20Doppler%20effect">transverse redshift</a>, and a redshift:

is measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even when the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.

In the early part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to <a href="Einstein%27s%20equations">Einstein's equations</a> of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">metric expansion of space</a>. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the <a href="cosmological%20redshift">cosmological redshift</a>.

There is a distinction between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a <a href="Local%20reference%20frame">local</a> Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being a consequence of the relative velocities that are subject to the laws of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global <a href="Spacetime%20topology">feature of the spacetime</a> metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">expanding</a>. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by <a href="Lorentz%20covariance">Lorentz covariance</a>).

The observational consequences of this effect can be derived using <a href="Friedmann-Robertson-Walker%20metric">the equations</a> from <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> that describe a <a href="cosmological%20principle">homogeneous and isotropic universe</a>.

To derive the redshift effect, use the <a href="geodesic%20equation">geodesic equation</a> for a light wave, which is

where

For an observer observing the crest of a light wave at a position and time , the crest of the light wave was emitted at a time in the past and a distant position . Integrating over the path in both space and time that the light wave travels yields:

In general, the wavelength of light is not the same for the two positions and times considered due to the changing properties of the metric. When the wave was emitted, it had a wavelength . The next crest of the light wave was emitted at a time

The observer sees the next crest of the observed light wave with a wavelength to arrive at a time

Since the subsequent crest is again emitted from and is observed at , the following equation can be written:

The right-hand side of the two integral equations above are identical which means

Using the following manipulation:

we find that:

For very small variations in time (over the period of one cycle of a light wave) the scale factor is essentially a constant ( today and previously). This yields

which can be rewritten as

Using the definition of redshift provided <a href="%23Measurement%2C%20characterization%2C%20and%20interpretation">above</a>, the equation

is obtained. In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit, the scale factor is <a href="monotonic%20function">monotonically increasing</a> as time passes, thus, is positive and distant galaxies appear redshifted.

Using a model of the expansion of the Universe, redshift can be related to the age of an observed object, the so-called "<a href="cosmic%20time">cosmic time</a>–redshift relation". Denote a density ratio as :

with the critical density demarcating a universe that eventually crunches from one that simply expands. This density is about three hydrogen atoms per thousand liters of space. At large redshifts one finds:

where is the present-day <a href="Hubble%20constant">Hubble constant</a>, and is the redshift.

For cosmological redshifts of additional Doppler redshifts and blueshifts due to the <a href="peculiar%20velocity">peculiar motions</a> of the galaxies relative to one another cause a wide <a href="variance">scatter</a> from the standard <a href="Hubble%20Law">Hubble Law</a>. The resulting situation can be illustrated by the <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space%23Other%20models%20of%20expansion">Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe</a>, a common cosmological analogy used to describe the expansion of space. If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet, the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion. The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to the sheet and the sheet is stretched.

The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the Universe, and a component related to <a href="peculiar%20motion">peculiar motion</a> (Doppler shift). The redshift due to expansion of the Universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the Universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist <a href="Edward%20Robert%20Harrison">Edward Robert Harrison</a> said, "Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It is as simple as that..." <a href="Steven%20Weinberg">Steven Weinberg</a> clarified, "The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of [here is the <a href="cosmic%20scale%20factor">Robertson-Walker scale factor</a>] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of in the whole period from emission to absorption."

Popular literature often uses the expression "Doppler redshift" instead of "cosmological redshift" to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equation which is instead characterized by <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>; thus is impossible while, in contrast, is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light. More mathematically, the viewpoint that "distant galaxies are receding" and the viewpoint that "the space between galaxies is expanding" are related by changing <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinate system</a>s. Expressing this precisely requires working with the mathematics of the <a href="Friedmann-Robertson-Walker%20metric">Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric</a>.

If the Universe were contracting instead of expanding, we would see distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.

In the theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, there is time dilation within a gravitational well. This is known as the <a href="gravitational%20redshift">gravitational redshift</a> or "Einstein Shift". The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the <a href="Schwarzschild%20solution">Schwarzschild solution</a> of the <a href="Einstein%20field%20equations">Einstein equations</a> which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon traveling in the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> of an <a href="electrical%20charge">uncharged</a>, <a href="rotation">nonrotating</a>, <a href="spherical%20symmetry">spherically symmetric</a> mass:

where

This gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> and the <a href="equivalence%20principle">equivalence principle</a>; the full theory of general relativity is not required.

The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the <a href="M%C3%B6ssbauer%20effect">Mössbauer effect</a> and was first observed in the <a href="Pound%E2%80%93Rebka%20experiment">Pound–Rebka experiment</a>. However, it is significant near a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>, and as an object approaches the <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a> the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (see <a href="Sachs-Wolfe%20effect">Sachs-Wolfe effect</a>).

The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the <a href="emission%20spectrum">emission</a> and <a href="absorption%20spectrum">absorption</a> spectra for <a href="atom">atom</a>s are distinctive and well known, calibrated from <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic experiments</a> in <a href="laboratory">laboratories</a> on Earth. When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured, is found to be remarkably constant. Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by <a href="thermal%20motion">thermal</a> or <a href="motion%20%28physics%29">mechanical motion</a> of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts. Alternative hypotheses and explanations for redshift such as <a href="tired%20light">tired light</a> are not generally considered plausible.

Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a>, which measures the <a href="brightness">brightness</a> of astronomical objects through certain <a href="filter%20%28optics%29">filters</a>. When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the <a href="Hubble%20Deep%20Field">Hubble Deep Field</a> and the <a href="Hubble%20Ultra%20Deep%20Field">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a>), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring <a href="photometric%20redshift">photometric redshift</a>s. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, <a href="observational%20error">errors</a> for these sorts of measurements can range up to , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of , it would be brightest in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its <a href="blackbody%20spectrum">blackbody spectrum</a>, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, . Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See <a href="K%20correction">K correction</a> for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.)

In nearby objects (within our <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy) observed redshifts are almost always related to the <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">line-of-sight</a> velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure <a href="velocity">velocities</a> and parametrize the <a href="mass">mass</a>es of the <a href="orbit%20%28celestial%20mechanics%29">orbiting</a> <a href="star">star</a>s in <a href="spectroscopic%20binaries">spectroscopic binaries</a>, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a>. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Radial%20velocity">diagnose and measure</a> the presence and characteristics of <a href="extrasolar%20planet">planetary systems</a> around other stars and have even made very <a href="Rossiter%E2%80%93McLaughlin%20effect">detailed differential measurements</a> of redshifts during <a href="Transiting%20extrasolar%20planet">planetary transits</a> to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in <a href="helioseismology">helioseismology</a> to determine the precise movements of the <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the <a href="Period%20of%20revolution">rotation rates</a> of <a href="planet">planet</a>s, velocities of <a href="interstellar%20cloud">interstellar cloud</a>s, the <a href="galaxy%20rotation%20problem">rotation of galaxies</a>, and the <a href="dynamics%20%28mechanics%29">dynamics</a> of <a href="accretion%20theory">accretion</a> onto <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the <a href="temperature">temperature</a>s of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring <a href="Doppler%20broadening">Doppler broadening</a> – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter <a href="hydrogen%20line">hydrogen line</a> in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the <a href="recessional%20velocity">recessional velocities</a> of <a href="interstellar%20gas">interstellar gas</a>, which in turn reveals the <a href="rotation%20curve">rotation curve</a> of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as <a href="Andromeda%20%28galaxy%29">Andromeda</a>. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements are one of the most important <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">spectroscopic measurements</a> made in astronomy.

The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble flow</a> of the Universe. The largest observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>; the <a href="Hubble%27s%20law%23Redshift%20velocity">numerical value of its redshift</a> is about ( corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> about 13.8 billion years ago, and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>.

The luminous point-like cores of <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s were the first "high-redshift" () objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.

For galaxies more distant than the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a> and the nearby <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a>, but within a thousand <a href="parsec">megaparsecs</a> or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> and has come to be known as <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a>. <a href="Vesto%20Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">measured by other means</a> to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> follows in part from the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>. Because it is usually not known how <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.

<a href="Gravitation">Gravitational interactions</a> of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant <a href="variance">scatter</a> in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The <a href="peculiar%20velocity">peculiar velocities</a> associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the <a href="mass">mass</a> of <a href="virial%20theorem">virialized objects</a> in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common <a href="Barycentric%20coordinates%20%28astronomy%29">barycenter</a>, and redshift maps of clusters showing a <a href="Fingers%20of%20God">Fingers of God</a> effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the "<a href="mass%20to%20light%20ratio">mass to light ratio</a>" (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>.

The Hubble law's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the Universe is constant. However, when the Universe was much younger, the expansion rate, and thus the Hubble "constant", was larger than it is today. For more distant galaxies, then, whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times, the approximation of constant expansion rate fails, and the Hubble law becomes a non-linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question. Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used, then, to determine the expansion history of the Universe and thus the matter and energy content.

While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a>e have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has <a href="Accelerating%20universe">begun to accelerate</a>.

Currently, the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts. The most reliable redshifts are from <a href="spectroscopic">spectroscopic</a> data, and the highest confirmed <a href="spectroscopic">spectroscopic</a> redshift of a galaxy is that of <a href="GN-z11">GN-z11</a>, with a redshift of , corresponding to 400 million years after the Big Bang. The previous record was held by 
<a href="UDFy-38135539">UDFy-38135539</a> at a redshift of , corresponding to 600 million years after the Big Bang. Slightly less reliable are <a href="Lyman-break%20galaxy">Lyman-break</a> redshifts, the highest of which is the lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 at a redshift and the next highest being . The most distant observed <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a> with a spectroscopic redshift measurement was <a href="GRB%20090423">GRB 090423</a>, which had a redshift of . The most distant known quasar, <a href="ULAS%20J1342%2B0928">ULAS J1342+0928</a>, is at . The highest known redshift radio galaxy (TN J0924-2201) is at a redshift and the highest known redshift molecular material is the detection of emission from the CO molecule from the quasar SDSS J1148+5251 at 

"Extremely red objects" (EROs) are <a href="Radio%20astronomy%23Astronomical%20sources">astronomical sources</a> of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These may be starburst galaxies that have a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust, or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older (and therefore redder) stellar population. Objects that are even redder than EROs are termed "hyper extremely red objects" (HEROs).

The <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> has a redshift of , corresponding to an age of approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang and a <a href="comoving%20distance">comoving distance</a> of more than 46 billion light years. The yet-to-be-observed first light from the oldest <a href="Population%20III%20stars">Population III stars</a>, not long after atoms first formed and the CMB ceased to be absorbed almost completely, may have redshifts in the range of . Other high-redshift events predicted by physics but not presently observable are the <a href="cosmic%20neutrino%20background">cosmic neutrino background</a> from about two seconds after the Big Bang (and a redshift in excess of ) and the <a href="cosmic%20gravitational%20wave%20background">cosmic gravitational wave background</a> emitted directly from <a href="inflation%20%28cosmology%29">inflation</a> at a redshift in excess of .

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for <a href="Metallicity%23Population%20III%20stars">Population III stars</a> in the <a href="Cosmos%20Redshift%207">Cosmos Redshift 7</a> <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a> at . Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started the production of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s heavier than <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> that are needed for the later formation of <a href="planet">planet</a>s and <a href="life">life</a> as we know it.

With advent of automated <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s and improvements in <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">spectroscopes</a>, a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the <a href="large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large-scale structure</a> of the Universe. The <a href="Great%20Wall%20%28astronomy%29">Great Wall</a>, a vast <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a> of galaxies over 500 million <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.

The first redshift survey was the <a href="CfA%20Redshift%20Survey">CfA Redshift Survey</a>, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. More recently, the <a href="2dF%20Galaxy%20Redshift%20Survey">2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey</a> determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring redshifts for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final <a href="data%20set">data set</a> was released 30 June 2003. The <a href="Sloan%20Digital%20Sky%20Survey">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> (SDSS), is ongoing as of 2013 and aims to measure the redshifts of around 3 million objects. SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.8, and has been involved in the detection of <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s beyond . The <a href="DEEP2%20Redshift%20Survey">DEEP2 Redshift Survey</a> uses the <a href="Keck%20telescopes">Keck telescopes</a> with the new "DEIMOS" <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a>; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a high redshift complement to SDSS and 2dF.

The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of <a href="radiative%20transfer">radiative transfer</a> and <a href="physical%20optics">physical optics</a> can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Such shifts can be from such physical phenomena as <a href="Wolf%20effect">coherence effects</a> or the <a href="scattering">scattering</a> of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> whether from <a href="electric%20charge">charged</a> <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the <a href="index%20of%20refraction">index of refraction</a> in a <a href="dielectric%20medium">dielectric medium</a> as occurs in the radio phenomenon of <a href="Whistler%20%28radio%29">radio whistlers</a>. While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as "redshifts" and "blueshifts", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as "reddening" rather than "redshifting" which, as a term, is normally reserved for the <a href="%23Redshift%20formulae">effects discussed above</a>.

In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because <a href="entropy">entropy</a> results in the predominance of many low-<a href="energy">energy</a> photons over few high-energy ones (while <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conserving total energy</a>). Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated is generally a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from <a href="randomness">random</a> <a href="matter">media</a> generally occurs at many <a href="angle">angle</a>s, and is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s as well.

In <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar astronomy</a>, <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectra</a> can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as <a href="interstellar%20reddening">interstellar reddening</a> – similarly <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a> causes the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmospheric</a> reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from red"shift"ing because the <a href="atomic%20spectral%20line">spectroscopic lines</a> are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional <a href="extinction%20%28astronomy%29">dimming</a> and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">line-of-sight</a>.

Rhys ap Gruffydd

Rhys ap Gruffydd or ap Gruffudd (often anglicised to "Griffith") (1132 – 28 April 1197) was the ruler of the kingdom of <a href="Deheubarth">Deheubarth</a> in south <a href="Wales">Wales</a> from 1155 to 1197. Today, he is commonly known as The Lord Rhys, in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "Yr Arglwydd Rhys", although this title may have not been used in his lifetime. He usually used the title "Proprietary Prince of <a href="Deheubarth">Deheubarth</a>" or "Prince of South Wales", but two documents have been discovered in which he uses the title "<a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>" or "<a href="King%20of%20the%20Britons">Prince of the Welsh</a>". Rhys was one of the most successful and powerful <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> princes, and, after the death of <a href="Owain%20Gwynedd">Owain Gwynedd</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a> in 1170, the dominant power in Wales.

Rhys's grandfather, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Tewdwr">Rhys ap Tewdwr</a>, was king of Deheubarth, and was killed at <a href="Brecon">Brecon</a> in 1093 by <a href="Bernard%20de%20Neufmarch%C3%A9">Bernard de Neufmarché</a>. Following his death, most of Deheubarth was taken over by the <a href="Normans">Normans</a>. Rhys's father, <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys">Gruffydd ap Rhys</a>, eventually was able to become ruler of a small portion, and more territory was won back by Rhys's older brothers after Gruffydd's death. Rhys became ruler of Deheubarth in 1155. He was forced to submit to King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> in 1158. Henry invaded Deheubarth in 1163, stripped Rhys of all his lands and took him prisoner. A few weeks later he was released and given back a small part of his holdings. Rhys made an alliance with Owain Gwynedd and, after the failure of another invasion of Wales by Henry in 1165, was able to win back most of his lands.

In 1171 Rhys made peace with King Henry and was confirmed in possession of his recent conquests as well as being named <a href="Justiciar%20of%20South%20Wales">Justiciar of South Wales</a>. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter's death in 1189. Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly <a href="Maelgwn%20ap%20Rhys">Maelgwn</a> and <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys%20II">Gruffydd</a>, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in <a href="St%20David%27s%20Cathedral">St David's Cathedral</a>.

Rhys was the second son of <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys">Gruffydd ap Rhys</a>, ruler of part of <a href="Deheubarth">Deheubarth</a>, by his second wife <a href="Gwenllian%20ferch%20Gruffydd">Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd</a>, daughter of <a href="Gruffudd%20ap%20Cynan">Gruffudd ap Cynan</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">king of Gwynedd</a>. His elder brother was <a href="Maredudd%20ap%20Gruffydd">Maredudd ap Gruffydd</a>, and there were two younger brothers, Morgan and Maelgwn. He also had two older half-brothers, <a href="Anarawd%20ap%20Gruffydd">Anarawd</a> and <a href="Cadell%20ap%20Gruffydd">Cadell</a>, from his father's first marriage. Rhys married <a href="Gwenllian%20ferch%20Madog">Gwenllian ferch Madog</a>, daughter of <a href="Madog%20ap%20Maredudd">Madog ap Maredudd</a>, the last Prince of all Powys.
His grandfather, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Tewdwr">Rhys ap Tewdwr</a>, had been king of all Deheubarth until his death in 1093. Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed in Brycheiniog, and most of his kingdom was taken over by Norman lords. Gruffydd ap Rhys was forced to flee to <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>. He later returned to Deheubarth and ruled a portion of the kingdom, but was forced to flee to Ireland again in 1127. When Rhys was born in 1132, his father held only the <a href="commote">commote</a> of Caeo in <a href="Cantref%20Mawr">Cantref Mawr</a>.

The death of King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>, and <a href="the%20Anarchy">the ensuing Anarchy</a> arising from the rival claims of <a href="Stephen%20of%20Blois">Stephen</a> and <a href="Empress%20Maud">Matilda</a> to the English throne, gave the Welsh the opportunity to rise against the Normans. A revolt spread through south Wales in 1136, and Gruffydd ap Rhys, aided by his two eldest sons, Anarawd and Cadell, defeated the Normans in a battle near <a href="Loughor">Loughor</a>, killing over five hundred. After driving <a href="Walter%20de%20Clifford%20%28died%201190%29">Walter de Clifford</a> out of Cantref Bychan, Gruffydd set off to Gwynedd to enlist the help of his father-in-law, Gruffudd ap Cynan. In the absence of her husband, Gwenllian led an army against the Norman lordship of Cydweli (Kidwelly), taking along her two youngest sons, Morgan and Maelgwn. She was defeated and killed by an army commanded by Maurice de Londres of <a href="Oystermouth%20Castle">Oystermouth Castle</a>. Morgan was also killed and Maelgwn captured.

Gruffydd formed an alliance with Gwynedd, and later in 1136 the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, Owain Gwynedd and <a href="Cadwaladr%20ap%20Gruffydd">Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd</a>, led an army to Ceredigion. Their combined forces won a decisive victory over the Normans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crug%20Mawr">Battle of Crug Mawr</a>. Ceredigion was reclaimed from the Normans, but was annexed by Gwynedd as the senior partner in the alliance. Gruffydd ap Rhys continued his campaign against the Normans in 1137, but died later that year. The leadership of the family now passed to Rhys's half-brother Anarawd ap Gruffydd. In 1143, when Rhys was eleven, Anarawd was murdered by the bodyguard of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, brother of Owain Gwynedd, king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>. Owain punished Cadwaladr by depriving him of his lands in Ceredigion.

Anarawd's brother, <a href="Cadell%20ap%20Gruffydd">Cadell ap Gruffydd</a>, took over as head of the family. <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Gilbert de Clare</a>, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen castle in 1145 then began a campaign to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the <a href="commote">commote</a> of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by <a href="Hywel%20ab%20Owain%20Gwynedd">Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd</a> who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals for the first time in 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of <a href="Llansteffan%20Castle">Llansteffan Castle</a>. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, <a href="Carmarthen">Carmarthen</a> in 1150 and <a href="Loughor">Loughor</a> in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from <a href="Tenby">Tenby</a>, and left for dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>.

Maredudd became ruler of Deheubarth and continued a campaign, begun in 1150, aimed at recovering <a href="Ceredigion">Ceredigion</a>, which had been held by Gwynedd since 1136. Maredudd and Rhys were able to drive <a href="Hywel%20ab%20Owain%20Gwynedd">Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd</a> from Ceredigion by 1153. The same year Rhys is recorded as an independent commander for the first time, leading an army to capture the Norman castle of <a href="St%20Clears">St Clears</a>. Maredudd and Rhys also destroyed the castles at <a href="Tenby%20Castle">Tenby</a> and <a href="Aberavon">Aberafan</a> that year. Maredudd died in 1155 at the age of twenty-five and left Rhys as ruler of Deheubarth. Around this time he married Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of <a href="Madog%20ap%20Maredudd">Madog ap Maredudd</a>, prince of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">Powys</a>.

Shortly after becoming ruler of Deheubarth, Rhys heard rumours that Owain Gwynedd was planning to invade Ceredigion in order to reclaim it for Gwynedd. Rhys responded by building a castle at <a href="Aberdyfi%20Castle">Aberdyfi</a> in 1156. The threatened invasion did not take place, and Turvey claims that Owain's intention may have been to test the resolve of the new ruler.

<a href="Stephen%20of%20England">King Stephen</a> had died in October 1154, bringing to an end the long dispute with the <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a> which had helped Anarawd, Cadell and Maredudd to extend their rule in Deheubarth. With disunity within the realm no longer a problem, the new king of England, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, soon turned his attention to Wales. He began with an invasion of Gwynedd in 1157. This invasion was not entirely successful, but Owain Gwynedd was induced to seek terms and to give up some territory in the north-east of Wales.

The following year, Henry prepared an invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys made plans to resist, but was persuaded by his council to meet the king to discuss peace terms. The terms were much harsher than those offered to Owain: Rhys was stripped of all his possessions apart from <a href="Cantref%20Mawr">Cantref Mawr</a>, though he was promised one other cantref. The other territories were returned to their Norman lords.

Among the Normans who returned to their holdings was <a href="Walter%20de%20Clifford%20%28died%201190%29">Walter de Clifford</a>, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys's lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at <a href="Llandovery">Llandovery</a> then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.

The king was absent in France in 1159, and Rhys took the opportunity to attack Dyfed and then to lay siege to Carmarthen, which was saved by a relief force led by <a href="Reginald%20de%20Dunstanville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Earl Reginald of Cornwall</a>. Rhys retreated to Cantref Mawr, where an army led by five earls, the Earls of Cornwall, <a href="William%20Fitz%20Robert%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Roger%20de%20Clare%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Hertford">Hertford</a>, <a href="Richard%20de%20Clare%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Pembroke</a> and Salisbury, marched against him. The earls were assisted by Cadwaladr, brother of Owain Gwynedd, and Owain's sons, Hywel and Cynan. However they were forced to withdraw and a truce was arranged. In 1162, Rhys again attempted to recover some of his lost lands, and captured <a href="Llandovery">Llandovery</a> castle. The following year Henry II returned to England after an absence of four years and prepared for another invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys met the king to discuss terms and was obliged to give more hostages, including another son, Maredudd. He was then seized and taken to England as a prisoner. Henry appears to have been uncertain what to do with Rhys, but after a few weeks decided to free him and allow him to rule Cantref Mawr. Rhys was summoned to appear before Henry at Woodstock to do homage together with Owain Gwynedd and <a href="Malcolm%20IV%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm IV of Scotland</a>.

In 1164 all the Welsh princes united in an uprising. Warren suggests that when Rhys and Owain were obliged to do homage to Henry in 1163 they were forced to accept a status of dependent vassalage instead of their previous client status, and that this led to the revolt. Rhys had other reasons for rebellion, for he had returned to Deheubarth from England to find that the neighbouring Norman lords were threatening Cantref Mawr. His nephew, <a href="Einion%20ab%20Anarawd">Einion ab Anarawd</a>, who was the captain of his bodyguard, had been murdered at the instigation of <a href="Roger%20de%20Clare%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Hertford">Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford</a>. The murderer had been given the protection of the Clares in Ceredigion. Rhys first appealed to the king to intercede; when this failed, he invaded Ceredigion and recaptured all of it apart from the town and castle of Cardigan. The Welsh revolt led to another invasion of Wales by King Henry in 1165. Henry attacked Gwynedd first, but instead of following the usual invasion route along the north coast he attacked from the south, following a route over the <a href="Berwyn%20range">Berwyn hills</a>. He was met by the united forces of the Welsh princes, led by Owain Gwynedd and including Rhys. According to "<a href="Brut%20y%20Tywysogion">Brut y Tywysogion</a>":

Torrential rain forced Henry's army to retreat in disorder without fighting a major battle, and Henry vented his spleen on the hostages, having Rhys's son Maredudd blinded. Rhys's other son, Hywel, was not among the victims. Rhys returned to Deheubarth where he captured and burned <a href="Cardigan%20Castle">Cardigan Castle</a>. He allowed the garrison to depart, but held the castellan, <a href="Robert%20Fitz-Stephen">Robert Fitz-Stephen</a>, as a prisoner. Shortly afterwards Rhys captured Cilgerran castle.

In 1167 he joined Owain Gwynedd in an attack on <a href="Owain%20Cyfeiliog">Owain Cyfeiliog</a> of southern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">Powys</a>, and spent three weeks helping Owain besiege the Norman castle of <a href="Rhuddlan%20Castle">Rhuddlan</a>. In 1168 he attacked the Normans at <a href="Builth">Builth</a>, destroying its castle. Rhys benefited from the Norman invasion of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1169 and 1170, which was largely led by the <a href="Cambro-Norman">Cambro-Norman</a> lords of south Wales. In 1167 the King of <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a>, <a href="Diarmait%20Mac%20Murchada">Diarmait Mac Murchada</a>, who had been driven out of his kingdom, had asked Rhys to release Robert Fitz-Stephen from captivity to take part in an expedition to Ireland. Rhys did not oblige at the time, but released him the following year and in 1169 Fitz-Stephen led the vanguard of a Norman army which landed in <a href="County%20Wexford">Wexford</a>. The leader of the Norman forces, <a href="Richard%20de%20Clare%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke</a>, known as "Strongbow", followed in 1170. According to Warren:

The departure of the Norman lords enabled Rhys to strengthen his position, and the death of Owain Gwynedd in late 1170 left him as the acknowledged leader of the Welsh princes.

In 1171 King Henry II arrived in England from France, on his way to Ireland. Henry wished to ensure that Richard de Clare, who had married Diarmait's daughter and become heir to Leinster, did not establish an independent Norman kingdom in Ireland. His decision to try a different approach in his dealings with the Welsh was influenced by the events in Ireland, although Warren suggests that "it seems likely that Henry began rethinking his attitude to the Welsh soon after the débâcle of 1165". Henry now wished to make peace with Rhys, who came to <a href="Newnham%20on%20Severn">Newnham</a> to meet him. Rhys was to pay a tribute of 300 horses and 4,000 head of cattle, but was confirmed in possession of all the lands he had taken from Norman lords, including the Clares. They met again in October that year at <a href="Pembroke%2C%20Pembrokeshire">Pembroke</a> as Henry waited to cross to Ireland. Rhys had collected 86 of the 300 horses, but Henry agreed to take only 36 of them and remitted the remainder of the tribute until after his return from Ireland. Rhys's son, Hywel, who had been held as a hostage for many years, was returned to him. Henry and Rhys met once more at <a href="Laugharne">Laugharne</a> as Henry returned from Ireland in 1172, and shortly afterwards Henry appointed Rhys "justice on his behalf in all Deheubarth". According to A. D. Carr:

The agreement between Henry and Rhys was to last until Henry's death in 1189. When Henry's sons rebelled against him in 1173 Rhys sent his son Hywel Sais to Normandy to aid the king, then in 1174 personally led an army to <a href="Tutbury">Tutbury</a> in Staffordshire to assist at the siege of the stronghold of the rebel Earl <a href="William%20de%20Ferrers%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Derby">William de Ferrers</a>. When Rhys returned to Wales after the fall of Tutbury, he left a thousand men with the king for service in Normandy. King Henry held a council at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> in 1175 which was attended by a large gathering of Welsh princes, led by Rhys. It appears to have concluded with the swearing of a mutual assistance pact for the preservation of peace and order in Wales. In 1177 Rhys, <a href="Dafydd%20ab%20Owain%20Gwynedd">Dafydd ab Owain</a>, who had emerged as the main power in Gwynedd, and <a href="Cadwallon%20ap%20Madog">Cadwallon ap Madog</a> from <a href="Rhwng%20Gwy%20a%20Hafren">Rhwng Gwy a Hafren</a> swore fealty and liege homage to Henry at a council held at Oxford. At this council the king gave Meirionnydd, part of the kingdom of Gwynedd, to Rhys. There was some fighting in Meirionnydd the following year, but Rhys apparently made no serious attempt to annex it.

Rhys built a number of stone castles, starting with <a href="Cardigan%2C%20Ceredigion">Cardigan</a> castle, which was the earliest recorded native-built stone castle in Wales. He also built <a href="Carreg%20Cennen%20castle">Carreg Cennen castle</a> near Llandeilo, a castle set in a spectacular position on a mountain top. He held a <a href="1176%20Cardigan%20eisteddfod">festival of poetry and song at his court at Cardigan over Christmas 1176</a>. This is generally regarded as the first recorded <a href="Eisteddfod">Eisteddfod</a>. The festival was announced a year in advance throughout Wales and in <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and possibly <a href="France">France</a>. Two chairs were awarded as prizes, one for the best poem and the other for the best musical performance. J. E. Caerwyn Williams suggests that this event may be an adaptation of the similar French "<a href="Puy%20%28society%29">puys</a>". R.R. Davies suggests that the texts of <a href="Welsh%20law">Welsh law</a>, traditionally codified by <a href="Hywel%20Dda">Hywel Dda</a> at Whitland, were first assembled in book form under the aegis of Rhys.
Rhys founded two religious houses during this period. <a href="Talley%20Abbey">Talley Abbey</a> was the first <a href="Premonstratensian">Premonstratensian</a> abbey in Wales, while Llanllyr was a <a href="Cistercian%20nunnery">Cistercian nunnery</a>, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper. He became the patron of the abbeys of <a href="Whitland%20Abbey">Whitland</a> and <a href="Strata%20Florida%20Abbey">Strata Florida</a> and made large grants to both houses. <a href="Giraldus%20Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, who was related to Rhys, gives an account of his meetings with Rhys in 1188 when Giraldus accompanied Archbishop Baldwin around Wales to raise men for the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>. Some Welsh clerics were not happy about this visit, but Rhys was enthusiastic and gave the Archbishop a great deal of assistance. Giraldus says that Rhys decided to go on crusade himself and spent several weeks making preparations, but was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his wife Gwenllian, "by female artifices".

<a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> died in 1189 and was succeeded by <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>. Rhys considered that he was no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged <a href="Pembroke%2C%20Pembrokeshire">Pembroke</a>, <a href="Haverfordwest">Haverfordwest</a>, and <a href="Lordship%20of%20Gower">Gower</a> and captured the castles of St. Clear's, <a href="Laugharne%20Castle">Laugharne</a>, and <a href="Llansteffan%20Castle">Llansteffan</a>. Richard's brother, Prince John (later <a href="John%20of%20England">King John</a>), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of <a href="Carmarthen">Carmarthen</a> and accompany him to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.

In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly <a href="Maelgwn%20ap%20Rhys">Maelgwn</a> and <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys%20II">Gruffydd</a>. In 1189 Gruffydd persuaded Rhys to imprison Maelgwn, and he was given into Gruffydd's keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffydd handed him over to his father-in-law, <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%204th%20Lord%20of%20Bramber">William de Braose</a>. Gruffydd is also said to have persuaded his father to annex the lordship of <a href="Cemais%20%28Dyfed%20cantref%29">Cemais</a> and its chief castle of <a href="Nevern">Nevern</a>, held by William <a href="FitzMartin">FitzMartin</a>, in 1191. This action was criticized by <a href="Giraldus%20Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, who describes Gruffydd as "a cunning and artful man". William FitzMartin was married to Rhys's daughter Angharad, and, according to Giraldus, Rhys "had solemnly sworn, by the most precious relics, that his indemnity and security should be faithfully maintained". Rhys had also annexed the Norman lordships of Cydweli and Carnwyllion in 1190. In 1192 Rhys secured Maelgwn's release, but by now Maelgwn and Gruffydd were bitter enemies. In 1194 Rhys was defeated in battle by Maelgwn and Hywel, who imprisoned him in <a href="Nevern">Nevern</a> castle, though Hywel later released his father without Maelgwn's consent. Giraldus suggests that Rhys's incarceration in Nevern castle was divine vengeance for the dispossession of William <a href="FitzMartin">FitzMartin</a>. In 1195 two other sons, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd, seized Llanymddyfri and Dinefwr, and Rhys responded by imprisoning them. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196. He captured a number of castles, including <a href="Carmarthen%20Castle">Carmarthen</a>, <a href="Colwyn%20Castle">Colwyn</a>, <a href="Radnor%20Castle">Radnor</a> and <a href="Painscastle%20Castle">Painscastle</a>, and defeated an army led by <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%20of%20Wigmore">Roger de Mortimer</a> and Hugh de Say near <a href="Radnorshire">Radnor</a>, with forty knights among the dead. This was Rhys' last battle. William de Braose offered terms, and Painscastle was returned to him.

In April 1197 Rhys died unexpectedly and was buried in <a href="St%20David%27s%20Cathedral">St David's Cathedral</a>. The chronicler of "<a href="Brut%20y%20Tywysogion">Brut y Tywysogion</a>" records for 1197:

Rhys died excommunicate, having quarreled with the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St.%20David%27s">Bishop of St. David's</a>, <a href="Peter%20de%20Leia">Peter de Leia</a>, over the theft of some of the bishop's horses some years previously. Before he could be buried in the cathedral, the bishop had his corpse <a href="scourged">scourged</a> in posthumous penance.

Rhys had nominated his eldest legitimate son, Gruffydd ap Rhys, as his successor, and soon after his father's death Gruffydd met the Justiciar, Archbishop <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, on the border and was confirmed as heir. Maelgwn, the eldest son but illegitimate, refused to accept this and was given military assistance by <a href="Gwenwynwyn%20ab%20Owain">Gwenwynwyn ab Owain</a> of Powys. Maelgwn took the town and castle of <a href="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> and captured Gruffydd, whom he handed over to the custody of Gwenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn later handed him over to the king, who imprisoned him at <a href="Corfe%20Castle">Corfe Castle</a>. Gruffydd was set free the following year and regained most of Ceredigion. In 1201 Gruffydd died, but this did not end the fighting between rival claimants. In 1216 <a href="Llywelyn%20the%20Great">Llywelyn the Great</a> of Gwynedd held a council at Aberdyfi where he allocated parts of Deheubarth to several sons and grandsons of Rhys.

Giraldus Cambrensis frequently mentions Rhys in his writings and describes him as "a man of excellent wit and quick in repartee". Gerald tells the story of a banquet at Hereford in 1186 where Rhys sat between two members of the Clare family. What could have been a tense affair, since Rhys had seized lands in Ceredigion previously held by the Clare family, passed off with an exchange of courteous compliments, followed by some good-natured banter between Rhys and Gerald about their family connections. Rhys gave Gerald and Archbishop Baldwin a great deal of assistance when they visited Wales to raise troops for the crusade in 1188, and Gerald several times refers to his "kindness" and says that Rhys accompanied them all the way from Cardigan to the northern border of Ceredigion "with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy in so illustrious a prince".

Another contemporary writer also wrote of Rhys if Roger Turvey is correct in stating that <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a>'s piece "Of the King Appollonides" deals with Rhys under a pseudonym. Map was less favourably disposed toward Rhys, describing him as "This king I have seen and know, and hate", but goes on to say "I would not have my hatred blacken his worth; it is not my wish ever to suppress any man's excellence through envy". He tells the following story about Apollonides/Rhys:

Davies provides the following assessment of Rhys:

Davies also notes two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the personal nature of his accord with Henry II, which meant that it did not survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to control his sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.

Rhys had at least nine sons and eight daughters. Confusingly, three of the sons were named Maredudd and two of the daughters were named Gwenllian.

Star

A star is type of <a href="astronomical%20object">astronomical object</a> consisting of a luminous <a href="spheroid">spheroid</a> of <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> held together by its own <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. The nearest star to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> is the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of <a href="Fixed%20stars">fixed</a> luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s and <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterisms</a>, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a>s that identify the known stars and provide standardized <a href="stellar%20designation">stellar designation</a>s. However, most of the estimated 300 <a href="sextillion">sextillion</a> () stars in the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a>, the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to <a href="thermonuclear%20fusion">thermonuclear fusion</a> of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> into <a href="helium">helium</a> in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then <a href="radiation">radiates</a> into <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by <a href="supernova%20nucleosynthesis">supernova nucleosynthesis</a> when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain <a href="degenerate%20matter">degenerate matter</a>. <a href="Astronomer">Astronomer</a>s can determine the <a href="stellar%20mass">mass</a>, age, <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>, and <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">spectrum</a> respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its <a href="stellar%20evolution">evolution</a> and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a <a href="Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung–Russell diagram</a> (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.

A star's life <a href="star%20formation">begins</a> with the <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> of a gaseous <a href="nebula">nebula</a> of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process. The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of <a href="radiation">radiative</a> and <a href="convection">convective</a> <a href="heat%20transfer">heat transfer</a> processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> when the hydrogen <a href="fuel">fuel</a> in its core is exhausted. In some cases, it will fuse heavier <a href="chemical%20element">elements</a> at the core or in shells around the core. As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars. Meanwhile, the core becomes a <a href="stellar%20remnant">stellar remnant</a>: a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>, a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>, or if it is sufficiently massive a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>.

<a href="Binary%20star">Binary</a> and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a> or a galaxy.

Historically, stars have been important to <a href="civilization">civilization</a>s throughout the world. They have been part of religious practices and used for <a href="celestial%20navigation">celestial navigation</a> and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a <a href="heavenly%20sphere">heavenly sphere</a> and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s and used them to track the motions of the <a href="planets">planets</a> and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create <a href="solar%20calendar">calendars</a>, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a <a href="solar%20calendar">solar calendar</a> based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.

The oldest accurately dated <a href="star%20chart">star chart</a> was the result of ancient <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy">Egyptian astronomy</a> in 1534 BC. The <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">earliest known star catalogues</a> were compiled by the ancient <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Babylonian astronomers</a> of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the <a href="Kassites">Kassite Period</a> (c. 1531–1155 BC).

The first <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20astronomy">Greek astronomy</a> was created by <a href="Aristillus">Aristillus</a> in approximately 300 BC, with the help of <a href="Timocharis">Timocharis</a>. The star catalog of <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s star catalogue. Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded "<a href="nova">nova</a>" (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.

In spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens, <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomers</a> were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>, now known as the <a href="SN%20185">SN 185</a>. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the <a href="SN%201006">SN 1006</a> supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer <a href="Ali%20ibn%20Ridwan">Ali ibn Ridwan</a> and several Chinese astronomers. The <a href="SN%201054">SN 1054</a> supernova, which gave birth to the <a href="Crab%20Nebula">Crab Nebula</a>, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.

<a href="Astronomy%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Medieval Islamic astronomers</a> gave <a href="list%20of%20Arabic%20star%20names">Arabic names to many stars</a> that are still used today and they invented numerous <a href="astronomy%20in%20medieval%20Islam%23Instruments">astronomical instruments</a> that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large <a href="observatory">observatory</a> research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing "<a href="Zij">Zij</a>" star catalogues. Among these, the "<a href="Book%20of%20Fixed%20Stars">Book of Fixed Stars</a>" (964) was written by the <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> astronomer <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Sufi">Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi</a>, who observed a number of stars, <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>s (including the <a href="Omicron%20Velorum">Omicron Velorum</a> and <a href="Brocchi%27s%20Cluster">Brocchi's Cluster</a>s) and <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a> (including the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian <a href="polymath">polymath</a> scholar <a href="Abu%20Rayhan%20Biruni">Abu Rayhan Biruni</a> described the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of <a href="nebula">nebulous</a> stars, and also gave the <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s of various stars during a <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> in 1019.

According to Josep Puig, the <a href="Al-Andalus">Andalusian</a> astronomer <a href="Ibn%20Bajjah">Ibn Bajjah</a> proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of <a href="refraction">refraction</a> from sublunary material, citing his observation of the <a href="conjunction%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">conjunction</a> of Jupiter and Mars on 500 <a href="Islamic%20calendar">AH</a> (1106/1107 AD) as evidence. 
Early European astronomers such as <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> identified new stars in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a> (later termed "novae"), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584, <a href="Giordano%20Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have <a href="extrasolar%20planet">other planets</a>, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophers</a>, <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> and <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a>, and by medieval <a href="Cosmology%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Islamic cosmologists</a> such as <a href="Fakhr%20al-Din%20al-Razi">Fakhr al-Din al-Razi</a>. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian <a href="Richard%20Bentley">Richard Bentley</a>.

The Italian astronomer <a href="Geminiano%20Montanari">Geminiano Montanari</a> recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star <a href="Algol">Algol</a> in 1667. <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> published the first measurements of the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of a pair of nearby "fixed" stars, demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus.

<a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way <a href="Galactic%20Center">core</a>. His son <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.

The science of <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">stellar spectroscopy</a> was pioneered by <a href="Joseph%20von%20Fraunhofer">Joseph von Fraunhofer</a> and <a href="Angelo%20Secchi">Angelo Secchi</a>. By comparing the spectra of stars such as <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their <a href="spectral%20line">absorption lines</a>—the dark lines in stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865, Secchi began classifying stars into <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral types</a>. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by <a href="Annie%20Jump%20Cannon">Annie J. Cannon</a> during the 1900s.
The first direct measurement of the distance to a star (<a href="61%20Cygni">61 Cygni</a> at 11.4 <a href="light-years">light-years</a>) was made in 1838 by <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a> using the <a href="parallax">parallax</a> technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. <a href="Edward%20Charles%20Pickering">Edward Pickering</a> discovered the first <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star <a href="Mizar%20%28star%29">Mizar</a> in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as <a href="Friedrich%20Georg%20Wilhelm%20von%20Struve">Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve</a> and <a href="Sherburne%20Wesley%20Burnham">S. W. Burnham</a>, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of <a href="orbital%20elements">orbital elements</a>. The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.
The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The <a href="photograph">photograph</a> became a valuable astronomical tool. <a href="Karl%20Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a> discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the <a href="visual%20magnitude">visual magnitude</a> against the <a href="photographic%20magnitude">photographic magnitude</a>. The development of the <a href="Photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric</a> <a href="photometer">photometer</a> allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 <a href="Albert%20A.%20Michelson">Albert A. Michelson</a> made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an <a href="interferometer">interferometer</a> on the <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory%23Hooker%20telescope">Hooker telescope</a> at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>.

Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a> was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful <a href="Stellar%20model">models</a> were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. <a href="Cecilia%20Payne-Gaposchkin">Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</a> first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum physics</a>. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.
With the exception of supernovae, individual stars have primarily been observed in the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a>, and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for our
galaxy). But some stars have been observed in the M100 galaxy of the <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a>, about 100 million light years from the Earth.
In the <a href="Local%20Supercluster">Local Supercluster</a> it is possible to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see <a href="Cepheids">Cepheids</a>). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.

In February 2018, astronomers reported, for the first time, a signal of the <a href="reionization">reionization</a> epoch, an indirect detection of light from the earliest stars formed—about 180 million years after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>.

In April, 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant "ordinary" (i.e., <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>) star, named <a href="Icarus%20%28star%29">Icarus</a> (formally, <a href="MACS%20J1149%20Lensed%20Star%201">MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1</a>), at 9 billion light-years away from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>.

In May 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant oxygen ever detected in the Universe—and the most distant galaxy ever observed by <a href="Atacama%20Large%20Millimeter%20Array">Atacama Large Millimeter Array</a> or the <a href="Very%20Large%20Telescope">Very Large Telescope</a>—with the team inferring that the signal was emitted 13.3 billion years ago (or 500 million years after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>. They found that the observed brightness of the galaxy is well-explained by a model where the onset of star formation corresponds to only 250 million years after the Universe began, corresponding to a <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of about 15.

The concept of a constellation was known to exist during the <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>ian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> and these became the basis of <a href="astrology">astrology</a>. Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with <a href="Arab%20language">Arabic</a> or <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> designations.

As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own <a href="mythology">myths</a>. To the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion">Ancient Greeks</a>, some "stars", known as <a href="planet">planet</a>s (Greek πλανήτης (planētēs), meaning "wanderer"), represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>, <a href="Venus">Venus</a>, <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> were taken. (<a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> were also <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman gods</a>, but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.)

Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as <a href="Bayer%20designation">designations</a> to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the star's <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> was invented and added to <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>'s star catalogue in his book ""Historia coelestis Britannica"" (the 1712 edition), whereby this numbering system came to be called "<a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a>" or "Flamsteed numbering".

The only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> calls an <a href="regulation">unregulated</a> <a href="commercial%20enterprise">commercial enterprise</a>. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither recognized by the IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the <a href="International%20Star%20Registry">International Star Registry</a>, which, during the 1980s, was accused of <a href="deceptive%20practice">deceptive practice</a> for making it appear that the assigned name was <a href="official%23Adjective">official</a>. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Consumer%20Affairs">New York City Department of Consumer Affairs</a> issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.

Although stellar parameters can be expressed in <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI units</a> or <a href="CGS%20unit">CGS unit</a>s, it is often most convenient to express <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>, and <a href="radius">radii</a> in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun. In 2015, the IAU defined a set of "nominal" solar values (defined as SI constants, without uncertainties) which can be used for quoting stellar parameters:

The <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a> M was not explicitly defined by the IAU due to the large relative uncertainty (10) of the <a href="Gravitational%20Constant">Newtonian gravitational constant</a> G. However, since the product of the Newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass
together (GM) has been determined to much greater precision, the IAU defined the "nominal" solar mass parameter to be:

However, one can combine the nominal solar mass parameter with the most recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 10 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.

Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the <a href="Semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes">semi-major axis</a> of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>—approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the <a href="astronomical%20constant">astronomical constant</a> to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.

Stars condense from regions of <a href="interstellar%20medium">space</a> of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a <a href="vacuum%20chamber">vacuum chamber</a>. These regions—known as "<a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>s"—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a>. Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.
<a href="O-type%20star">Massive stars</a> in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds, <a href="ion">ion</a>izing the hydrogen, and creating <a href="H%20II%20region">H II region</a>s. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.

All stars spend the majority of their existence as "<a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> stars", fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly, astronomers often group stars by their mass:

The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density—often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the <a href="Interacting%20galaxy">collision of galaxies</a> (as in a <a href="starburst%20galaxy">starburst galaxy</a>). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for <a href="Jeans%20instability">Jeans instability</a>, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.

As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form "<a href="Bok%20globule">Bok globule</a>s". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of <a href="hydrostatic%20equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>, a <a href="protostar">protostar</a> forms at the core. These <a href="pre-main-sequence%20star">pre-main-sequence star</a>s are often surrounded by a <a href="protoplanetary%20disk">protoplanetary disk</a> and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.
Early stars of less than 2 are called <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri star</a>s, while those with greater mass are <a href="Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star">Herbig Ae/Be star</a>s. These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as <a href="Herbig%E2%80%93Haro%20object">Herbig–Haro object</a>s.
These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.

Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the <a href="Hayashi%20track">Hayashi track</a>—they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the <a href="Henyey%20track">Henyey track</a>.

Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.

Stars spend about 90% of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.
The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion (4.6 × 10) years ago.

Every star generates a <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses 10 every year, or about 0.01% of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10 to 10 each year, significantly affecting their evolution. Stars that begin with more than 50 can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.

The time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun is expected to live 10 billion (10) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 , called <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1 can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion (10) years; the most extreme of 0.08 ) will last for about 12 trillion years. Red dwarfs become <a href="blue%20dwarf%20%28red-dwarf%20stage%29">hotter and more luminous</a> as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature. However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a> (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 are expected to have moved off the main sequence.

Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. Astronomers label all elements heavier than helium "metals", and call the chemical <a href="concentration">concentration</a> of these elements in a star, its <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. A star's metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind. Older, <a href="stellar%20population">population II</a> stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time, such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their <a href="stellar%20atmosphere">atmospheres</a>.

As stars of at least 0.4 exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core. Their outer layers expand and cool greatly as they form a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>. In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters the helium burning phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly , 250 times its present size, and lose 30% of its current mass.

As the hydrogen shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant of up to 2.25 , the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to <a href="helium%20fusion">helium fusion</a>. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a <a href="helium%20flash">helium flash</a>, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the <a href="horizontal%20branch">horizontal branch</a> of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the <a href="red%20clump">red clump</a>, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.

After the star has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses producing a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a> (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.

During their helium-burning phase, a star of more than 9 solar masses expands to form first a <a href="blue%20supergiant">blue</a> and then a <a href="red%20supergiant">red supergiant</a>. Particularly massive stars may evolve to a <a href="Wolf-Rayet%20star">Wolf-Rayet star</a>, characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss.

When helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse <a href="carbon">carbon</a> (see <a href="Carbon-burning%20process">Carbon-burning process</a>). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by <a href="neon">neon</a> (see <a href="neon-burning%20process">neon-burning process</a>), <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (see <a href="oxygen-burning%20process">oxygen-burning process</a>), and <a href="silicon">silicon</a> (see <a href="silicon-burning%20process">silicon-burning process</a>). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.

The final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing <a href="iron">iron</a>. Since iron nuclei are more <a href="binding%20energy">tightly bound</a> than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by <a href="Nuclear%20fission">fission</a>.

As a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such <a href="radiation%20pressure">radiation pressure</a> on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The <a href="electron-degenerate%20matter">electron-degenerate matter</a> inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into <a href="black%20dwarf">black dwarf</a>s over a very long period of time.

In massive stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 ) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> and <a href="inverse%20beta%20decay">inverse beta decay</a>. The <a href="shock%20wave">shockwave</a> formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as "new stars" where none seemingly existed before.

A supernova explosion blows away the star's outer layers, leaving a <a href="supernova%20remnant">remnant</a> such as the Crab Nebula. The core is compressed into a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>, which sometimes manifests itself as a <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a> or <a href="X-ray%20burster">X-ray burster</a>. In the case of the largest stars, the remnant is a black hole greater than 4 . In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as <a href="neutron-degenerate%20matter">neutron-degenerate matter</a>, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, <a href="QCD%20matter">QCD matter</a>, possibly present in the core. Within a black hole, the matter is in a state that is not currently understood.

The blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.

The post–main-sequence evolution of binary stars may be significantly different from the evolution of single stars of the same mass. If stars in a binary system are sufficiently close, when one of the stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its <a href="Roche%20lobe">Roche lobe</a>, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star, leading to transfer of material to the other. When the Roche lobe is violated, a variety of phenomena can result, including <a href="contact%20binaries">contact binaries</a>, <a href="common%20envelope">common-envelope</a> binaries, <a href="Cataclysmic%20variable%20star">cataclysmic variables</a>, and <a href="type%20Ia%20supernova">type Ia supernova</a>e.

Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe, but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100 billion (10) galaxies in the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a>. In 2010, one estimate of the number of stars in the observable universe was 300 <a href="sextillion">sextillion</a> (). While it is often believed that stars only exist within galaxies, intergalactic stars have been discovered.

A <a href="Star%20system">multi-star system</a> consists of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose <a href="Stellar%20kinematics">stellar associations</a> with only a few stars, up to enormous <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.

It has been a long-held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.
The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. This is typical of stellar separations in <a href="disc%20%28galaxy%29">galactic discs</a>. Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s, or much farther apart in <a href="galactic%20spheroid">galactic halos</a>.

Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a>s. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.

Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including such characteristics as luminosity, size, evolution, lifespan, and its eventual fate.

Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>. The oldest star yet discovered, <a href="HD%20140283">HD 140283</a>, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the Universe, determined by the <a href="Planck%20%28spacecraft%29">Planck satellite</a> as 13.799 ± 0.021).

The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.

When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.

The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun. By contrast, the super-metal-rich star <a href="Mu%20Leonis">μ Leonis</a> has nearly double the abundance of iron as the Sun, while the planet-bearing star <a href="14%20Herculis">14 Herculis</a> has nearly triple the iron. There also exist chemically <a href="peculiar%20star">peculiar star</a>s that show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum; especially <a href="chromium">chromium</a> and <a href="rare%20earth%20element">rare earth element</a>s. Stars with cooler outer atmospheres, including the Sun, can form various diatomic and polyatomic molecules.

Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a> that <a href="Twinkling">twinkle</a> because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is <a href="R%20Doradus">R Doradus</a>, with an <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a> of only 0.057 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s.

The disks of most stars are much too small in <a href="Angular%20diameter">angular size</a> to be observed with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so <a href="Interferometry">interferometer</a> telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through <a href="occultation">occultation</a>. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.

Stars range in size from <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s, which vary anywhere from 20 to in diameter, to <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a>s like <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> in the <a href="Orion%20constellation">Orion constellation</a>, which has a diameter about 1,000 times that of our sun. Betelgeuse, however, has a much lower <a href="density">density</a> than the Sun.

The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>.

Radial velocity is measured by the <a href="doppler%20shift">doppler shift</a> of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/<a href="second">s</a>. The proper motion of a star, its <a href="parallax">parallax</a>, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-<a href="arc%20second">arc second</a>s (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.

When both rates of movement are known, the <a href="space%20velocity%20%28astronomy%29">space velocity</a> of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as <a href="stellar%20association">stellar association</a>s.

The <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> of a star is generated within regions of the interior where <a href="convection">convective</a> circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a <a href="dynamo%20theory">dynamo</a>, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce magnetic fields, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces <a href="starspot">starspot</a>s, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. <a href="Coronal%20loop">Coronal loop</a>s are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. <a href="Stellar%20flare">Stellar flare</a>s are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.

Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star's stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time. During
the <a href="Maunder%20Minimum">Maunder Minimum</a>, for example, the Sun underwent a
70-year period with almost no sunspot activity.

One of the most massive stars known is <a href="Eta%20Carinae">Eta Carinae</a>, which,
with 100–150 times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million years. Studies of the most massive <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s suggests as an upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe. This
represents an empirical value for the theoretical limit on the mass of forming stars due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud. Several stars in the <a href="R136">R136</a> cluster in the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> have been measured with larger masses, but
it has been determined that they could have been created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, sidestepping the 150 limit on massive star formation.
The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 , due
to the complete absence of elements heavier than <a href="lithium">lithium</a> in their composition. This generation of supermassive <a href="population%20III%20stars">population III stars</a> is likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., they are observed to have a high redshift), and may have started the production of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s heavier than <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> that are needed for the later formation of <a href="planet">planet</a>s and <a href="life">life</a>. In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for <a href="Population%20III%20stars">Population III stars</a> in the <a href="Cosmos%20Redshift%207">Cosmos Redshift 7</a> galaxy at .

With a mass only 80 times that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> (), <a href="2MASS%20J0523-1403">2MASS J0523-1403</a> is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. For
stars with metallicity similar to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 . When the metallicity is very low, however, the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 . Smaller bodies called <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s, occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s.

The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s.

The rotation rate of stars can be determined through <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic measurement</a>, or more exactly determined by tracking their <a href="starspot">starspot</a>s. Young stars can have a rotation greater than 100 km/s at the equator. The B-class star <a href="Achernar">Achernar</a>, for example, has an equatorial velocity of about 225 km/s or greater, causing its <a href="equatorial%20bulge">equator to bulge outward</a> and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than 50% greater than between the poles. This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km/s at which speed the star would break apart. By contrast, the Sun rotates once every 25–35 days depending on latitude, with an equatorial velocity of 1.93 km/s. A <a href="main%20sequence%20star">main sequence star</a>'s magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow its rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.

<a href="Degenerate%20star">Degenerate star</a>s have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar at the heart of the <a href="Crab%20nebula">Crab nebula</a>, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.

The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production of its core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star's <a href="color%20index">color index</a>. The temperature is normally given in terms of an <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a>, which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. Note that the effective temperature is only a representative of the surface, as the temperature increases toward the core. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s.

The stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> and absorption features, is used to classify a star (see classification below).

Massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000 K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600 K; but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.

The energy produced by stars, a product of nuclear fusion, radiates to space as both <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> and <a href="particle%20radiation">particle radiation</a>. The particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind, which
streams from the outer layers as electrically charged <a href="proton">proton</a>s and <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha</a> and <a href="beta%20particle">beta particle</a>s. Although almost massless, there also exists a steady stream of <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s emanating from the star's core.

The production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> of a new heavier element, <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> <a href="photon">photon</a>s are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of <a href="electromagnetic%20energy">electromagnetic energy</a> of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.

The color of a star, as determined by the most intense <a href="frequency">frequency</a> of the visible light, depends on the temperature of the star's outer layers, including its <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a>. Besides
visible light, stars also emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the <a href="human%20eye">human eye</a>. In fact, stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>, from the longest <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s of <a href="radio%20frequency">radio waves</a> through <a href="infrared">infrared</a>, visible light, <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, to the shortest of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s, and <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s. From the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star, not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant, but all frequencies provide insight into the star's physics.

Using the <a href="astronomical%20spectroscopy">stellar spectrum</a>, astronomers can also determine the surface temperature, <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a>, metallicity and <a href="rotation">rotation</a>al velocity of a star. If the distance of the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in <a href="Binary%20star">binary systems</a> by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. <a href="Gravitational%20microlensing">Gravitational microlensing</a> has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.

The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of <a href="radiant%20energy">radiant energy</a> it radiates per unit of time. It has units of <a href="power%20%28physics%29">power</a>. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star <a href="Vega">Vega</a>, for example, has a higher <a href="energy%20flux">energy flux</a> (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.

Patches of the star's surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as <a href="sunspot">starspots</a>. Small, "dwarf" stars such as our Sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. "Giant" stars have much larger, more obvious starspots, and
they also exhibit strong stellar <a href="limb%20darkening">limb darkening</a>. That is, the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk. Red
dwarf <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a>s such as <a href="UV%20Ceti">UV Ceti</a> may also possess prominent starspot features.

The apparent <a href="brightness">brightness</a> of a star is expressed in terms of its <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>. It is a function of the star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, the <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">extinction</a> effect of <a href="interstellar%20dust">interstellar dust</a> and gas, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).

Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are <a href="logarithmic%20units">logarithmic units</a>: one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the <a href="nth%20root">5th root</a> of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a <a href="first%20magnitude%20star">first magnitude star</a> (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a <a href="second%20magnitude%20star">second magnitude</a> (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a <a href="sixth%20magnitude%20star">sixth magnitude star</a> (+6.00). The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.

On both apparent and absolute magnitude scales, the smaller the magnitude number, the brighter the star; the larger the magnitude number, the fainter the star. The brightest stars, on either scale, have negative magnitude numbers. The variation in brightness (Δ"L") between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star ("m") from the magnitude number of the fainter star ("m"), then using the difference as an exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say:

Relative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude ("M") and apparent magnitude ("m") are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, but it has an absolute magnitude of +1.41.

The Sun has an apparent magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a> as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.

As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is <a href="LBV%201806-20">LBV 1806-20</a>, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the <a href="NGC%206397">NGC 6397</a> cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.

The current stellar classification system originated in the early 20th century, when stars were classified from "A" to "Q" based on the strength of the <a href="hydrogen%20line">hydrogen line</a>. It was thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Instead, it was more complicated: it strengthened with increasing temperature, peaked near 9000 K, and then declined at greater temperatures. The classifications were since reordered by temperature, on which the modern scheme is based.

Stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra, ranging from type "O", which are very hot, to "M", which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: "O, B, A, F, G, K", and "M". A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types "L" and "T", which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes "O0" and "O1" may not exist.

In addition, stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from "0" (<a href="hypergiant">hypergiant</a>s) through "III" (<a href="giant%20star">giants</a>) to "V" (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add "VII" (white dwarfs). <a href="Main%20sequence">Main sequence</a> stars fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence "G2V" yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.

Additional nomenclature, in the form of lower-case letters added to the end of the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum. For example, an ""e"" can indicate the presence of emission lines; ""m"" represents unusually strong levels of metals, and ""var"" can mean variations in the spectral type.

White dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter "D". This is further sub-divided into the classes "DA", "DB", "DC", "DO", "DZ", and "DQ", depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature.

Variable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.

During their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars</a>, and long-period variables such as <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira</a>.

Eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a>s, as well as giant and supergiant stars.

Cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties. This group includes <a href="nova">nova</a>e and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.

Stars can also vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.1 to 3.4 over a period of 2.87 days.

The interior of a stable star is in a state of <a href="hydrostatic%20equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure <a href="gradient">gradient</a> within the star. The <a href="pressure%20gradient">pressure gradient</a> is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.

As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the <a href="degenerate%20matter">degenerate</a> helium core.

In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of <a href="thermal%20equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a>. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.

The <a href="radiation%20zone">radiation zone</a> is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a <a href="convection%20zone">convection zone</a>. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high <a href="opacity%20%28optics%29">opacity</a> (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.

The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers. Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core. For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.
The <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a> is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that <a href="sun%20spots">sun spots</a>, regions of lower than average temperature, appear.

Above the level of the photosphere is the <a href="stellar%20atmosphere">stellar atmosphere</a>. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a> region, where <a href="spicule%20%28solar%20physics%29">spicules</a> appear and <a href="solar%20flare">stellar flares</a> begin. Above this is the transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only . Beyond this is the <a href="corona">corona</a>, a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres. The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star. Despite its high temperature, and the corona emits very little light, due to its low gas density. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>.

From the corona, a <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> of plasma particles expands outward from the star, until it interacts with the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>. For the Sun, the influence of its <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the <a href="heliosphere">heliosphere</a>.

A variety of nuclear fusion reactions take place in the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> relationship "E" = "mc".

The hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive, so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40 million kelvin for a massive O-class star.

In the Sun, with a 10-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the <a href="proton%E2%80%93proton%20chain%20reaction">proton–proton chain reaction</a>:

These reactions result in the overall reaction:

where e is a <a href="positron">positron</a>, γ is a gamma ray photon, ν is a <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>, and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively. The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts, which is actually only a tiny amount of energy. However enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly, producing all the energy necessary to sustain the star's radiation output. In comparison, the combustion of two hydrogen gas molecules with one oxygen gas molecule releases only 5.7 eV.
In more massive stars, helium is produced in a cycle of reactions <a href="catalyst">catalyzed</a> by carbon called the <a href="CNO%20cycle">carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle</a>.

In evolved stars with cores at 100 million kelvin and masses between 0.5 and 10 , helium can be transformed into carbon in the <a href="triple-alpha%20process">triple-alpha process</a> that uses the intermediate element <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a>:

For an overall reaction of:

In massive stars, heavier elements can also be burned in a contracting core through the <a href="neon-burning%20process">neon-burning process</a> and <a href="oxygen-burning%20process">oxygen-burning process</a>. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the <a href="silicon-burning%20process">silicon-burning process</a> that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-56, an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.

The example below shows the amount of time required for a star of 20 to consume all of its nuclear fuel. As an O-class main sequence star, it would be 8 times the solar radius and 62,000 times the Sun's luminosity.

StarCraft is a <a href="military%20science%20fiction">military science fiction</a> <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> and released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> computers on March 31, 1998. The game spawned a franchise, and became the first game of the <a href="StarCraft%20%28series%29">"StarCraft" series</a>. A <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a> version was released in 1999, and a <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> adaptation co-developed with <a href="THQ">Mass Media</a> was released on June 13, 2000. Work on the game started shortly after "" was released in 1995. "StarCraft", in its first incarnation, debuted at the 1996 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a>, where it was unfavorably compared to "Warcraft II". As a result, the project was entirely overhauled before being showcased to the public in early 1997, at which time it received a far more positive response. The game's <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> is particularly popular in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, as of 2006, where players and teams participate in , earn <a href="Sport%20sponsorship">sponsorships</a>, and compete in <a href="Tournament">televised tournaments</a>.

Set in a fictitious <a href="timeline">timeline</a> during the Earth's <a href="25th%20century">25th century</a>, the game revolves around three intelligent species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the <a href="Milky%20Way%20galaxy">Milky Way galaxy</a> known as the "Koprulu Sector": the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Terrans">Terrans</a>, humans exiled from Earth, now skilled at adapting to any situation; the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Zerg">Zerg</a>, a race of <a href="wikt%3Ainsectoid">insectoid</a> aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection, obsessed with assimilating other races; and the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Protoss">Protoss</a>, a <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> species with advanced technology and <a href="psionics">psionic abilities</a> attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophy regarding their way of living from the Zerg.

The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique "factions" in real-time strategy gameplay, and for having a compelling story.

"StarCraft" has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels, the <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>, "", and two officially authorized add-ons. A sequel, "", was released in July 2010, while of the original and expansion was released in August 2017. The original game, along with the expansion, was released for free in April 2017.

<a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>'s use of three distinct races in "StarCraft" is widely credited with revolutionizing the <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> genre. All units are unique to their respective races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the <a href="technology%20tree">technology tree</a>, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed.

The psionic and technologically adept <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Protoss">Protoss</a> have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as <a href="energy%20shield">energy shield</a>s and localized <a href="Faster-than-light">warp</a> capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy of the quality of their units over the quantity. The insectoid <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Zerg">Zerg</a> possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Terrans">Terrans</a> provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.

Although each race is unique in its composition, no race has an innate advantage over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.

"StarCraft" features <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> which scales in difficulty, although the player cannot change the difficulty level in the single-player campaigns. Each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy AI modes, scaling through the course of the campaign to the hardest AI modes. In the <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a> provided with the game, a designer has access to four levels of AI difficulties: "easy", "medium", "hard" and "insane", each setting differing in the units and technologies allowed to an AI faction and the extent of the AI's tactical and strategic planning. The single-player campaign consists of thirty missions, split into ten for each race.

Each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works in exactly the same way for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.

Protoss and Zerg building construction is limited to specific locations: Protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called "creep", that is produced by certain structures. Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary base structures possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location. Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed. Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and can eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action if repairs are not performed by a worker unit. The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit to begin the process of transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings' shields (but not their structure) are regenerative. The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself.

Multiplayer on "StarCraft" is powered through Blizzard Entertainment's <a href="Battle.net">Battle.net</a> Internet service. Through this, a maximum of eight players can compete in a variety of game modes, including simply destroying all other players (which may be competitive, as in Ladder play, or non-ranked, as in melee play), to <a href="king%20of%20the%20hill%20%28game%29">king of the hill</a> and <a href="capture%20the%20flag">capture the flag</a> objective-based games. In addition, the game incorporates a variety of specialized scenarios for different types of game, such as simulating a <a href="American%20football">football</a> game, using the Terran hoverbike unit to conduct a bike race, or hosting a Zerg hunting competition. "StarCraft" is also one of the few games that include a <a href="spawn%20installation">spawn installation</a>, which allows for limited multiplayer. It must be installed from a disc, and requires a <a href="product%20key">product key</a> to work just as the full version does. However, one product key can support up to eight spawned installations with access to Battle.net. Limitations of a spawned installation include the inability to play single-player missions, create multiplayer games or use the campaign editor. Newer releases of the game available through Battle.net or discs that include the Windows Vista label don't support the spawn installation.

"StarCraft" takes place in a science fiction universe created by <a href="Chris%20Metzen">Chris Metzen</a> and James Phinney for Blizzard Entertainment. According to the story presented in the game's manual, the overpopulation of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> in the early 24th century has caused the international governing body, known as United Powers League (which was later succeeded by <a href="United%20Earth%20Directorate">United Earth Directorate</a>), to exile certain members of the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Terrans">human</a> race, such as criminals, the <a href="cybernetics">cybernetically enhanced</a> and <a href="mutant%20%28fictional%29">genetic mutants</a> to colonize the far reaches of the galaxy. An attempt to colonize a nearby solar system goes wrong, resulting in humanity's arrival in the Koprulu Sector. In the distant Koprulu Sector of the galaxy, the exiles form several governments, but quickly fall into conflict with each other. One government, the <a href="Confederacy%20of%20Man">Confederacy of Man</a>, eventually emerges as the strongest faction, but its oppressive nature and brutal methods of suppressing dissidents stir up major rebel opposition in the form of a terrorist group called the <a href="Sons%20of%20Korhal">Sons of Korhal</a>. Just prior to the beginning of the game, in December 2499, an alien race possessing advanced technology and psionic power, the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Protoss">Protoss</a>, makes <a href="first%20contact%20%28science%20fiction%29">first contact</a> with humanity by destroying a Confederate colony world without any prior warning. Soon after this, the Terrans discover that a second alien race, the insectoid <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Zerg">Zerg</a>, has been stealthily infesting the surface of several of the Terran colonies, and that the Protoss are destroying the planets to prevent the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy threatened by two alien races and internal rebellion, it begins to crumble.

The player assumes the role of three nameless characters over the course of the game. In the first act, the player acts as the Confederate magistrate of an outlying colony world of Mar Sara, threatened by both the Zerg and the Protoss, and is forced through events to join the rebel Sons of Korhal under its leader <a href="Arcturus%20Mengsk">Arcturus Mengsk</a>. Mengsk's campaign is accompanied by <a href="Jim%20Raynor">Jim Raynor</a>, a <a href="morality">morally conscious</a> law enforcement officer from Mar Sara, and <a href="Sarah%20Kerrigan">Sarah Kerrigan</a>, a <a href="ghost%20agent">psychic assassin</a> and Mengsk's second-in-command. The second episode of the game sees the player as a <a href="Cerebrates">cerebrate</a>, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is ruled over by the <a href="Zerg%20Overmind">Zerg Overmind</a> — the manifestation of the collective consciousness of the Swarm and the game's primary antagonist — and is given advice from other cerebrates of higher rank and status while accomplishing the objectives of the Swarm. In the final part of "StarCraft", the player is a newly appointed <a href="Artanis%20%28StarCraft%29">Executor</a> within the Protoss military reporting to Aldaris, a representative of the <a href="Protoss%20Conclave">Protoss government</a>. Aldaris is at odds with <a href="Tassadar">Tassadar</a> — the former occupant of the player's position — over his association with <a href="Zeratul">Zeratul</a>, a member of a heretical group known as <a href="dark%20templar">dark templar</a>.

The story of "StarCraft" is presented through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, along with the use of cinematic <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and <a href="Jim%20Raynor">Jim Raynor</a> are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara in the wake of the Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the <a href="Terran%20Confederacy">Confederacy</a> arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general <a href="Edmund%20Duke%20%28StarCraft%29">Edmund Duke</a> to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, <a href="Sarah%20Kerrigan">Sarah Kerrigan</a>, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the <a href="Terran%20Dominion">Terran Dominion</a>, crowning himself as emperor.

The second campaign reveals that Kerrigan was not killed by the Zerg, but rather is captured and infested in an effort to incorporate her <a href="psionics">psionic</a> traits into the Zerg <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a>. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander <a href="Tassadar">Tassadar</a> discovers that the Zerg's <a href="Cerebrates">cerebrate</a>s cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical <a href="dark%20templar">dark templar</a>. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate <a href="Zeratul">Zeratul</a>, who assassinates <a href="Cerebrates">Zasz</a>, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the <a href="Zerg%20Overmind">Zerg Overmind</a>, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.

The final episode of the game sees <a href="Characters%20of%20StarCraft%23Aldaris">Aldaris</a> and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later hinted to be <a href="Artanis%20%28StarCraft%29">Artanis</a>) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when they use their energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. Aided by Raynor's forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind's weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind's outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.

<a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> began development on "StarCraft" in 1995, shortly after the release of highly successful "". Using the "Tides of Darkness" game engine as a base, "StarCraft" made its debut at <a href="E3%201996">E3 1996</a>. The version of the game displayed, assembled by the team's lead programmer Bob Fitch, received a rather weak response from the convention and was criticized by many for being ""<a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a>" in space." As a consequence the entire project was overhauled, bringing the focus onto creating three distinct species. <a href="Bill%20Roper%20%28video%20game%20producer%29">Bill Roper</a>, one of the game's producers, stated this would be a major departure from the "Warcraft" approach, comparing its two equal sides to those of chess and stating that "StarCraft" would allow players to "develop very unique strategies based on which species is being played, and will require players to think of different strategies to combat the other two species." The hand-drawn graphics seen in the E3 version were also replaced with rendered graphics. In early 1997, the new version of "StarCraft" was unveiled, receiving a far more positive response.
However, the game was still marred by technical difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the "Warcraft II" engine within two months to ensure that many of the features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to <a href="burrow">burrow</a> and <a href="cloaking%20device">cloak</a>, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> and backgrounds, constructed using <a href="3D%20Studio%20Max">3D Studio Max</a>. An <a href="isometric%20projection">isometric</a> in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to "Warcraft II"s <a href="Auxiliary%20view">3/4s birdseye perspective</a>. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.

Despite the progress, "StarCraft" was slow to emerge. The continual delays inspired a group of "StarCraft" fans on the official forums who labeled themselves "Operation: Can't Wait Any Longer" to write a series of fictional stories in which the members of Operation CWAL attempted to retrieve the <a href="Open%20beta">beta</a> version of "StarCraft" from Blizzard's headquarters in <a href="Irvine%2C%20California">Irvine, California</a>. To pay homage to their presence on the forums and enthusiasm for the game, Blizzard Entertainment later incorporated the group's name into "StarCraft" as a cheat code to speed up the production of units and gave the group thanks in the game's credits. The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> on March 31, 1998, with the <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a> version following a year later in 1999. Development on a <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> version, "StarCraft 64", began in 1999, converted from PC by Mass Media Interactive Entertainment—a subsidiary of <a href="THQ">THQ</a>—and published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. "StarCraft 64" was released on June 13, 2000 in the USA and Europe. It was also released in Australia on May 25, 2001.
The musical score to "StarCraft" was composed by Blizzard Entertainment's composers. Glenn Stafford composed the Terran and Protoss in-game themes, while Derek Duke, who was a contracted composer at the time, wrote all the in-game music for the Zerg. The cinematic scores were composed by Stafford and Hayes. Hayes also collaborated with Stafford on one of the Protoss in-game tracks. Tracy W. Bush provided additional support in composing. The musical score of the game was received well by reviewers, who have described it as "appropriately melodic and dark" and "impressive", with one reviewer noting that some of the music owed much of its inspiration to <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a>'s score for the film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>". The first official game soundtrack, "StarCraft: Game Music Vol. 1", was released in 2000, comprising tracks from both "StarCraft" and "", as well as a sizable portion of remix tracks and music inspired by "StarCraft", created by several <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>n <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a>s. The soundtrack was distributed by Net Vision Entertainment. In September 2008, Blizzard Entertainment announced that a second soundtrack, "StarCraft Original Soundtrack", had been released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>. This soundtrack consisted entirely of the original music from "StarCraft" and "Brood War", both from in-game themes to music used in the cinematic <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s.

Before the release of "StarCraft", Blizzard Entertainment released a free-to-download <a href="game%20demo">game demo</a> entitled "Loomings", comprising three missions and a tutorial. The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on <a href="Battle.net">Battle.net</a>. In addition, the full release of "StarCraft" included a secondary campaign entitled "Enslavers". Consisting of five missions played as both the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Terrans">Terrans</a> and the <a href="Races%20of%20StarCraft%23Protoss">Protoss</a>, "Enslavers" is set in the second campaign in "StarCraft" and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg <a href="Cerebrates">cerebrate</a> and is pursued by both the Protoss and <a href="Ara%20Tribe">Terran Dominion</a>. "Enslavers" acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game's <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a>, highlighting how to use the features of the program.
"StarCraft"s first expansion, Insurrection, was released for Windows on July 31, 1998. The expansion was developed by Aztech New Media and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. Its story focused on a separate Confederate colony alluded to in the manual to "StarCraft", following a group of Terran colonists and a Protoss fleet in their fight against the Zerg and a rising local insurgency. "Insurrection" was not received well, being criticized by reviewers for lacking the quality of the original game. "Insurrection" was followed within a few months by a second expansion, Retribution. Developed by <a href="Stardock">Stardock</a>, published by <a href="WizardWorks">WizardWorks</a> and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment, "Retribution" follows all three races attempting to seize control of a powerful crystal on a Terran Dominion colony. The expansion was not received with critical support, instead being regarded as average but at least challenging. After the release of "Retribution", Blizzard Entertainment announced a new official expansion pack that would continue on the story of "StarCraft". "" was consequently created, developed jointly by Blizzard Entertainment and <a href="Saffire%20Corporation">Saffire Corporation</a>. "Brood War" continues the story of "StarCraft" from days after its conclusion, and was released for both Windows and Mac to critical praise on November 30, 1998 in the US and in March 1999 in Europe.

Before Insurrection, an unauthorized expansion pack, called Stellar Forces, was published by Micro Star but was recalled weeks later when Blizzard won the court case against it. It consisted of 22 single player maps and 32 multi-player maps which are considered to be rather plain.

In 2000, "StarCraft 64" was released In North America for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, co-developed by <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> and <a href="Mass%20Media%20Inc.">Mass Media Inc.</a> and published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. The game featured all of the missions from both "StarCraft" and the expansion "Brood War", as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, "Resurrection IV". Blizzard Entertainment had previously considered a <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> port of the game, but it was decided that the game would instead be released on the Nintendo 64. "Resurrection IV" is set after the conclusion of "Brood War", and follows <a href="Jim%20Raynor">Jim Raynor</a> embarking on a mission to rescue the "Brood War" character <a href="Alexei%20Stukov">Alexei Stukov</a>, a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The "Brood War" missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory <a href="Expansion%20Pak">Expansion Pak</a> to run. In addition, "StarCraft 64" features a <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split screen</a> <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative mode</a>, also requiring the expansion pak, allowing two players to control one force in-game. "StarCraft 64" lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened.

In 1999, NASA astronaut <a href="Daniel%20T.%20Barry">Daniel T. Barry</a> flew a StarCraft game disc into space aboard the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery">Space Shuttle Discovery</a>. The game’s historic voyage took place during <a href="STS-96">STS-96</a>, the first ever mission to dock with the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

"StarCraft" was released internationally on March 31, 1998 and became the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games%23PC">best-selling PC game</a> for that year, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. In the United States, it was best-selling computer game of 1998, with 746,365 units sold. It was the country's 14th best-selling release of the period between 1993 and 1999, selling 916,000 copies. By April 1999, South Korean players had purchased almost 300,000 units of the game. "StarCraft"s worldwide sales reached 4 million units by July 2001; <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> accounted for 50% of these copies. By May 2007, "StarCraft" had sold over 9.5 million copies across the globe, with 4.5 million of these being sold in South Korea. Since the initial release of "StarCraft", <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> reported that its <a href="Battle.net">Battle.net</a> online multiplayer service grew by 800 percent.

Generally, "StarCraft" was received positively by critics, with many contemporary reviewers noting that while the game may not have deviated significantly from the status quo of most real-time strategy games, it was one of the best to have applied the formula. In addition, "StarCraft"s pioneering use of three distinct, unique and balanced races over two equal sides was praised by critics, with <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> commenting that this helped the game to "avoid the problem that has plagued every other game in the genre". Many critics also praised the strength of the story accompanying the game, with some reviewers being impressed by how well the story was folded into the gameplay. The game's voice acting in particular was praised; GameSpot later hailed the voice work in the game as one of the ten best in the industry at the time. Equally, the multiplayer aspects of the game were positively received. "StarCraft" has received multiple awards, including being named as one of the best games of all time by GameSpot, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>". According to Blizzard Entertainment "StarCraft" has won 37 awards, and has received a star on the floor of the <a href="Metreon">Metreon</a> as part of the <a href="Walk%20of%20Game">Walk of Game</a> in San Francisco in early 2006.

Although at the time "StarCraft"s graphics and audio were praised by critics, later reviews have noted that the graphics do not compare to more modern games. The capacity for the game's <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> to navigate units to waypoints also faced some heavy criticism, with "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" stating that the inability for developers to make an effective pathfinding system was "the single most infuriating element of the real-time strategy genre". In addition, several reviewers expressed concern over some familiarities between the unit structures of each race, as well as over the potential imbalance of players using <a href="rush%20%28video%20gaming%29">rushing tactics</a> early in multiplayer games. Blizzard Entertainment has strived to balance rush tactics in later updates. The Nintendo 64 version of the game was not received as positively by reviewers, and was criticized for poor graphics in comparison to the PC version. However, critics did praise the game and <a href="THQ">Mass Media</a> for using effective controls on the gamepad and maintaining the high quality audio.

"Starcraft" won the <a href="Origins%20Award">Origins Award</a>s for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1998.

In 1998, "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" declared it the 5th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it "a strategy game that continues to evolve and surprise many months after its release, and that currently represents the state of the genre's art".

GameSpot described "StarCraft" as "The defining game of its genre. It is the standard by which all real-time strategy games are judged." <a href="IGN">IGN</a> stated that "StarCraft" "is hands down one of the best, if not the best, real-time strategy games ever created." "StarCraft" is frequently included in the industry's best games rankings, for example it ranked 37 in <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">"Edge"s</a> top 100 games of all time. "StarCraft" has even been taken into space, as <a href="Daniel%20T.%20Barry">Daniel Barry</a> took a copy of the game with him on the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle</a> mission <a href="STS-96">STS-96</a> in 1999. "StarCraft"s popularity resulted in "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" awarding the game four world records, including "Best Selling PC Strategy Game," "Largest Income in Professional Gaming," and "Largest Audience for a Game Competition" when 120,000 fans turned out to watch the final of the SKY proleague season 2005 in <a href="Busan%2C%20South%20Korea">Busan, South Korea</a>. Researchers have shown that the audience for watching "StarCraft" games is diverse and that "StarCraft" uses instances of <a href="information%20asymmetry">information asymmetry</a> to make the game more entertaining for spectators. In addition, "StarCraft" has been the subject of an academic course; the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> offered a student-run introductory course on theory and strategy in spring 2009.

After its release, "StarCraft" rapidly grew in popularity in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, eventually making its way to become the country's national e-sport after establishing a successful pro-gaming scene. Professional gamers in South Korea are media celebrities, and "StarCraft" games are broadcast over three television channels dedicated to the professional gaming scene. Professional gamers in South Korea have gained television contracts, sponsorships, and tournament prizes, allowing one of the most famous players, <a href="Lim%20%26quot%3BBoxeR%26quot%3B%20Yo-hwan">Lim "BoxeR" Yo-hwan</a>, to gain a fan club of over half a million people. One player, <a href="Lee%20Yun-yeol">Lee Yun-yeol</a>, reported earnings in 2005 of .

"StarCraft" was part of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>'s <a href="Air%20and%20Space%20Basic%20Course">Air and Space Basic Course</a>, used to teach newly active officers about crisis planning under stress and joint service teamwork. Other efforts to make more 'realistic' current-day battle software led to distractions when simulated hardware didn't align with the real hardware active duty officers knew about. The science fiction setting allowed students to focus on the battle tactics.

The annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment hosts a competition for AIs playing the game. As of 2015, humans still win.

In 2014, an unofficial version for the <a href="Pandora%20%28console%29">Pandora</a> handheld and the <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM architecture</a> became available by <a href="static%20recompilation">static recompilation</a> and <a href="reverse%20engineering">reverse engineering</a> of the original <a href="x86">x86</a> version.

The storyline of "StarCraft" has been adapted into several novels. The first novel, "Uprising", which was written by Blizzard employee Micky Neilson and published in December 2000, acts as a prequel to the events of "StarCraft". Other novels—"Liberty's Crusade" by <a href="Jeff%20Grubb">Jeff Grubb</a> and <a href="Aaron%20S.%20Rosenberg">Aaron Rosenberg's</a> "Queen of Blades"—retell the story of the game from different perspectives. At <a href="BlizzCon">BlizzCon</a> 2007, "StarCraft" creator Chris Metzen stated that he hoped to novelize the entirety of "StarCraft" and its expansion "Brood War" into a definitive text-based story. Later novels, such as <a href="Gabriel%20Mesta">Gabriel Mesta</a>'s "Shadow of the Xel'Naga" and <a href="Christie%20Golden">Christie Golden</a>'s "The Dark Templar Saga", further expand the storyline, creating the setting for "".

Solar System

The Solar System is the <a href="gravity">gravitationally</a> bound <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the <a href="List%20of%20gravitationally%20rounded%20objects%20of%20the%20Solar%20System%23Planets">eight planets</a>, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the <a href="List%20of%20gravitationally%20rounded%20objects%20of%20the%20Solar%20System%23Dwarf%20planets">five dwarf planets</a> and <a href="small%20Solar%20System%20bodies">small Solar System bodies</a>. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the <a href="Natural%20satellite">moons</a>—two are larger than the smallest planet, <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>.

The Solar System <a href="Formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">formed 4.6 billion years ago</a> from the <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> of a giant interstellar <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>. The vast majority of the system's <a href="mass">mass</a> is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, <a href="Venus">Venus</a>, <a href="Earth">Earth</a> and <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, are <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, are <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s, being composed mainly of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium">helium</a>; the two outermost planets, <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>, are <a href="ice%20giant">ice giant</a>s, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called <a href="volatiles">volatiles</a>, such as water, <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> and <a href="methane">methane</a>. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>.

The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> and <a href="scattered%20disc">scattered disc</a>, which are populations of <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a>s composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of <a href="sednoid">sednoid</a>s. Within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are categorized as <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>s. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a> and the trans-Neptunian objects <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> and <a href="Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Eris</a>. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including <a href="comet">comet</a>s, <a href="Centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">centaurs</a> and <a href="interplanetary%20dust%20cloud">interplanetary dust cloud</a>s, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by <a href="natural%20satellite">natural satellite</a>s, usually termed "moons" after the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Each of the outer planets is encircled by <a href="planetary%20ring">planetary ring</a>s of dust and other small objects.

The <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a>, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> known as the <a href="heliosphere">heliosphere</a>. The <a href="Heliopause%20%28astronomy%29">heliopause</a> is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>; it extends out to the edge of the <a href="scattered%20disc">scattered disc</a>. The <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>, which is thought to be the source for <a href="long-period%20comet">long-period comet</a>s, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the <a href="Orion%20Arm">Orion Arm</a>, 26,000 light-years from the center of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy.

For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>–<a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the <a href="universe">universe</a> and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> philosopher <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samos">Aristarchus of Samos</a> had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> was the first to develop a mathematically predictive <a href="heliocentric">heliocentric</a> system.

In the 17th century, <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it. <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a> and the shape of the <a href="rings%20of%20Saturn">rings of Saturn</a>. <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">a comet</a> were recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75–76 years. This was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun. Around this time (1704), the term "Solar System" first appeared in English. In 1838, <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a> successfully measured a <a href="stellar%20parallax">stellar parallax</a>, an apparent shift in the position of a star created by Earth's motion around the Sun, providing the first direct, experimental proof of heliocentrism. Improvements in observational astronomy and the use of <a href="unmanned%20spacecraft">unmanned spacecraft</a> have since enabled the detailed investigation of other bodies orbiting the Sun.

The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">G2 main-sequence star</a> that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s, the <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>s, <a href="List%20of%20moons">moons</a>, <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s, and <a href="comet">comet</a>s) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.

Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>. The planets are very close to the ecliptic, whereas comets and <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are <a href="retrograde%20motion">exceptions</a>, such as <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>.

The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.

Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called <a href="natural%20satellite">natural satellite</a>s, or moons (two of which, <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a> and <a href="Ganymede%20%28moon%29">Ganymede</a>, are larger than the planet <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>), and, in the case of the four giant planets, by <a href="planetary%20ring">planetary ring</a>s, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in <a href="synchronous%20rotation">synchronous rotation</a>, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.

<a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a> describe the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a> with the Sun at one <a href="focus%20%28geometry%29">focus</a>. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major axes</a>) travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its "<a href="perihelion">perihelion</a>", whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its "<a href="aphelion">aphelion</a>". The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using <a href="numerical%20model%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">numerical models</a>.

Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.

The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, which comprise nearly all the remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and <a href="light%20pressure">light pressure</a> from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as the <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.

The objects of the inner Solar System are composed mostly of rock, the collective name for compounds with high melting points, such as <a href="silicates">silicates</a>, iron or nickel, that remained solid under almost all conditions in the <a href="protoplanetary%20nebula">protoplanetary nebula</a>. Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high <a href="vapour%20pressure">vapour pressure</a>, such as <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="helium">helium</a>, and <a href="neon">neon</a>, which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula. Ices, like <a href="water">water</a>, <a href="methane">methane</a>, <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a>, and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, have melting points up to a few hundred kelvins. They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase. Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the so-called "<a href="ice%20giant">ice giant</a>s") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Together, gases and ices are referred to as "<a href="volatiles">volatiles</a>".

The distance from Earth to the Sun is . For comparison, the radius of the Sun is . Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is from the Sun and has a radius of , whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is from the Sun.

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the <a href="Titius%E2%80%93Bode%20law">Titius–Bode law</a>), but no such theory has been accepted. The images at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.

Some <a href="Solar%20System%20model">Solar System model</a>s attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called <a href="Orrery">orreries</a>)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such scale model, the <a href="Sweden%20Solar%20System">Sweden Solar System</a>, uses the 110-metre (361 ft) <a href="Ericsson%20Globe">Ericsson Globe</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at <a href="Arlanda%20International%20Airport">Arlanda International Airport</a>, 40 km (25 mi) away, whereas the farthest current object, <a href="90377%20Sedna">Sedna</a>, is a 10 cm (4 in) sphere in <a href="Lule%C3%A5">Luleå</a>, 912 km (567 mi) away.

If the Sun–Neptune distance is <a href="Solar%20System%20model">scaled</a> to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about 3 cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm, and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3 mm) at this scale.

The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the <a href="solar%20nebula">pre-solar nebula</a>, collapsed, <a href="conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum">conservation of angular momentum</a> caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a <a href="protoplanetary%20disc">protoplanetary disc</a> with a diameter of roughly 200 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> and a hot, dense <a href="protostar">protostar</a> at the centre. The planets formed by <a href="accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accretion</a> from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover <a href="small%20Solar%20System%20body">minor bodies</a>.

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a>, and <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>. The <a href="Nice%20model">Nice model</a> is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin <a href="nuclear%20fusion">thermonuclear fusion</a>. The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until <a href="hydrostatic%20equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a> was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-<a href="stellar%20remnant">remnant</a> life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the <a href="heliosphere">heliosphere</a> and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.

The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with <a href="metallicity">heavier elements</a> like carbon—to the interstellar medium.

The Sun is the Solar System's <a href="star">star</a> and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its <a href="solar%20core">core</a> high enough to sustain <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> into <a href="helium">helium</a>, making it a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star. This releases an enormous amount of <a href="energy">energy</a>, mostly <a href="radiant%20energy">radiated</a> into <a href="outer%20space">space</a> as <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> peaking in <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>.

The Sun is a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">G2-type main-sequence star</a>. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the <a href="O-type%20main-sequence%20star">hottest stars</a> and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.

The Sun is a <a href="Population%20I%20stars">population I star</a>; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("<a href="metallicity">metals</a>" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".

The vast majority of the Solar System consists of a near-<a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> known as the <a href="interplanetary%20medium">interplanetary medium</a>. Along with <a href="Sunlight">light</a>, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>) known as the <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a>. This stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour, creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100 AU "(see )". Activity on the Sun's surface, such as <a href="solar%20flare">solar flare</a>s and <a href="coronal%20mass%20ejection">coronal mass ejection</a>s, disturbs the heliosphere, creating <a href="space%20weather">space weather</a> and causing <a href="geomagnetic%20storm">geomagnetic storm</a>s. The largest structure within the heliosphere is the <a href="heliospheric%20current%20sheet">heliospheric current sheet</a>, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.

<a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a> stops <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">its atmosphere</a> from being stripped away by the solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and as a result the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. <a href="Coronal%20mass%20ejection">Coronal mass ejection</a>s and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create <a href="Aurora%20%28astronomy%29">aurorae</a> seen near the <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field%23Magnetic%20poles">magnetic poles</a>.

The heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. The density of cosmic rays in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.

The interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of <a href="cosmic%20dust">cosmic dust</a>. The first, the <a href="interplanetary%20dust%20cloud">zodiacal dust cloud</a>, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the <a href="zodiacal%20light">zodiacal light</a>. It was likely formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10 AU to about 40 AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a>.

The inner Solar System is the region comprising the <a href="%23Terrestrial%20planets">terrestrial planets</a> and the <a href="%23Asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>. Composed mainly of <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, which is a little less than 5 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> (about 700 million km) from the Sun.

The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no <a href="natural%20satellite">moons</a>, and no <a href="planetary%20ring">ring systems</a>. They are composed largely of <a href="Refractory%20%28planetary%20science%29">refractory</a> minerals, such as the silicateswhich form their <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">crusts</a> and <a href="mantle%20%28geology%29">mantles</a>and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their <a href="planetary%20core">cores</a>. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a>s substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and <a href="tectonics">tectonic</a> surface features, such as <a href="rift%20valley">rift valley</a>s and volcanoes. The term "inner planet" should not be confused with "<a href="inferior%20planet">inferior planet</a>", which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

<a href="Asteroid">Asteroid</a>s except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as <a href="small%20Solar%20System%20bodies">small Solar System bodies</a> and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice. They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>s and <a href="micrometeoroids">micrometeoroids</a> (grain-sized), depending on different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.

The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between from the Sun. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.

The outer region of the Solar System is home to the <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s and their large moons. The <a href="Centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">centaurs</a> and many <a href="short-period%20comet">short-period comet</a>s also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.

The four outer planets, or giant planets (sometimes called Jovian planets), collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the <a href="Earth%20mass">mass of Earth</a> and consist overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune are far less massiveless than 20 Earth masses () eachand are composed primarily of ices. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category, <a href="ice%20giants">ice giants</a>. All four giant planets have <a href="Planetary%20ring">rings</a>, although only Saturn's ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term "<a href="superior%20planet">superior planet</a>" designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and Mars.

The centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes greater than Jupiter's (5.5 AU) and less than Neptune's (30 AU). The largest known centaur, <a href="10199%20Chariklo">10199 Chariklo</a>, has a diameter of about 250 km. The first centaur discovered, <a href="2060%20Chiron">2060 Chiron</a>, has also been classified as comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the Sun.

Comets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to <a href="sublimation%20%28chemistry%29">sublimate</a> and <a href="ion">ion</a>ise, creating a <a href="coma%20%28cometary%29">coma</a>: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.

Short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as <a href="Comet%20Hale%E2%80%93Bopp">Hale–Bopp</a>, are thought to originate in the <a href="%23Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>. Many comet groups, such as the <a href="Kreutz%20Sungrazers">Kreutz Sungrazers</a>, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with <a href="hyperbolic%20trajectory">hyperbolic</a> orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.

Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the "<a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian region</a>", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is <a href="Orbital%20inclination">tilted toward the plane</a> of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt. The entire region is still <a href="Timeline%20of%20Solar%20System%20exploration">largely unexplored</a>. It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice. This region is sometimes described as the "third zone of the Solar System", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System.

The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as <a href="50000%20Quaoar">Quaoar</a>, <a href="20000%20Varuna">Varuna</a>, and <a href="90482%20Orcus">Orcus</a>, may prove to be dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50 km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.

The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the "<a href="Classical%20Kuiper%20belt%20object">classical</a>" belt and the <a href="Resonant%20trans-Neptunian%20object">resonances</a>. Resonances are orbits linked to that of Neptune (e.g. twice for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two). The first resonance begins within the orbit of Neptune itself. The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4 AU to 47.7 AU. Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as <a href="Classical%20Kuiper%20belt%20object">cubewanos</a>, after the first of their kind to be discovered, <a href="15760%20Albion">15760 Albion</a> (which previously had the provisional designation 1992 QB), and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.

The scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of <a href="Formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System%23Planetary%20migration">Neptune's early outward migration</a>. Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150 AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as "scattered Kuiper belt objects". Some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.

The point at which the Solar System ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this "heliopause", the outer boundary of the <a href="%23Heliosphere">heliosphere</a>, is considered the beginning of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>. The Sun's <a href="Hill%20sphere">Hill sphere</a>, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized <a href="%23Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>.

The heliosphere is a <a href="stellar-wind%20bubble">stellar-wind bubble</a>, a region of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400 km/s its <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a>, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>.

The collision occurs at the "termination shock", which is roughly 80–100 AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the "heliosheath". This structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40 AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from "<a href="Cassini%20%28spacecraft%29">Cassini</a>" and <a href="Interstellar%20Boundary%20Explorer">Interstellar Boundary Explorer</a> spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.

The outer boundary of the heliosphere, the "heliopause", is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. <a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a> and <a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a> are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84 AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.

The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as <a href="solar%20magnetic%20field">solar magnetic field</a>s prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9 AU farther than the southern hemisphere. Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the <a href="bow%20shock">bow shock</a>, a plasma "wake" left by the Sun as it travels through the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.
Due to a lack of data, conditions in local interstellar space are not known for certain. It is expected that <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Voyager%20program">Voyager spacecraft</a>, as they pass the heliopause, will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to Earth. How well the heliosphere shields the Solar System from cosmic rays is poorly understood. A NASA-funded team has developed a concept of a "Vision Mission" dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere.

<a href="90377%20Sedna">90377 Sedna</a> (520 AU average) is a large, reddish object with a gigantic, highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76 AU at perihelion to 940 AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. <a href="Michael%20E.%20Brown">Mike Brown</a>, who discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the <a href="scattered%20disc">scattered disc</a> or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed "distant detached objects" (DDOs), which also may include the object , which has a perihelion of 45 AU, an aphelion of 415 AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years. Brown terms this population the "inner Oort cloud" because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun. Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined. The second unequivocally detached object, with a perihelion farther than Sedna's at roughly 81 AU, is , discovered in 2012. Its aphelion is only half that of Sedna's, at 400–500 AU.

The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000 AU (around 1 <a href="light-year">light-year</a> (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000 AU (1.87 ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the <a href="galactic%20tide">galactic tide</a>, the <a href="tidal%20force">tidal force</a> exerted by the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

Much of the Solar System is still unknown. The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">surrounding stars</a> out to about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU. Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area tens of thousands of AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun. Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.

Currently, the furthest known objects, such as <a href="Comet%20West">Comet West</a>, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun, but as the Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.

The Solar System is located in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, a <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with a diameter of about 100,000 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the <a href="Orion%E2%80%93Cygnus%20Arm">Orion–Cygnus Arm</a> or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the <a href="Galactic%20Centre">Galactic Centre</a>, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220 km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's <a href="galactic%20year">galactic year</a>. The <a href="solar%20apex">solar apex</a>, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a> in the direction of the current location of the bright star <a href="Vega">Vega</a>. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a>.

The Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the <a href="evolutionary%20history%20of%20life">evolutionary history of life</a> on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the <a href="%23Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a> and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.

The Solar System is in the <a href="Local%20Interstellar%20Cloud">Local Interstellar Cloud</a> or Local Fluff. It is thought to be near the neighbouring <a href="G-Cloud">G-Cloud</a> but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the <a href="Local%20Bubble">Local Bubble</a>, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.

There are relatively few <a href="list%20of%20nearest%20stars">stars within ten light-years of the Sun</a>. The closest is the triple star system <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>, which is about 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>, <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a> was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called <a href="Proxima%20Centauri%20b">Proxima Centauri b</a>, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun. The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs <a href="Barnard%27s%20Star">Barnard's Star</a> (at 5.9 ly), <a href="Wolf%20359">Wolf 359</a> (7.8 ly), and <a href="Lalande%2021185">Lalande 21185</a> (8.3 ly).

The largest nearby star is <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, a bright <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star roughly 8.6 light-years away and roughly twice the Sun's mass and that is orbited by a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>, Sirius B. The nearest <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s are the binary <a href="Luhman%2016">Luhman 16</a> system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system <a href="Luyten%20726-8">Luyten 726-8</a> (8.7 ly) and the solitary red dwarf <a href="Ross%20154">Ross 154</a> (9.7 ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is <a href="Tau%20Ceti">Tau Ceti</a> at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity. The closest known <a href="rogue%20planet">free-floating planetary-mass object</a> to the Sun is <a href="WISE%200855%E2%88%920714">WISE 0855−0714</a>, an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away.
Compared to many other <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>s, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury. The known Solar System also lacks <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a>s (<a href="Planet%20Nine">Planet Nine</a> could be a super-Earth beyond the known Solar System). Uncommonly, it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants; elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typical—both rocky and gas—so there is no "gap" as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune (with a radius 3.8 times as large). Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury. This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.

The orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a>. Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.

This section is a sampling of Solar System bodies, selected for size and quality of imagery, and sorted by volume. Some omitted objects are larger than the ones included here, notably <a href="Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Eris</a>, because these have not been imaged in high quality.

Star Trek: First Contact

Star Trek: First Contact is a 1996 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="Jonathan%20Frakes">Jonathan Frakes</a> (in his cinematic <a href="List%20of%20directorial%20debuts">directorial debut</a>), and based on the <a href="Star%20Trek">franchise of the same name</a> created by <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>. It is the eighth film in the <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">"Star Trek" film series</a>, as well as the second to star the cast of the series "". In the film, the crew of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-E%29">USS "Enterprise"-E</a> travel back in time from the 24th century to the mid 21st-century in order to stop the <a href="cyborg">cybernetic</a> <a href="Borg%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Borg</a> from conquering Earth by changing their past.

After the release of the seventh film, "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Generations">Star Trek Generations</a>" (1994), <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> tasked writers <a href="Brannon%20Braga">Brannon Braga</a> and <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> with developing the next film in the series. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a> wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period that the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century, after fearing the Renaissance idea would be "too <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>". After two better-known directors turned down the job, cast member <a href="Jonathan%20Frakes">Jonathan Frakes</a> was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood "Star Trek". The film's script required the creation of new starship designs, including <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20Starfleet%20starships%20ordered%20by%20class%23Sovereign%20class">a new USS "Enterprise"</a>. Production designer <a href="Herman%20Zimmerman">Herman Zimmerman</a> and illustrator <a href="John%20Eaves">John Eaves</a> collaborated to make a sleeker ship than <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">its predecessor</a>. Principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California, before production moved to new sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as their appearances on the television series. Effects company <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> rushed to complete the film's special effects in less than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a>. <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> and his son <a href="Joel%20Goldsmith">Joel Goldsmith</a> collaborated to produce the film's score.

"First Contact" was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. It eventually made $92 million in the United States and Canada with an additional $54 million in other territories, combining a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> considered it to be one of the best "Star Trek" films, and was the most positively reviewed film in the <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">franchise</a> (93% of reviews were positive) until being marginally surpassed (94%) by the 2009 <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">reboot film</a>. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a>'s parallels to <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s <a href="Ahab%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Ahab</a> and the nature of the Borg. "First Contact" was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Makeup%20and%20Hairstyling">Academy Award for Best Makeup</a> and won three <a href="Saturn%20Awards">Saturn Awards</a>.

It is the 24th century. Captain <a href="Jean%20Luc%20Picard">Jean Luc Picard</a> awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic <a href="Borg">Borg</a> . He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg threat against <a href="Earth%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Earth</a>. Picard's orders are for his ship, , to patrol the <a href="Romulan%20Neutral%20Zone">Neutral Zone</a> in case of <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a> aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight. Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the "Enterprise" crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. "Enterprise" arrives in time to assist the crew of and its captain, the <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> <a href="Worf">Worf</a>. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship. The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet. "Enterprise" pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears, "Enterprise" discovers Earth has been altered – it is now populated entirely by Borg. Realizing the Borg have used <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> to change the past, "Enterprise" follows the sphere through the vortex.

"Enterprise" arrives hundreds of years in its past on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's <a href="First%20contact%20%28science%20fiction%29">first encounter</a> with alien life after <a href="Zefram%20Cochrane">Zefram Cochrane</a>'s historic <a href="warp%20drive">warp drive</a> flight; the crew realizes the Borg are trying to prevent first contact. After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, "Phoenix", in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to "Enterprise" for medical attention. The captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander <a href="William%20T.%20Riker">William T. Riker</a> on Earth to make sure "Phoenix"s flight proceeds as planned. While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, the real man is reluctant to assume the role the "Enterprise" crew describe.

A group of Borg invade "Enterprise"s lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are forced back; the android <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a> is captured in the melee. A frightened Sloane corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the <a href="holodeck">holodeck</a>. Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, <a href="Lieutenant%20Hawk">Lieutenant Hawk</a>, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling reinforcements by using the <a href="deflector%20dish">deflector dish</a>. As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward. Sloane confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally. Picard orders an activation of the ship's self-destruct, then orders the crew to head for the escape pods while he stays behind to rescue Data.

As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer <a href="Geordi%20La%20Forge">Geordi La Forge</a> prepare to activate the warp drive on "Phoenix", Picard discovers that the <a href="Borg%20Queen">Borg Queen</a> has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has long desired to obtain the android's encryption codes to the "Enterprise" computer. Although Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom, Data refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at "Phoenix". At the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her. The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive vapor eats away the biological components of the Borg. With the Borg threat neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp flight. The next day the crew watches from a distance as an alien <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a> ship, attracted by the "Phoenix" warp test, lands on Earth. Cochrane and Sloane greet the aliens. Having ensured the correction of the timeline, the "Enterprise" crew slip away and return to the 24th century.

"First Contact" is the first film in the "Star Trek" film series in which none of the "" main characters appear. Rather, the main cast of "" play the following characters:


The film features minor roles for many of "The Next Generation"s recurring characters; <a href="Dwight%20Schultz">Dwight Schultz</a> reprised his role of Lieutenant <a href="Reginald%20Barclay">Reginald Barclay</a>, while <a href="Patti%20Yasutake">Patti Yasutake</a> briefly appeared as Nurse . <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> was not asked to return as <a href="Guinan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Guinan</a>, a wise bartender whose homeworld was destroyed by the Borg. Goldberg only learned about the decision through the newspapers. "What can I say? I wanted to do it because I didn't think you could do anything about the Borg without [my character]", she said, "but apparently you can, so they don't need me."

<a href="Michael%20Horton%20%28actor%29">Michael Horton</a> appears as a bloodied and stoic Starfleet Security Officer; his character would be given the name Lt. Daniels in the next "Star Trek" film. <a href="Neal%20McDonough">Neal McDonough</a> plays Lt. Hawk, the "Enterprise" helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed. McDonough was cavalier about his role as a disposable "<a href="redshirt%20%28character%29">redshirt</a>", saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle had to die, "that would be me".

The third draft of the script added cameos by two actors from the sister television series "", which was in its when the film was released. <a href="Robert%20Picardo">Robert Picardo</a> appears as the "Enterprise"s <a href="Emergency%20Medical%20Hologram">Emergency Medical Hologram</a>; Picardo played the holographic <a href="Doctor%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Doctor</a> in "Voyager". He won the cameo after suggesting to producers that the "Enterprise" should have the same technology as "Voyager". Picardo's line "I'm a doctor, not a door stop", is an allusion to the "Star Trek" original series character Dr. <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a>. Picardo's fellow "Voyager" actor <a href="Ethan%20Phillips">Ethan Phillips</a>, who played <a href="Neelix">Neelix</a>, cameos as a nightclub Maitre d' in the holodeck scene. Phillips recalled that the producers wanted the fans to be left guessing whether he was the person who played Neelix or not, as he did not appear in the credits; "It was just kind of a goofy thing to do." During production there were incorrect rumors that <a href="Avery%20Brooks">Avery Brooks</a> would reprise his role as "" captain <a href="Benjamin%20Sisko">Benjamin Sisko</a>. As with many "Star Trek" productions, new, disposable redshirt characters are killed off over the course of the plot.

In February 1995, two months after the release of "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Generations">Star Trek Generations</a>", Paramount decided to produce another "Star Trek" feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers <a href="Brannon%20Braga">Brannon Braga</a> and <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who had written the "Generations" script and a number of "Next Generation" episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a> told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story involving <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a>. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of "The Next Generation", "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," Moore said. "They were fearsome. They were "unstoppable". Perfect foils for a feature story."

In deciding to combine the two story ideas, the writers decided that the time travel element could play out as the Borg attempt to prevent humanity from ever reaching space and becoming a threat. "Our goals at that point were to create a story that was wonderful and a script that was [...] producible within the budget confines of a "Star Trek" film", said Berman. One major question was identifying the time period to which the Borg would travel. Berman's suggestion was the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>; the Borg would attempt to prevent the dawn of modern European civilization. The first story draft, titled "Star Trek: Renaissance", had the crew of the "Enterprise" track the Borg to their hive in a castle dungeon. The film would have featured sword fights alongside phasers in 15th-century Europe, while Data became <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s apprentice. Moore was afraid that it risked becoming campy and over-the-top, while Stewart refused to wear tights. Braga, meanwhile, wanted to see the "birth of "Star Trek"", when the Vulcans and humans first met; "that, to me, is what made the time travel story fresh", he said.

With the idea of "Star Trek"s genesis in mind, the central story became Cochrane's warp drive test and humanity's first contact. Drawing on clues from previous "Star Trek" episodes, Cochrane was placed in mid-21st century Montana, where humans recover from a devastating world war. In the first script with this setting, the Borg attack Cochrane's lab, leaving the scientist comatose; Picard assumes Cochrane's place to continue the warp test and restore history. In this draft Picard has a love interest in the local photographer Ruby, while Riker leads the fight against the Borg on the "Enterprise". Another draft included <a href="John%20de%20Lancie">John de Lancie</a>'s omnipotent character <a href="Q%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Q</a>. Looking at the early scripts, the trio knew that serious work was needed. "It just didn't make sense [...] that Picard, the one guy who has a history with the Borg, never meets them," Braga recalled. Riker and Picard's roles were swapped, and the planetside story was shortened and told differently. Braga and Moore focused the new arc on Cochrane himself, making the ideal future of "Star Trek" come from a flawed man. The idea of Borg fighting among period costumes coalesced into a "Dixon Hill" holographic novel sequence on the holodeck. The second draft, titled "Star Trek: Resurrection", was judged complete enough that the production team used it to plan expenses. The film was given a budget of $45 million, "considerably more" than "Generations" $35 million price tag; this allowed the production to plan a larger amount of action and special effects.
Braga and Moore intended the film to be easily accessible to any moviegoer and work as a stand-alone story, yet still satisfy the devoted "Star Trek" fans. Since much of Picard's role made a direct reference to his time as a Borg in "The Next Generation" episodes "The Best of Both Worlds", the opening <a href="dream%20sequence">dream sequence</a> was added to explain what happened to him in the show. The pair discarded an opening which would have established what the main characters had been doing since the last film in favor of quickly setting the story. While the writers tried to preserve the idea of the Borg as a mindless collective in the original draft, Paramount head Jonathan Dolgen felt that the script was not dramatic enough. He suggested adding an individual Borg villain with whom the characters could interact, which led to the creation of the Borg Queen.

Cast member Frakes was chosen to direct. Frakes had not been the first choice for director; <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> and <a href="John%20McTiernan">John McTiernan</a> reportedly turned down the project. Stewart met a potential candidate and concluded that "they didn't know "Star Trek"". It was decided to stay with someone who understood the "<a href="Gestalt%20psychology">gestalt</a> of "Star Trek"", and Frakes was given the job. Frakes reported to work every day at 6:30 am. A major concern during the production was security—the script to "Generations" had been leaked online, and stronger measures were taken to prevent a similar occurrence. Some script pages were distributed on red paper to foil attempted photocopies or faxes; "We had real trouble reading them," Frakes noted.

Frakes had directed multiple episodes of "The Next Generation", "Deep Space Nine" and "Voyager", but "First Contact" was his first feature film. Whereas Frakes had seven days of preparation followed by seven days of shooting for a given television episode, the director was given a ten-week preparation period before twelve weeks of filming, and had to get used to shooting for a 2.35:1 anamorphic ratio instead of the television standard 1.33:1. In preparation, he watched "<a href="Jaws%20%28film%29">Jaws</a>", "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>", "" and the works of <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> and <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>.

Throughout multiple script revisions a number of titles were considered, including "Star Trek: Borg", "Star Trek: Destinies", "Star Trek: Future Generations" and "Star Trek: Generations II". The planned title of "Resurrection" was scrapped when Fox announced the title of the <a href="Alien%20Resurrection">fourth "Alien" film</a>; the film was rebranded "First Contact" on May 3, 1996.

"First Contact" was the first "Star Trek" film to make significant use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">"Enterprise"-D</a> destroyed during the events of "Generations", the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran "Star Trek" production designer <a href="Herman%20Zimmerman">Herman Zimmerman</a>. The script's only guide on the appearance of the vessel was the line "the new "Enterprise" sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator <a href="John%20Eaves">John Eaves</a>, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-E%29">"Enterprise"-E</a> as "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of <a href="Starship%20Enterprise">previous "Enterprise" iterations</a>, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the "Enterprise"-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a>s. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's <a href="Rick%20Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a>, the model shop at effects house <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> (ILM) fabricated a miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship.

In previous films, Starfleet's range of capital ships had been predominantly represented by the <a href="Constitution%20class%20starship">Constitution class</a> "Enterprise" and just five other ship classes: the <a href="Miranda%20class%20starship">"Miranda" class</a> from "" (represented by the <a href="USS%20Reliant">USS "Reliant"</a>), the "<a href="Excelsior%20class%20starship">Excelsior</a>" and the <a href="Oberth%20class%20starship">"Oberth" class</a> "<a href="USS%20Grissom%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Grissom</a>" from "", and the <a href="Galaxy%20Class">"Galaxy"</a> and <a href="Nebula%20class%20starship">"Nebula" classes</a> from "The Next Generation". ILM supervisor <a href="John%20Knoll">John Knoll</a> insisted that "First Contact"s space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. "And since we figured a lot of the background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was no reason not to do some new designs." <a href="Alex%20Jaeger">Alex Jaeger</a> was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain "Star Trek" ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The <a href="Akira%20class%20starship">"Akira" class</a> featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the "Norway" class was based on the <a href="USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29">USS "Voyager"</a>; the "Saber" class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the "Steamrunner" class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital <a href="wire-frame%20model">wire-frame model</a> for use in the film.

The film also required a number of smaller non-Starfleet designs. The warp ship "Phoenix" was conceived as fitting inside an old nuclear missile, meaning that the ship's nacelles had to fold into a space of less than . Eaves made sure to emphasize the mechanical aspect of the ship, to suggest it was a highly experimental and untested technology. The "Phoenix"s cockpit labels came from <a href="McDonnell-Douglas">McDonnell-Douglas</a> space shuttle manuals. Eaves considered the Vulcan ship a "fun" vessel to design. Only two major Vulcan ships had been previously seen in "Star Trek", including a courier vessel from "". Since the two-engine ship format had been seen many times, the artists decided to step away from the traditional ship layout, creating a more artistic than functional design. The ship incorporated elements of a starfish and a crab. Because of budget constraints, the full ship was realized as a computer-generated design. Only a boomerang-shaped landing foot was fabricated for the actors to interact with.

The "Enterprise" interior sets were mostly new designs. The <a href="Bridge%20%28ship%29">bridge</a> was designed to be comfortable-looking, with warm colors. Among the new additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate only when activated, leaving a plain wall when disabled. New flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays, using less space and giving the bridge a cleaner look. The new monitors also allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with the actors. The designers created a larger and less spartan ready room, retaining elements from the television series; Zimmerman added a set of golden three-dimensional "Enterprise" models to a glass case in the corner. The observation lounge was similar to the design in the "Enterprise"-D; the set itself was re-used from the television show, the only such set not to be struck following the filming of "Generations", though it was expanded and underwent a color change. Engineering was simulated with a large, three-story set, corridors, a lobby, and the largest warp core in the franchise to date. For its Borg-corrupted state, the engineering section was outfitted with Borg drone alcoves, conduits and Data's "assimilation table" where he is interrogated by the Queen. Some existing sets were used to save money; sickbay was a redress of the same location from "Voyager", while the USS "Defiant" scenes used "Deep Space Nine"s standing set. Some set designs took inspiration from the "<a href="Alien%20%28franchise%29">Alien</a>" film series, "Star Wars" and "2001: A Space Odyssey".

The <a href="Extra-vehicular%20activity">spacewalk</a> scene on the "Enterprise" exterior was one of the most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a> that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on <a href="gimbal">gimbal</a>s at Paramount's largest <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>, surrounded by <a href="Chroma%20key">bluescreen</a> and rigged with wires for the <a href="zero%20gravity">zero gravity</a> sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the "Enterprise" dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15 percent.

The <a href="Starfleet%20uniforms">Starfleet uniforms</a> were redesigned for the film by longtime "Star Trek" costumer <a href="Robert%20Blackman">Bob Blackman</a> to give a more militaristic feel, with grey padded shoulders and colored undershirts. Since Blackman was also handling the costumes for the television series, non-Starfleet design clothes were delegated to <a href="Deborah%20Everton">Deborah Everton</a>, a newcomer to "Star Trek" who was responsible for more than 800 costumes during production. Everton was tasked with updating the Borg's costumes to something new, but reminiscent of the television series. The bulky suits were made sleeker and outfitted with <a href="Optical%20fiber">fiber optic</a> lights. The time-travel aspect of the story also required period costumes for the mid 21st century and the 1940s "Dixon Hill" nightclub holodeck recreation. Everton enjoyed designing Woodard's costumes because the character went through many changes during the course of the film, switching from a utilitarian vest and pants in many shots to a glamorous dress during the holodeck scene.
Everton and makeup designers <a href="Michael%20Westmore">Michael Westmore</a>, <a href="Scott%20Wheeler%20%28makeup%20artist%29">Scott Wheeler</a>, and <a href="Jake%20Garber">Jake Garber</a> wanted to upgrade the pasty white look the Borg had retained since "The Next Generation"s second season, born out of a need for budget-conscious television design. "I wanted it to look like they were [assimilated or "Borgified"] from the inside out rather than the outside in," Everton said. Each Borg had a slightly different design, and Westmore designed a new one each day to make it appear that there was an army of Borg; in reality, between eight and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce. Background Borg were simulated by half-finished <a href="mannequin">mannequin</a>s. Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had traveled the galaxy, they would have assimilated other races besides humans. In the television series, much of the Borg's faces had been covered by helmets, but for "First Contact" the makeup artist removed the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar "Star Trek" aliens such as <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>s, <a href="Bolians">Bolians</a>, <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a>s, <a href="Bajoran">Bajoran</a>s, and <a href="Cardassian">Cardassian</a>s. Each drone received an electronic eyepiece. The blinking lights in each eye were programmed by Westmore's son to repeat a production member's name in <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a>.

The makeup time for the Borg expanded from the single hour needed for television to five hours, in addition to the 30 minutes necessary to get into costume and 90 minutes to remove the makeup at the end of the day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, "First Contact" had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," Westmore explained. "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [the Borg's] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil! So, at the very end [of the film], they're more ferocious."

The Borg Queen was a challenge because she had to be unique among Borg but still retain human qualities; Westmore was conscious of avoiding comparisons to films like "Alien". The final appearance involved pale gray skin and an elongated, oval head, with coils of wire rather than hair. Krige recalled the first day she had her makeup applied: "I saw everyone cringing. I thought, great; they made this, and they've scared themselves!" Frakes noted that the Queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way, despite her evil behavior and appearance. Zimmerman, Everton and Westmore combined their efforts to design and create the Borgified sections of the "Enterprise" to build tension and to make the audience feel that "[they are being fed] the Borg".

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took a more leisurely pace than on "The Next Generation" because of a less hectic schedule; only four pages of script had to be filmed each day, as opposed to eight on the television series. "First Contact" saw the introduction of cinematographer <a href="Matthew%20F.%20Leonetti">Matthew F. Leonetti</a> to the "Star Trek" franchise; Frakes hired him out of admiration for some of his previous work on films such as "<a href="Poltergeist%20%281982%20film%29">Poltergeist</a>" and "<a href="Strange%20Days%20%28film%29">Strange Days</a>". Leonetti was unfamiliar with the "Star Trek" mythos when Frakes approached him; to prepare for the assignment, he studied the previous four films in the franchise, each with a different cinematographer—"" (<a href="Donald%20Peterman">Donald Peterman</a>), "" (<a href="Andrew%20Laszlo">Andrew Laszlo</a>), "" (<a href="Hiro%20Narita">Hiro Narita</a>), and "Generations" (<a href="John%20Alonzo">John Alonzo</a>). The cameraman also spent several days at the sets of "Voyager" and "Deep Space Nine" to observe filming.

Leonetti devised multiple lighting methods for the "Enterprise" interiors for ship standard operations, "Red alert" status, and emergency power. He reasoned that since the ship was being taken over by a foreign entity, it required more dramatic lighting and framing. While much of the footage was shot at 50–70 mm focal lengths using anamorphic lenses, 14 mm spherical lenses were used for Borg's-eye-view shots. Leonetti preferred shooting with long lenses to provide a more claustrophobic feel, but made sure the length did not flatten the image. Handheld cameras were used for battle sequences so that viewers were brought into the action and the camera could follow the movements of the actors. The Borg scenes were received positively by <a href="test%20screening">test screening</a> audiences, so once the rest of the film had been completed, a Borg assimilation scene of the "Enterprise" crew was added in using some of the money left in the budget to add action.
Since so many new sets had to be created, the production commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the <a href="Titan%20Missile%20Museum">Titan Missile Museum</a>, south of <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the "Phoenix"s booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the "Phoenix"s nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30 mm lens to lengthen the missile.

After the completion of the "Phoenix" shots, the crew moved to two weeks of nighttime shooting in the Angeles National Forest. Zimmerman created a village of fourteen huts to stand in for Montana; the cast enjoyed the scenes as a chance to escape their uniforms and wear "normal" clothes. The last location shoot was at an <a href="art%20deco">art deco</a> restaurant in Los Angeles' <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Union Station</a>, which stood in for the Dixon Hill holonovel; Frakes wanted a sharp contrast with the dark, mechanical Borg scenes. While the cinematographer wanted to shoot the scene in black and white, Paramount executives deemed the test footage "too experimental" and the idea was dropped. The site made using high-wattage lights impractical, so Leonetti opted to use dimmer master lights near the ceiling and took advantage of a large window to shine diffused lights through. To give the scene a black-and-white feel, Leonetti made sure to use light without any coloration. "I like creating separation with lighting as opposed to using color," he explained. "You can't always rely on color because the actor might start to melt into the background." By separating the backlights, Leonetti made sure that the principal actors stood out of the backdrop. The shoot used a ten-piece orchestra, 15 stuntmen, and 120 extras to fill the seats. Among the nightclub patrons were Braga, Moore, and the film's stunt coordinator, Ronnie Rondell.

After location shooting was completed, shooting on the new Engineering set began May 3. The set lasted less than a day in its pristine condition before it was "Borgified". Filming then proceeded to the bridge. During normal operation scenes, Leonetti chose to cast crosslighting on the principals; this required the ceiling of the set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around the sides. These lights were then directed towards the actors' faces at 90-degree angles. The set was lined with window paneling backed by red lights, which would blink intermittently during red-alert status. These lights were supplemented by what Leonetti called "interactive light"; these were off-stage, red-gelled lights that cast flashing rims on the bridge set and heads of the crew. For the Borg intrusion, the lighting originated solely from instrument panels and red-alert displays. The <a href="fill%20light">fill light</a> on these scenes was reduced so that the cast would pass through dark spots on the bridge and interiors out of the limited range of these sources. Small 30- and 50-watt lights were used to throw localized shafts of light onto the sets.

Next came the action sequences and the battle for the "Enterprise", a phase the filmmakers dubbed "Borg Hell". Frakes directed the Borg scenes similar to a <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, creating as much suspense as possible. To balance these elements he added more comedic elements to the Earth scenes, intended to momentarily relieve the audience of tension before building it up again. Leonetti reconfigured the lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors. "When the ship gets Borgified, everything is changed into more of a squared-off, robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images," he explained. To give the corridor walls more shape, Leonetti lit them from underneath. Since the halls were so small and the ceilings would be visible in many of the shots, special attention was paid to hiding the light fixtures.
For the live-action spacewalk scenes, visual-effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore spent two weeks of bluescreen photography at the deflector set. Frakes regarded filming the scene to be the most tedious in the film because of the amount of preparation it took for each day's shoot. Since the rest of the "Enterprise"-E, as well as the backdrop of Earth, were to be added later in post-production, it became confusing to coordinate shots. Moore used a laptop with digital reproductions of the set to orient the crew and help Frakes understand what the finished shot would look like. A one-armed actor portrayed the Borg whose arm Worf slices off to accurately portray the effect intended, and the actors' shoes were fitted with lead weights to remind the actors they were to move slowly as if actually wearing gravity boots. McDonough recalled that he joined Stewart and Dorn in asking whether they could do the shots without the weights, as "they hired us because we are actors", but the production insisted on using them.

The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One camera shot begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls back to reveal the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot continues to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene was inspired by a <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> production of "<a href="Sweeney%20Todd%2C%20the%20Demon%20Barber%20of%20Fleet%20Street">Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a>" in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens to make it easier for the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000 <a href="Foot-candle">footcandles</a> so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was wide and high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget. Shooting took a total of sixty days.

The majority of "First Contact"s effects were handled by <a href="Industrial%20Light%20and%20Magic">Industrial Light and Magic</a> under the direction of <a href="John%20Knoll">John Knoll</a>. Smaller effects sequences, such as phaser fire, computer graphics, and transporter effects, were delegated to a team led by visual-effects supervisor David Takemura. Accustomed to directing episodes for the television series, Frakes was frequently reminded by effects artist <a href="Terry%20Frazee">Terry Frazee</a> to "think big, blow everything up". Most of the effects sequences were planned using low-resolution computer-generated <a href="Storyboard%23Animatics">animatics</a>. These rough animated storyboards established length, action and composition, allowing the producers and director to ascertain how the sequences would play out before they were shot.

"First Contact" was the last film to feature a physical model of the "Enterprise". For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined <a href="motion%20control">motion control</a> shots of the "Enterprise" model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created "Generations" energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the <a href="Eagle%20Nebula">Eagle Nebula</a>. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make the edges of the nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film "<a href="Twister%20%281996%20film%29">Twister</a>" was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of the "Enterprise" had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.

The opening beauty pass of the new "Enterprise" was the responsibility of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, who handled all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action <a href="Chroma%20key">bluescreen</a> elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the "Enterprise"-D effects for "Generations", but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50 mm lens instead of the 35 mm used for "Generations" because the smaller lens made the new "Enterprise"s dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture a high level of detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics.

For the Borg battle, Knoll insisted on closeup shots that were near the alien vessel, necessitating a physical model. ILM layered their model with an additional five inches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination. To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was, Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke the edges of the frame. To give the Cube greater depth and texture, Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light. "I created this really odd, raking three-quarter backlight coming from the right or left side, which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights. I wanted it to look scary and mysterious, so it was lit like a point, and we always had the camera dutched to it; we never just had it coming straight at us," he said. Small lights attached to the Cube's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale; the model was deliberately shot with a slow, determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg. The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a model of the Cube. The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature. For the final explosion of the Cube, Rosenberg shot ten Cube miniatures with explosive-packed lightweight skins. The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixty feet above the camera on the ground. Safety glass was placed over the lens to prevent damage, while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion. The smaller Borg sphere was a model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post-production. The time-travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re-entry effect; bowshock forms in front of the ship, then streams backwards at high speed. Interactive lighting was played across the computer-generated "Enterprise" model for when the ship is caught in the time vortex.

The miniature "Enterprise" was again used for the spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, it was hard to make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest <a href="F-number">f-stop</a> they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.

ILM was tasked with imagining what the immediate assimilation of an "Enterprise" crewmember would look like. Jaeger came up with a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in with the addition of a skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with <a href="shader">shader</a>s.
Frakes considered the entrance of the Borg Queen—when her head, shoulders, and steel spine are lowered by cables and attached to her body—as the "signature <a href="visual%20effect">visual effect</a> in the film". The scene was difficult to execute, taking ILM five months to finish. Jaeger devised a rig that would lower the actress on the set, and applied a prosthetic spine over a blue suit so that ILM could remove Krige's lower body. This strategy enabled the filmmakers to incorporate as many live-action elements as possible without resorting to further digital effects. To make the prosthetics appear at the proper angle when her lower body was removed, Krige extended her neck forward so it appeared in line with the spine. Knoll did not want it to seem that the Queen was on a hard, mechanical rig; "we wanted her to have the appropriate 'float'," he explained. Using separate motion control passes on the set, Knoll shot the lower of the upper torso and the secondary sequence with Krige's entire body. A digital version of the Borg body suit was used for the lowering sequence, at which point the image was morphed back to the real shot of Krige's body. The animated claws of the suit were created digitally as well using a detailed model. As reference to the animators, the shot required Krige to realistically portray "the strange pain or satisfaction of being reconnected to her body".

Film composer <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> scored "First Contact", his third "Star Trek" feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with <a href="Alexander%20Courage">Alexander Courage</a>'s <a href="Theme%20from%20Star%20Trek">"Star Trek" fanfare</a>. Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's "" score, which is used in "First Contact" as a friendship theme and general thematic link. A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous "Star Trek" scores, including his theme from "The Motion Picture". The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.

Because of delays with Paramount's "<a href="The%20Ghost%20and%20the%20Darkness">The Ghost and the Darkness</a>", the already-short four-week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move, Goldsmith hired his son, <a href="Joel%20Goldsmith">Joel</a>, to assist. The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs and a total of 22 minutes of music. Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately). When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic Jeff Bond termed "almost Coplandesque" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and "Phoenix" flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.

In a break with "Star Trek" film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s "<a href="Dick%20Penner%23Ooby%20Dooby">Ooby Dooby</a>" and <a href="Steppenwolf%20%28band%29">Steppenwolf</a>'s "<a href="Magic%20Carpet%20Ride%20%28Steppenwolf%20song%29">Magic Carpet Ride</a>". <a href="GNP%20Crescendo%20Record%20Co.">GNP Crescendo</a> president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that "Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them".

GNP released the "First Contact" soundtrack on December 2, 1996. The album contained 51 minutes of music, with 35 minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10 minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, "Ooby Dooby" and "Magic Carpet Ride". The compact disc shipped with <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> features only accessible if played on a personal computer, including interviews with Berman, Frakes, and Goldsmith.

On April 2, 2012, GNP Crescendo Records announced a limited-edition collector’s CD featuring the complete score by Jerry Goldsmith (with additional music by Joel Goldsmith), newly remastered by recording engineer Bruce Botnick, with an accompanying 16-page booklet including informative notes by Jeff Bond and John Takis. The expanded album [GNPD 8079] runs 79 minutes and includes three tracks of alternates.

Frakes believes that the main themes of "First Contact"—and "Star Trek" as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This is evident in the film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship with the rest of the crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the "Enterprise" and that of <a href="Ahab%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Captain Ahab</a> in <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s novel "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>". The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar "Moby-Dick" reference was made in "", and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.

In "First Contact", the individually inscrutable and faceless Borg fulfill the role of the similarly unreadable whale in Melville's work. Picard, like Ahab, has been hurt by his nemesis, and author Elizabeth Hinds said it makes sense that Picard should "opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight" the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left, to destroy the ship. Several lines in the film refer to the 21st-century dwellers being primitive, with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n society. In the end it is Lily (the 21st-century woman) who shows Picard (the 24th-century man) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use. Lily's words cause Picard to reconsider, and he quotes Ahab's words of vengeance, recognizing the death wish embedded therein.

The nature of the Borg, specifically as seen in "First Contact", has been the subject of critical discussion. Author Joanna Zylinska notes that while other alien species are tolerated by humanity in "Star Trek", the Borg are viewed differently because of their cybernetic alterations and the loss of personal freedom and autonomy. Members of the crew who are assimilated into the Collective are subsequently viewed as "polluted by technology" and less than human. Zylinska draws comparisons between the technological distinction of humanity and machine in "Star Trek" and the work of artists such as <a href="Stelarc">Stelarc</a>. Oliver Marchart drew parallels between the Borg's combination of many into an artificial One and <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>'s concept of the <a href="Leviathan%20%28Hobbes%20book%29">Leviathan</a>. The nature of perilous first contact between species, as represented by films such as "<a href="Independence%20Day%20%281996%20film%29">Independence Day</a>", "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" and "First Contact," is a marriage of classic fears of national invasion and the loss of personal identity.

1996 marked the 30th anniversary of the "Star Trek" franchise. "First Contact" was heavily marketed, to an extent not seen since the release of "" in 1979. Several novelizations of the film were written for different age groups. <a href="Playmates%20Toys">Playmates Toys</a> produced six- and nine-inch <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a>s in addition to ship models and a phaser. Two "making of" television specials premiered on <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and the <a href="SyFy">Sci-Fi Channel</a>, as well as being promoted during a 30th-anniversary television special on <a href="UPN">UPN</a>. The theatrical trailer to the film was included on a "Best of Star Trek" music compilation, released at the same time as the "First Contact" soundtrack. <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster%20Interactive">Simon & Schuster Interactive</a> developed a Borg-themed video game for Macintosh and Windows personal computers. The game, "", functioned as an <a href="interactive%20movie">interactive movie</a> with scenes filmed at the same time as "First Contact" production. A video game adaptation of the film was also announced by <a href="Spectrum%20Holobyte">Spectrum Holobyte</a>, and would have taken the form of a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game set entirely on the Enterprise during the Borg takeover, though it was never released. Paramount heavily marketed the film on the internet via a "First Contact" web site, which averaged 4.4 million hits a week during the film's opening run, the largest amount of traffic ever on a motion-picture site.

The film premiered on November 18, 1996, at <a href="Mann%27s%20Chinese%20Theater">Mann's Chinese Theater</a> in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Hollywood, Los Angeles</a>. The main cast save Spiner were in attendance, as were Moore, Braga, Jerry Goldsmith, and producer <a href="Marty%20Hornstein">Marty Hornstein</a>. Other "Star Trek" actors present included <a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Auberjonois%20%28actor%29">René Auberjonois</a>, <a href="Avery%20Brooks">Avery Brooks</a>, <a href="Colm%20Meaney">Colm Meaney</a>, <a href="Armin%20Shimerman">Armin Shimerman</a>, <a href="Terry%20Farrell%20%28actress%29">Terry Farrell</a>, <a href="Kate%20Mulgrew">Kate Mulgrew</a>, <a href="Roxann%20Dawson">Roxann Dawson</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Lien">Jennifer Lien</a>, <a href="Robert%20Duncan%20McNeill">Robert Duncan McNeill</a>, <a href="Ethan%20Phillips">Ethan Phillips</a>, <a href="Tim%20Russ">Tim Russ</a>, <a href="Garrett%20Wang">Garrett Wang</a> and <a href="Robert%20Picardo">Robert Picardo</a>. After the screening, 1,500 guests crossed the street to the Hollywood Colonnade, where the interiors had been dressed to match settings from the film: the holodeck nightclub, part of the bridge, a "star room", the Borg hive and the "crash 'n' burn lounge". The film received a royal premiere in the United Kingdom, with the first screening attended by <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>.

"First Contact" opened in 2,812 theaters beginning November 22, grossing $30.7 million its first week and making it the top movie at the US box office. The film was knocked out of the top place the following week by "<a href="101%20Dalmatians%20%281996%20film%29">101 Dalmatians</a>", earning $25.5 million. The film went on to gross $77 million in its first four weeks, remaining in the top ten box office during that time. It closed with a US & Canadian gross of $92,027,888 and an international gross of $54 million for a total of $146 million worldwide. The film was the best-performing "Star Trek" film in international markets until 2009's "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" film, and Paramount's best showing in markets such as New Zealand, making $315,491 from 28 sites by year's end.

"First Contact" garnered positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" considered the film wise to dispense with the cast of "The Original Series:" "For the first time, a "Star Trek" movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that "First Contact" was more in the spirit of the 1960s television series than any previous installment. "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" Elizabeth Renzeti said that "First Contact" succeeded in improving on the "stilted" previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote, ""First Contact" does everything you'd want a "Star Trek" film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." Adrian Martin of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can," he wrote, but "cult-followers will be in heaven". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> said that the "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" of the series, while "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is ever less likely to enjoy." Conversely, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called "First Contact" one of the best "Star Trek" films, and <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> found the film the most entertaining "Star Trek" feature in a decade; "It has single-handedly revived the "Star Trek" movie series, at least from a creative point of view," he wrote.

The film's acting met with mixed reception. <a href="Lisa%20Schwarzbaum">Lisa Schwarzbaum</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" appreciated that guest stars Woodard and Cromwell were used in "inventive contrast" to their better-known images, as a "serious dramatic actress" and "dancing farmer in "<a href="Babe%20%28film%29">Babe</a>"", respectively. <a href="Lloyd%20Rose">Lloyd Rose</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" felt that while Woodard and Cromwell managed to "take care of themselves", Frakes' direction of other actors was not inspired; Steve Persall of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" opined that only Cromwell received a choice role in the film, "so he steals the show by default". A couple of reviews noted that Data's interactions with the Borg Queen were among the most interesting parts of the film; critic John Griffin credited Spiner's work as providing "ambivalent frisson" to the feature. "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine's Adam Smith wrote that some characters, particularly Troi and Crusher, were lost or ignored, and that the rapid pacing of the film left no time for those unfamiliar with the series to know or care about the characters. Likewise, Emily Carlisle of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> praised Woodard's, Spiner's, and Stewart's performances, but felt the film focused more on action than characterization. Stewart, whom Thompson and Renzetti considered overshadowed by <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> in the previous film, received praise from <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>": "As Patrick Stewart delivers [a] line with a majestic ferocity worthy of a <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> alumnus, the audience gapes in awe at a special effect more imposing than any ILM digital doodle. Here is real acting! In a "Star Trek" film!"

The special effects were generally praised. Jay Carr of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" said that "First Contact" successfully updated "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s concept with more elaborate effects and action. Thompson's assessment mirrored Carr's; he agreed that the film managed to convey much of the original 1960s television show, and contained enough "special effects wonders and interstellar gunplay" to sate all types of viewers. Ebert wrote that while previous films had often looked "clunky" in the effects department, "First Contact" benefited from the latest in effects technology. A dissenting opinion was offered by Scott, who wrote that aside from the key effects sequences, Frakes "aims to distract Trekkers from the distinctly cheap-looking remainder".

Critics reacted favorably to the Borg, describing them as akin to creatures from "<a href="Hellraiser%20%28film%20series%29">Hellraiser</a>". Renzetti credited them with breathing "new life" into the crew of the "Enterprise" while simultaneously trying to kill them. The Borg Queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction; Ebert wrote that while the Queen "looks like no notion of sexy I have ever heard of", he was inspired "to keep an open mind". Carr said, "She proves that women with filmy blue skin, lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive."

"First Contact" was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in late 1997 as one of several titles expected to boost sluggish sales at video retailers. A <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> version was also released. "First Contact" was among the first titles announced for the <a href="DVD">DVD</a>-alternative rental system <a href="DIVX%20%28Digital%20Video%20Express%29">Digital Video Express</a> in 1998. It was launched with five other test titles in the select markets of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>.

When Paramount announced its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, "First Contact" was one of the first ten titles released in October, announced in a conscious effort to showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in its original 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a <a href="surround%20sound">surround sound</a> Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.

A "First Contact" "Special Collector's Edition" two-disc set was released in 2005 at the same time as three other "Next Generation" films and ""s fourth season, marking the first time that every film and episode of the franchise was available on home video. In addition to the feature, presented with the same technical specifications as the previous release and a new <a href="DTS%20%28sound%20system%29">DTS</a> soundtrack, the first disc contains Frakes' director's commentary and a track by Moore and Braga. As with other special edition DVD releases, the disc includes a text track by <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael</a> and <a href="Denise%20Okuda">Denise Okuda</a> that provides production trivia and relevant facts about the "Star Trek" universe. The second disc contains six making-of featurettes, storyboards, and trailers.

Paramount announced that all four "Next Generation" films would be released on high-definition <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> on September 22, 2009. "First Contact" special features for the Blu-ray version contain "Scene Deconstruction" featurettes and new commentary by writers <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> and Anthony Pascale.

Sirius

Sirius (, a <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">latinisation</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a> , "Seirios", ."glowing" or "scorching") is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> and the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star</a> in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>. With a visual <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>, the next brightest star. The system has the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> α (<a href="alpha%20%28letter%29">Alpha</a>) Canis Majoris. The binary system consists of a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star of <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> companion of spectral type DA2, designated Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s as they orbit every 50 years.

Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s (8.6 <a href="light-year">ly</a>), as determined by the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">near neighbours</a>. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.

Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun () and has an <a href="Absolute%20magnitude">absolute visual magnitude</a> of +1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a>. The system is between 200 and years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around years ago.

Sirius is also known colloquially as the "Dog Star", reflecting its prominence in its <a href="constellation">constellation</a>, <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a> (Greater Dog). The <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a> of Sirius marked the flooding of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and the "<a href="dog%20days">dog days</a>" of summer for the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a>, while to the <a href="Polynesian%20people">Polynesians</a>, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.

The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Its displacement from the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the <a href="solar%20year">solar year</a>. This occurs at <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> on 19July (<a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian</a>), placing it just prior to the <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a> and the onset of the <a href="flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">annual flooding</a> of the Nile during antiquity.

Owing to the flood's own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star's return made it important to the ancient Egyptians, who worshipped it as the goddess <a href="Sopdet">Sopdet</a> (, "Triangle"; , "Sō̂this"), guarantor of the fertility of their land. The <a href="Egyptian%20civil%20calendar">Egyptian civil calendar</a> was apparently initiated to have its New Year "<a href="Mesori">Mesori</a>" coincide with the appearance of Sirius, although its lack of <a href="leap%20year">leap year</a>s meant that this congruence only held for four years until its date began to wander backwards through the months. The Egyptians continued to note the times of Sirius's annual return, which may have led them to the discovery of the 1460-year <a href="Sothic%20cycle">Sothic cycle</a> and influenced the development of the Julian and <a href="Alexandrian%20calendar">Alexandrian calendar</a>s.

The ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused. Due to its brightness, Sirius would have been noted to <a href="Scintillation%20%28astronomy%29">twinkle</a> more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified certain emanations which caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be "star-struck" (, "astrobólētos"). It was described as "burning" or "flaming" in literature. The season following the star's reappearance came to be known as the "dog days". The inhabitants of the island of <a href="Kea%20%28island%29">Ceos</a> in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> would offer sacrifices to Sirius and <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> to bring cooling breezes, and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius's importance. The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess <a href="Robigo">Robigo</a> so that the star's emanations would not cause <a href="Rust%20%28fungus%29">wheat rust</a> on wheat crops that year.

<a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> of Alexandria mapped the stars in Books VII and VIII of his "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", in which he used Sirius as the location for the globe's central meridian. He depicted it as one of six red-coloured stars (see the <a href="%23Colour%20controversy">Colour controversy</a> section below). The other five are class M and K stars, such as <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>.

Bright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> at 17°S and thus passes directly over the islands each night. Sirius served as the body of a "Great Bird" constellation called "Manu", with Canopus as the southern wingtip and <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a> the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a>, whose name "Takurua" described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a> was marked by celebration in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, where it was known as "Ka'ulua", "Queen of Heaven". Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including "Tau-ua" in the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>, "Rehua" in New Zealand, and "Ta'urua-fau-papa" "Festivity of original high chiefs" and "Ta'urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai" "Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies" in Tahiti. The <a href="Hawaiian%20people">Hawaiian people</a> had many names for Sirius, including "Aa" ("glowing"), "Hoku-kauopae", "Kau-ano-meha" (also "Kaulanomeha"), "Standing-alone-and-sacred", "Hiki-kauelia" or "Hiki-kauilia" (the navigational name), "Hiki-kau-lono-meha" ("star of solitary Lono", the astrological name), "Kaulua" (also "Kaulua-ihai-mohai", "flower of the heavens"), "Hiki-kauelia", "Hoku-hoo-kele-waa" ("star which causes the canoe to sail", a marine navigation name), and "Kaulua-lena" ("yellow star"). The people of the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a> called Sirius variously "Taurua-fau-papa", "Taurua-nui-te-amo-aha", and "Taurua-e-hiti-i-tara-te-feiai". Other names for Sirius included "Palolo-mua" (<a href="Futuna%20Island%2C%20Wallis%20and%20Futuna">Futuna</a>), "Mere" (<a href="Mangaia">Mangaia</a>), "Apura" (<a href="Manihiki">Manihiki</a>), "Taku-ua" (<a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>), and "Tokiva" (<a href="Pukapuka">Pukapuka</a>). In the cosmology of the <a href="Tuamotus">Tuamotus</a>, Sirius had various names, including "Takurua-te-upuupu", "Te Kaha" ("coconut fibre"), "Te Upuupu", "Taranga", and "Vero-ma-torutoru" ("flaming and diminishing").

The indigenous <a href="Wergaia">Boorong</a> people of northwestern Victoria named Sirius as "Warepil".

In 1717, <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> discovered the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of the hitherto presumed "fixed" stars after comparing contemporary <a href="astrometry">astrometric</a> measurements with those from the second century AD given in Ptolemy's "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>". The bright stars <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a>, <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed about 30 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">arc minutes</a> (about the diameter of the Moon) to the southwest.

In 1868, Sirius became the first star to have its velocity measured, the beginning of the study of celestial <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocities</a>. Sir <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> examined the <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of the star and observed a <a href="red%20shift">red shift</a>. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40 km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5 km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun. It's possible that Huggins did not account for the Earth's orbital velocity, which would cause an error of up to 30 km/s.

In his 1698 book, "Cosmotheoros", <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> estimated the distance to Sirius at 27664 times the <a href="Astronomical%20unit">distance from the Earth to the Sun</a> (about 0.437 light years, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the <a href="Stellar%20parallax">parallax</a> of Sirius: by <a href="Jacques%20Cassini">Jacques Cassini</a> (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including <a href="Nevil%20Maskelyne">Nevil Maskelyne</a>) using <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Lacaille</a>'s observations made at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> (4 seconds); by <a href="Giuseppe%20Piazzi">Piazzi</a> (the same amount); using <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Lacaille</a>'s observations made at <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no sensible parallax); by <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Bessel</a> (no sensible parallax).

Scottish astronomer <a href="Thomas%20Henderson%20%28astronomer%29">Thomas Henderson</a> was the first to gain some meaningful value using his observations made in 1832–1833 and South African astronomer <a href="Thomas%20Maclear">Thomas Maclear</a>'s observations made in 1836–1837, and was published in 1839. The value of the parallax was 0.23 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s, and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or in Henderson's words, "On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less." Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25 arcseconds for much of the 19th century. It is now known to have a parallax of arcseconds and therefore a distance of parsecs, showing Henderson's measurement to be accurate.

In 1844, the German astronomer <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a> deduced from changes in the proper motion of Sirius that it had an unseen companion. On January 31, 1862, American telescope-maker and astronomer <a href="Alvan%20Graham%20Clark">Alvan Graham Clark</a> first observed the faint companion, which is now called Sirius B, or affectionately "the Pup". This happened during testing of an aperture <a href="great%20refractor">great refractor</a> telescope for <a href="Dearborn%20Observatory">Dearborn Observatory</a>, which was the largest refracting telescope lens in existence at the time, and the largest telescope in the United States. Sirius B's sighting was confirmed on March 8 with smaller telescopes.

The visible star is now sometimes known as Sirius A. Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed. The best fit to the data indicates a six-year orbit around Sirius A and a mass of . This star would be five to ten magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf Sirius B, which would make it difficult to observe. Observations published in 2008 were unable to detect either a third star or a planet. An apparent "third star" observed in the 1920s is now believed to be a background object.

In 1915, <a href="Walter%20Sydney%20Adams">Walter Sydney Adams</a>, using a 60-inch (1.5 m) reflector at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>, observed the <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of Sirius B and determined that it was a faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by <a href="Robert%20Hanbury%20Brown">Robert Hanbury Brown</a> and <a href="Richard%20Q.%20Twiss">Richard Q. Twiss</a> in 1959 at <a href="Jodrell%20Bank">Jodrell Bank</a> using their stellar <a href="intensity%20interferometer">intensity interferometer</a>. In 2005, using the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.

Around the year 150 CE, the Greek astronomer of the Roman period <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy</a> described Sirius as reddish, along with five other stars, <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>, <a href="Antares">Antares</a>, <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a>, <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>, all of which are of orange or red hue. The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer <a href="Thomas%20Barker%20%28meteorologist%29">Thomas Barker</a>, squire of <a href="Lyndon%2C%20Rutland">Lyndon Hall</a> in <a href="Rutland">Rutland</a>, who prepared a paper and spoke at a meeting of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in London in 1760. The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credibility to the idea that some may change in colour too; <a href="Sir%20John%20Herschel">Sir John Herschel</a> noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing <a href="Eta%20Carinae">Eta Carinae</a> two years earlier. <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Jackson%20See">Thomas Jefferson Jackson See</a> resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final summary in 1926. He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a>, the orator <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, and general <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a> as calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus' poem "Phaenomena". <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a> had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. Not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Marcus Manilius</a> described it as "sea-blue", as did the 4th century <a href="Avienus">Avienus</a>. It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BCE up to the 7th century CE all describe Sirius as white.

In 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century <a href="Lombardy">Lombardic</a> manuscript, which contains "De cursu stellarum ratio" by St. <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>. The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and Sirius is described within as "rubeola" – "reddish". The authors proposed this was further evidence Sirius B had been a red giant at the time. Other scholars replied that it was likely St. Gregory had been referring to <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>.

The possibility that <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a> of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic <a href="scintillation%20%28astronomy%29">scintillations</a> of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.

With an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of −1.46, Sirius is the brightest star in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>, almost twice as bright as the second-brightest star, <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>. From <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, Sirius always appears dimmer than <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Venus">Venus</a>, as well as <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> and <a href="Mars">Mars</a> at certain times. Sirius is visible from almost everywhere on Earth, except latitudes <a href="northernmost%20settlements">north of 73° N</a>, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities (reaching only 13° above the horizon from <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>). Due to its <a href="declination">declination</a> of roughly −17°, Sirius is a <a href="circumpolar%20star">circumpolar star</a> from latitudes south of 73° S. From the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun.

Sirius, along with <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a> and <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>, forms one of the three <a href="vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertices</a> of the <a href="Winter%20Triangle">Winter Triangle</a> to observers in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. 

Due to <a href="precession">precession</a> (and slight <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and in most parts of Australia.

Sirius can be observed in <a href="daylight">daylight</a> with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.

The orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s and a maximum of 11 arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300 mm (12 in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A <a href="periastron">periastron</a> occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.

At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">nearest stars</a> to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> (not including the Sun), and is the fifth closest stellar system to ours (again not including the Sun). This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">α Centauri</a> and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>, <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> or <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>. It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun. The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a>, 1.61 parsecs (5.24 ly) away. The "<a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>" spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four <a href="Jovian%20planets">Jovian planets</a> in the Solar System, is expected to pass within of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years. 

Sirius is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system consisting of two white stars orbiting each other with a separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star of <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a <a href="infrared%20excess">higher than expected level of infrared radiation</a>, as measured by <a href="IRAS">IRAS</a> space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.

In 2015, Vigan and colleagues used the <a href="VLT%20Survey%20Telescope">VLT Survey Telescope</a> to search for evidence of substellar companions, and were able to rule out the presence of giant planets 11 times more massive than Jupiter at 0.5 au distance from Sirius A, 6–7
times the mass of Jupiter at 1–2 au distance, and down to around 4 times the mass of Jupiter at 10 au distance.

Sirius A has a mass of . The radius of this star has been measured by an <a href="astronomical%20interferometer">astronomical interferometer</a>, giving an estimated angular diameter of 5.936±0.016 <a href="milliarcsecond">mas</a>. The <a href="stellar%20rotation">projected rotational velocity</a> is a relatively low 16 km/s, which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk. This is at marked variance with the similar-sized <a href="Vega">Vega</a>, which rotates at a much faster 274 km/s and bulges prominently around its equator. A weak <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> has been detected on the surface of Sirius A.

Stellar models suggest that the star formed during the collapsing of a <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>, and that after years, its internal energy generation was derived entirely from nuclear reactions. The core became <a href="convection%20zone">convective</a> and used the <a href="CNO%20cycle">CNO cycle</a> for energy generation. It is predicted that Sirius A will have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion (10) years of its formation. At this point it will pass through a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stage, then settle down to become a white dwarf.

Sirius A is classed as an <a href="Am%20star">Am star</a> because the spectrum shows deep metallic <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s, indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron. The spectral type has been reported as A0mA1 Va, which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars. When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by formula_1, meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.

Sirius B is one of the more massive <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s known. With a mass of it is almost double the average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth's. The current surface temperature is 25,200 K. Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over more than two billion years.

A white dwarf forms only after the star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated and was a <a href="B-type%20star">B-type star</a> (roughly B4–5) when it was still on the main sequence. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> of its companion.

This star is primarily composed of a carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star. This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity. The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.

Since 1894, there have been observed irregularities in the orbits of Sirius A and B with an apparent periodicity of 6–6.4 years. A 1995 study found such a companion to likely exist, with a mass of roughly 0.05 solar masses- a small <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> or large <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>, with an apparent magnitude of >15, and less than 3 arcseconds from Sirius A.

More recent (and accurate) astrometric observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out the possibility of such an object entirely. The 1995 study predicted an astrometric movement of roughly 90 <a href="Milliarcsecond">mas</a> (0.09 arcseconds), although Hubble was unable to detect any location anomaly to an accuracy of 5 mas (0.005 arcsec). This ruled out any objects orbiting Sirius A with more than 0.033 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.014 in 2 years. They were additionally able to rule out any companions to Sirius B with more than 0.024 solar masses orbiting in 0.5 years, and 0.0095 orbiting in 1.8 years. Effectively, there are almost certainly no additional bodies in the Sirius system larger than a small brown dwarf or large exoplanet.

In 1909, <a href="Ejnar%20Hertzsprung">Ejnar Hertzsprung</a> was the first to suggest that Sirius was a member of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20Moving%20Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a>, based on his observations of the system's movements across the sky. The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220 stars that share a common motion through space and were once formed as members of an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>, which has since become gravitationally unbound. Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius's membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 ± 100 million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun's, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group. Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as <a href="Beta%20Aurigae">Beta Aurigae</a>, <a href="Alpha%20Coronae%20Borealis">Alpha Coronae Borealis</a>, <a href="Beta%20Crateris">Beta Crateris</a>, <a href="Beta%20Eridani">Beta Eridani</a> and <a href="Beta%20Serpentis">Beta Serpentis</a>. This is one of three large clusters located within of the Sun. The other two are the <a href="Hyades%20%28star%20cluster%29">Hyades</a> and the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a>, and each of these clusters consists of hundreds of stars.

In 2017, a massive star cluster was discovered only 10' from Sirius. It was discovered during a statistical analysis of <a href="Gaia%20%28spacecraft%29">Gaia</a> data. The cluster is over a thousand times further away from us than the star system.

The most commonly used proper name of this star comes from the Latin "Sīrius", from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "Σείριος" ("Seirios", "glowing" or "scorcher"), although the Greek word itself may have been imported from elsewhere before the <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">Archaic period</a>, one authority suggesting a link with the Egyptian god <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>. The name's earliest recorded use dates from the 7th century BC in <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s poetic work "<a href="Works%20and%20Days">Works and Days</a>". In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Sirius" for the star α Canis Majoris A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Sirius has over 50 other designations and names attached to it. In <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s essay "<a href="Treatise%20on%20the%20Astrolabe">Treatise on the Astrolabe</a>", it bears the name Alhabor and is depicted by a hound's head. This name is widely used on medieval <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a>s from Western Europe. In <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> it is known as "Mrgavyadha" "deer hunter", or "Lubdhaka" "hunter". As Mrgavyadha, the star represents <a href="Rudra">Rudra</a> (<a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>). The star is referred as "Makarajyoti" in <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> and has religious significance to the pilgrim center <a href="Sabarimala">Sabarimala</a>. In <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, the star has been known as "Lokabrenna" ("burning done by Loki", or "Loki's torch"). In the <a href="astrology">astrology</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Sirius was a <a href="Behenian%20fixed%20star">Behenian fixed star</a>, associated with <a href="beryl">beryl</a> and <a href="juniper">juniper</a>. Its astrological symbol was listed by <a href="Heinrich%20Cornelius%20Agrippa">Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa</a>.

Many cultures have historically attached special significance to Sirius, particularly in relation to <a href="dog">dog</a>s. It is often colloquially called the "Dog Star" as the brightest star of <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a>, the "Great Dog" constellation.

It was classically depicted as <a href="Orion%20%28mythology%29">Orion</a>'s dog. The Ancient Greeks thought that Sirius's emanations could affect dogs adversely, making them behave abnormally during the "dog days", the hottest days of the summer. The Romans knew these days as , and the star Sirius was called Canicula, "little dog". The excessive panting of dogs in hot weather was thought to place them at risk of desiccation and disease. In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have rabies, which could infect and kill humans they had bitten. <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", describes the approach of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> toward <a href="Troy">Troy</a> in these words:
In Iranian mythology, especially in <a href="Persian%20mythology">Persian mythology</a> and in <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>, the ancient religion of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, Sirius appears as "<a href="Tishtrya">Tishtrya</a>" and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of <a href="New%20Persian">New Persian</a> poetry). Beside passages in the <a href="sacred%20texts">sacred texts</a> of the <a href="Avesta">Avesta</a>, the <a href="Avestan">Avestan</a> language "Tishtrya" followed by the version "Tir" in <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle</a> and New Persian is also depicted in the <a href="Persian%20literature">Persian</a> epic <a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a> of <a href="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</a>. Due to the concept of the <a href="yazatas">yazatas</a>, powers which are "worthy of worship", Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of <a href="apaosha">apaosha</a>, the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is depicted as a white horse.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a> Sirius is known as the star of the "celestial wolf" ( <a href="Pinyin">Chinese romanization</a>: Tiānláng; <a href="Romanization%20of%20Japanese">Japanese romanization</a>: Tenrō;) in the <a href="Well%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Mansion of Jǐng</a> (井宿). Many nations among the indigenous peoples of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> also associated Sirius with canines; the <a href="Seri%20people">Seri</a> and <a href="Tohono%20O%27odham%20people">Tohono O'odham</a> of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the <a href="Blackfoot">Blackfoot</a> called it "Dog-face". The <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> paired Sirius with <a href="Antares">Antares</a> as a dog-star guardian of either end of the "Path of Souls". The <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a> of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the "Wolf Star", while other branches knew it as the "Coyote Star". Further north, the Alaskan <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> of the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a> called it "Moon Dog".

Several cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a> and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">Temple of Hathor</a> in <a href="Dendera">Dendera</a>, where the goddess <a href="Satet">Satet</a> has drawn her arrow at <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> (Sirius). Known as "Tir", the star was portrayed as the arrow itself in later Persian culture.

Sirius is mentioned in "<a href="Surah">Surah</a>", "<a href="An-Najm">An-Najm</a>" ("The Star"), of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>, where it is given the name (transliteration: "aš-ši‘rā" or "ash-shira"; the leader). The verse is: "", "That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star)." (An-Najm:49) <a href="Ibn%20Kathir">Ibn Kathir</a> said in his commentary "that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship". The alternate name "Aschere", used by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>, is derived from this.

In <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophy</a>, it is believed the "Seven Stars of the <a href="Pleiades%20in%20folklore%20and%20literature">Pleiades</a>" transmit the <a href="spiritual%20energy">spiritual energy</a> of the <a href="Seven%20Rays%23In%20Theosophy">Seven Rays</a> from the "Galactic Logos" to the "Seven Stars of the <a href="Ursa%20Major">Great Bear</a>", then to Sirius. From there is it sent via the Sun to the god of Earth (<a href="Sanat%20Kumara">Sanat Kumara</a>), and finally through the seven <a href="Masters%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Wisdom">Masters of the Seven Rays</a> to the human race.

The <a href="Dogon%20people">Dogon people</a> are an <a href="ethnic">ethnic</a> group in <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, West Africa, reported by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible without the use of telescopes. In 1938 <a href="Marcel%20Griaule">Marcel Griaule</a> produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the <a href="%C3%89cole%20pratique%20des%20hautes%20%C3%A9tudes">École pratique des hautes études</a> (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books "Conversations with Ogotemmêli" 1965 and "The Pale Fox" 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. <a href="Robert%20K.%20G.%20Temple">Robert Temple</a>'s 1976 book "<a href="The%20Sirius%20Mystery">The Sirius Mystery</a>" credits them with knowledge of the four <a href="Galilean%20moons">Galilean moons</a> of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and the <a href="rings%20of%20Saturn">rings of Saturn</a>. This has been the subject of controversy and speculation.
Doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlein's work. In a 1991 article in "<a href="Current%20Anthropology">Current Anthropology</a>" anthropologist Walter van Beek concluded after his research among the Dogon that, "Though they do speak about "sigu tolo" [which is what Griaule claimed the Dogon called Sirius] they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant; for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the "sigu" [festival], for another it is Venus that, through a different position, appears as "sigu tolo". All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule."

<a href="Noah%20Brosch">Noah Brosch</a> explained in his book "Sirius Matters" that the cultural transfer of relatively modern astronomical information could have taken place in 1893, when a French expedition arrived in Central West Africa to observe the total eclipse on April 16.

In the <a href="Serer%20religion">religion</a> of the <a href="Serer%20people">Serer people</a> of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="the%20Gambia">the Gambia</a> and <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, Sirius is called "Yoonir" from the <a href="Serer%20language">Serer language</a> (and some of the <a href="Cangin%20languages">Cangin language</a> speakers, who are all ethnically Serers). The star Sirius is one of the most important and sacred stars in <a href="Serer%20religion%23Cosmology">Serer religious cosmology</a> and symbolism. The Serer high priests and priestesses (<a href="Saltigue">Saltigue</a>s, the hereditary "rain priests") chart "Yoonir" in order to forecast rainfall and enable Serer farmers to start planting seeds.

Serpens

Serpens ("the Serpent", <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ) is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a>. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, it remains one of the 88 <a href="modern%20constellations">modern constellations</a> defined by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>. It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of <a href="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>, the "Serpent-Bearer". In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between <a href="Mu%20Serpentis">Mu Serpentis</a> in "Serpens Caput" and <a href="Nu%20Serpentis">Nu Serpentis</a> in "Serpens Cauda".

The brightest <a href="List%20of%20stars%20in%20Serpens">star in Serpens</a> is the <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> star <a href="Alpha%20Serpentis">Alpha Serpentis</a>, or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 2.63. Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked-eye <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> <a href="Messier%205">Messier 5</a> and the naked-eye <a href="variable%20star">variables</a> <a href="R%20Serpentis">R Serpentis</a> and <a href="Tau4%20Serpentis">Tau Serpentis</a>. Notable extragalactic objects include <a href="Seyfert%27s%20Sextet">Seyfert's Sextet</a>, one of the densest galaxy clusters known; <a href="Arp%20220">Arp 220</a>, the prototypical <a href="ultraluminous%20infrared%20galaxy">ultraluminous infrared galaxy</a>; and <a href="Hoag%27s%20Object">Hoag's Object</a>, the most famous of the very rare class of galaxies known as <a href="ring%20galaxy">ring galaxies</a>.

Part of the Milky Way's <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a> passes through Serpens Cauda, which is therefore rich in galactic <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s, such as the <a href="Eagle%20Nebula">Eagle Nebula</a> (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster <a href="Messier%2016">Messier 16</a>. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the <a href="Pillars%20of%20Creation">Pillars of Creation</a>, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. Other striking objects include the <a href="Red%20Square%20Nebula">Red Square Nebula</a>, one of the few objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and <a href="Westerhout%2040">Westerhout 40</a>, a massive nearby <a href="star%20formation">star-forming region</a> consisting of a <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a> and an <a href="H%20II%20region">H II region</a>.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Serpens represents a <a href="snake">snake</a> held by the healer <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a>. Represented in the sky by the constellation <a href="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, but the majority of atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body or between his legs.

In some ancient atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were depicted as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown as a single constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s from those of Ophiuchus. When <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed the problem of how to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, "caput" being the Latin word for head and "cauda" the Latin word for tail.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, most of the stars of Serpens represented part of a wall surrounding a marketplace, known as <a href="Tianshi">Tianshi</a>, which was in Ophiuchus and part of <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>. Serpens also contains a few <a href="Chinese%20constellations">Chinese constellations</a>. Two stars in the tail represented part of <a href="Shilou">Shilou</a>, the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented <a href="Liesi">Liesi</a>, jewel shops. One star in the head (<a href="Mu%20Serpentis">Mu Serpentis</a>) marked <a href="Tianru">Tianru</a>, the <a href="crown%20prince">crown prince</a>'s wet nurse, or sometimes <a href="rain">rain</a>.

There were two "serpent" constellations in <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Babylonian astronomy</a>, known as Mušḫuššu and Bašmu. It appears that Mušḫuššu was depicted as a hybrid of a dragon, a lion and a bird, and loosely corresponded to <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>. Bašmu was a <a href="horned%20serpent">horned serpent</a> (c.f. <a href="Ningishzida">Ningishzida</a>) and roughly corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> on which the Ὄφις ("Serpens") of Ptolemy is based.

Serpens is the only one of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> to be split into two disconnected regions in the sky: "Serpens Caput" (the head) and "Serpens Cauda" (the tail). The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.

Serpens Caput is bordered by <a href="Libra%20%28constellation%29">Libra</a> to the south, <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a> and <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a> to the east, <a href="Corona%20Borealis">Corona Borealis</a> to the north, and Ophiuchus and <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a> to the west; Serpens Cauda is bordered by <a href="Sagittarius%20%28constellation%29">Sagittarius</a> to the south, <a href="Scutum%20%28constellation%29">Scutum</a> and <a href="Aquila%20%28constellation%29">Aquila</a> to the east, and Ophiuchus to the north and west. Covering 636.9 <a href="square%20degree">square degree</a>s total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. Its main <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5, the traditional limit for naked-eye visibility.

Serpens Caput's boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a 15-sided polygon, while Serpens Cauda's are defined by a 25-sided polygon. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of Serpens Caput's borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between and . Serpens Cauda's boundaries lie between right ascensions of and and declinations of and . The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation "Ser" for the constellation in 1922.

Marking the heart of the serpent is the constellation's brightest star, <a href="Alpha%20Serpentis">Alpha Serpentis</a>. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is <a href="Lambda%20Serpentis">Lambda Serpentis</a>, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another <a href="solar%20analog">solar analog</a> in Serpens is the primary of <a href="Psi%20Serpentis">Psi Serpentis</a>, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.

<a href="Beta%20Serpentis">Beta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Serpentis">Gamma</a>, and <a href="Iota%20Serpentis">Iota Serpentis</a> form a distinctive triangular shape marking the head of the snake, with <a href="Kappa%20Serpentis">Kappa Serpentis</a> (the proper name is Gudja) being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a> <a href="R%20Serpentis">R Serpentis</a>, situated between Beta and Gamma, is visible to the naked eye at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a> located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show <a href="solar-like%20oscillations">solar-like oscillations</a>.

<a href="Delta%20Serpentis">Delta Serpentis</a>, forming part of the body of the snake between the heart and the head, is a multiple star system positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth, although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light. The primary, a white subgiant, is a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a> with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23. Positioned very near Delta, both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs, is the <a href="barium%20star">barium star</a> <a href="16%20Serpentis">16 Serpentis</a>. Another notable variable star visible to the naked eye is <a href="Chi%20Serpentis">Chi Serpentis</a>, an <a href="Alpha%C2%B2%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable</a> situated midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.

The two stars in Serpens Caput that form part of the Snake's body below the heart are <a href="Epsilon%20Serpentis">Epsilon</a> and <a href="Mu%20Serpentis">Mu Serpentis</a>, both third-magnitude <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">A-type main-sequence star</a>s. Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an <a href="Am%20star">Am star</a>, while Mu is a binary. Located slightly northwest of Mu is <a href="36%20Serpentis">36 Serpentis</a>, another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a <a href="Lambda%20Bo%C3%B6tis%20star">Lambda Boötis star</a>, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, while containing very low amounts of <a href="iron%20peak">iron peak</a> elements. <a href="25%20Serpentis">25 Serpentis</a>, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> consisting of a hot <a href="blue%20giant">B-type giant</a> and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a <a href="slowly%20pulsating%20B%20star">slowly pulsating B star</a>, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.

Serpens Caput contains many <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae variable</a>s, although most are too faint to be seen without professional photography. The brightest is <a href="VY%20Serpentis">VY Serpentis</a>, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star of a different kind is <a href="Tau4%20Serpentis">Tau Serpentis</a>, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse <a href="P%20Cygni%20profile">P Cygni profile</a>, where cold infalling gas on to the star creates <a href="redshift">redshift</a>ed hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.

Several stars in Serpens have been found to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>. The brightest, <a href="Omega%20Serpentis">Omega Serpentis</a>, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an <a href="orange%20giant">orange giant</a> with a planet of at least 1.7 <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-masses. <a href="NN%20Serpentis">NN Serpentis</a>, an eclipsing <a href="Common%20envelope">post-common-envelope binary</a> consisting of a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> and a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>, is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses. Although it does not have a planet, the solar analog <a href="HD%20137510">HD 137510</a> has been found to have a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> companion within the <a href="brown-dwarf%20desert">brown-dwarf desert</a>.

<a href="PSR%20B1534%2B11">PSR B1534+11</a> is a system consisting of two <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s orbiting each other, one of which is a <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a> with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, validating the system's relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory. The <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> emission from the system has been found to be present when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial <a href="pulsar%20wind">pulsar wind</a> of the pulsar, and the system's orbit has been found to vary slightly.

The brightest star in the tail, <a href="Eta%20Serpentis">Eta Serpentis</a>, is similar to Alpha Serpentis' primary in that it is a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours. The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are <a href="Theta%20Serpentis">Theta</a> and <a href="Xi%20Serpentis">Xi Serpentis</a>. Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away. Two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an <a href="angular%20separation">angular separation</a> of only 2.2 milli<a href="arcseconds">arcseconds</a>, and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment. The primary is a <a href="white%20giant">white giant</a> with an excess of <a href="strontium">strontium</a>. Theta, forming the tip of the tail, is also a multiple system, consisting of two A-type main-sequence stars with a combined apparent magnitude of around 4.1 separated by almost half an arcminute.

Lying near the boundary with Ophiuchus are <a href="Zeta%20Serpentis">Zeta</a>, <a href="Nu%20Serpentis">Nu</a>, and <a href="Omicron%20Serpentis">Omicron Serpentis</a>. All three are 4th-magnitude main-sequence stars, with Nu and Omicron being of spectral type A and Zeta being of spectral type F. Nu is a single star with a 9th-magnitude visual companion, while Omicron is a Delta Scuti variable with amplitude variations of 0.01 magnitudes. In 1909, the <a href="symbiotic%20nova">symbiotic nova</a> <a href="RT%20Serpentis">RT Serpentis</a> appeared near Omicron, although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10.

The star system <a href="59%20Serpentis">59 Serpentis</a>, also known as d Serpentis, is a triple star system consisting of a spectroscopic binary containing an A-type star and an orange giant and an orange giant secondary. The system shows <a href="irregular%20variable">irregular variations in brightness</a> between magnitudes 5.17 and 5.2. In 1970, the nova <a href="FH%20Serpentis">FH Serpentis</a> appeared just slightly north of 59 Serpentis, reaching a maximum brightness of 4.5. Also near 59 Serpentis in the <a href="Serpens%20Cloud">Serpens Cloud</a> are several <a href="Orion%20variable">Orion variable</a>s. <a href="MWC%20297">MWC 297</a> is a <a href="Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star">Herbig Be star</a> that in 1994 exhibited a large <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> flare and increased in X-ray luminosity by five times before returning to the quiescent state. The star also appears to possess a <a href="circumstellar%20disk">circumstellar disk</a>. Another Orion variable in the region is <a href="VV%20Serpentis">VV Serpentis</a>, a Herbig Ae star that has been found to exhibit Delta Scuti pulsations. VV Serpentis has also, like MWC 297, been found to have a dusty disk surrounding it, and is also a <a href="UX%20Orionis%20star">UX Orionis star</a>, meaning that it shows irregular variations in its brightness.

The star <a href="HR%206958">HR 6958</a>, also known as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha Canum Venaticorum variable that is faintly visible to the naked eye. The star's metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. Barely visible to the naked eye is <a href="HD%20172365">HD 172365</a>, a likely post-<a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a> in the open cluster <a href="IC%204756">IC 4756</a> that contains a large excess of <a href="lithium">lithium</a>. <a href="HD%20172189">HD 172189</a>, also located in IC 4756, is an <a href="Algol%20variable">Algol variable</a> eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.

As the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a> passes through it, Serpens Cauda contains many massive <a href="OB%20star">OB star</a>s. Several of these are visible to the naked eye, such as <a href="NW%20Serpentis">NW Serpentis</a>, an early <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> that has been found to be somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between <a href="Beta%20Cephei%20variable">Beta Cephei variable</a>s and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, <a href="HD%20167971">HD 167971</a> (MY Serpentis) is a <a href="Beta%20Lyrae%20variable">Beta Lyrae variable</a> triple system consisting of three very hot <a href="O-type%20star">O-type star</a>s. A member of the cluster <a href="NGC%206604">NGC 6604</a>, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or <a href="blue%20supergiant">supergiant</a> of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the <a href="HD%20166734">HD 166734</a> system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is <a href="HD%20161701">HD 161701</a>, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a <a href="B-type%20star">B-type</a> primary and an <a href="Ap%20star">Ap</a> secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and an Ap star.

South of the <a href="Eagle%20Nebula">Eagle Nebula</a> on the border with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary <a href="W%20Serpentis">W Serpentis</a>, whose primary is a white giant that is interacting with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>, and was one of the first discovered <a href="Serpentid">Serpentid</a>s, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong <a href="far-ultraviolet">far-ultraviolet</a> spectral lines. It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve first into <a href="double%20periodic%20variable">double periodic variable</a>s and then classical Algol variables. Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet</a> binary <a href="CV%20Serpentis">CV Serpentis</a>, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped <a href="nebula">nebula</a>, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.

Serpens Cauda contains a few <a href="X-ray%20binary">X-ray binaries</a>. One of these, <a href="GX%2017%2B2">GX 17+2</a>, is a <a href="low-mass%20X-ray%20binary">low-mass X-ray binary</a> consisting of a neutron star and, as in all low-mass X-ray binaries, a low-mass star. The system has been classified as a <a href="Z%20source">Sco-like Z source</a>, meaning that its accretion is near the <a href="Eddington%20limit">Eddington limit</a>. The system has also been found to approximately every 3 days brighten by around 3.5 <a href="Apparent%20magnitude%23Standard%20reference%20values">K-band</a> magnitudes, possibly due to the presence of a <a href="synchrotron%20radiation">synchrotron jet</a>. Another low-mass X-ray binary, <a href="Serpens%20X-1">Serpens X-1</a>, undergoes occasional X-ray bursts. One in particular lasted nearly four hours, possibly explained by the burning of carbon in "a heavy element ocean".

As the galactic plane does not pass through this part of Serpens, a view to many galaxies beyond it is possible. However, a few structures of the Milky Way Galaxy are present in Serpens Caput, such as <a href="Messier%205">Messier 5</a>, a <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> positioned approximately 8° southwest of α Serpentis, next to the star <a href="5%20Serpentis">5 Serpentis</a>. Barely visible to the naked eye under good conditions, and is located approximately 25,000 ly distant. Messier 5 contains a large number of known RR Lyrae variable stars, and is receding from us at over 50 km/s. The cluster contains two <a href="millisecond%20pulsar">millisecond pulsar</a>s, one of which is in a binary, allowing the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of the cluster to be measured. The binary could help our understanding of <a href="neutron%20degenerate%20matter">neutron degenerate matter</a>; the current median mass, if confirmed, would exclude any "soft" <a href="equation%20of%20state">equation of state</a> for such matter. The cluster has been used to test for <a href="magnetic%20dipole%20moment">magnetic dipole moment</a>s in neutrinos, which could shed light on some hypothetical particles such as the <a href="axion">axion</a>. Another globular cluster is <a href="Palomar%205">Palomar 5</a>, found just south of Messier 5. Many stars are leaving this globular cluster due to the Milky Way's gravity, forming a <a href="tidal%20tail">tidal tail</a> over 30000 light-years long.

The <a href="L134%20%28nebula%29">L134</a>/<a href="L183">L183</a> is a <a href="dark%20nebula">dark nebula</a> complex that, along with a third cloud, is likely formed by fragments of a single original cloud located 36 degrees away from the galactic plane, a large distance for dark nebulae. The entire complex is thought to be around 140 parsecs distant. L183, also referred to as L134N, is home to several infrared sources, indicating pre-stellar sources thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and prestellar cores. The core is split into three regions, with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses.

Outside of the Milky Way, there are no bright deep-sky objects for amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The brightest is <a href="NGC%205962">NGC 5962</a>, a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11.34. Slightly fainter is <a href="NGC%205921">NGC 5921</a>, a <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with a <a href="LINER">LINER</a>-type <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a> situated somewhat closer at a distance of 21 megaparsecs. A <a href="type%20II%20supernova">type II supernova</a> was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X. Fainter still are the spirals <a href="NGC%205964">NGC 5964</a> and <a href="NGC%206118">NGC 6118</a>, with the latter being host to the <a href="supernova">supernova</a> <a href="SN%202004dk">SN 2004dk</a>.
<a href="Hoag%27s%20Object">Hoag's Object</a>, located 600 million light-years from Earth, is a member of the very rare class of galaxies known as <a href="Ring%20galaxy">ring galaxies</a>. The outer ring is largely composed of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. <a href="Arp%20220">Arp 220</a> is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical <a href="ultraluminous%20infrared%20galaxy">ultraluminous infrared galaxy</a>, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of <a href="galactic%20collision">colliding</a> with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a> throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies <a href="NGC%205953/5954">NGC 5953 and NGC 5954</a>. In this case, both are <a href="active%20galaxy">active galaxies</a>, with the former a <a href="Seyfert%202%20galaxy">Seyfert 2 galaxy</a> and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.

<a href="Seyfert%27s%20Sextet">Seyfert's Sextet</a> is a <a href="galaxy%20group">group</a> of six galaxies, four of which are <a href="interacting%20galaxy">interacting gravitationally</a> and two of which simply appear to be a part of the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound <a href="galaxy%20cluster">cluster</a> lies at a distance of 190 million <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually <a href="galactic%20merger">merge</a> to form a large <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a>. The radio source <a href="3C%20326">3C 326</a> was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.

A much larger galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 <a href="Abell%202063">Abell 2063</a>. The cluster is thought to be interacting with the nearby galaxy group <a href="MKW%203s">MKW 3s</a>, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the <a href="cD%20galaxy">cD galaxy</a> at the center of Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—<a href="NGC%205920">NGC 5920</a>—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star <a href="Pi%20Serpentis">Pi Serpentis</a> lies <a href="AWM%204">AWM 4</a>, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, <a href="NGC%206051">NGC 6051</a>, is a <a href="radio%20galaxy">radio galaxy</a> that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster <a href="Abell%202052">Abell 2052</a> has central cD radio galaxy, <a href="3C%20317">3C 317</a>. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.
Consisting of two quasars with a separation of less than 5 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s, the quasar pair <a href="4C%2011.50">4C 11.50</a> is one of the visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a <a href="gravitational%20lensing">lensed</a> image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is <a href="3C%20321">3C 321</a>. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and are in the process of merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>.

An example of <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>ing is found in the radio galaxy <a href="3C%20324">3C 324</a>. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of "z" = 1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift "z" = 0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a <a href="dust%20lane">dust lane</a> obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the <a href="BL%20Lac%20object">BL Lac object</a> <a href="PG%201553%2B113">PG 1553+113</a> is a heavy emitter of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the <a href="electronvolt">TeV</a> range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others. In 2012, the object flared in the gamma-ray spectrum, tripling in luminosity for two nights, allowing the redshift to be accurately measured as "z" = 0.49.

Several <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a>s (GRBs) have been observed in Serpens Caput, such as <a href="GRB%20970111">GRB 970111</a>, one of the brightest GRBs observed. An optical transient event associated with this GRB has not been found, despite its intensity. The host galaxy initially also proved elusive, however it now appears that the host is a <a href="Seyfert%20galaxy%23Type%20I%20Seyfert%20galaxies">Seyfert I galaxy</a> located at redshift "z" = 0.657. The X-ray afterglow of the GRB has also been much fainter than for other dimmer GRBs. More distant is <a href="GRB%20060526">GRB 060526</a> (redshift "z" = 3.221), from which X-ray and optical afterglows were detected. This GRB was very faint for a long-duration GRB.

Part of the galactic plane passes through the tail, and thus Serpens Cauda is rich in deep-sky objects within our own galaxy. The <a href="Eagle%20Nebula">Eagle Nebula</a> and its associated star cluster, <a href="Messier%2016">Messier 16</a> lie 7,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the galactic center. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the <a href="Pillars%20of%20Creation">Pillars of Creation</a>, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. The stars being born in the Eagle Nebula, added to those with an approximate age of 5 million years have an average temperature of 45,000 <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s and produce prodigious amounts of radiation that will eventually <a href="photoevaporation">destroy</a> the dust pillars. Despite its fame, the Eagle Nebula is fairly dim, with an integrated magnitude of approximately 6.0. The star-forming regions in the nebula are often <a href="evaporating%20gaseous%20globule">evaporating gaseous globule</a>s; unlike <a href="Bok%20globule">Bok globule</a>s they only hold one <a href="protostar">protostar</a>.

North of Messier 16, at a distance of approximately 2000 parsecs, is the <a href="OB%20association">OB association</a> <a href="Serpens%20OB2">Serpens OB2</a>, containing over 100 OB stars. Around 5 million years old, the association appears to still contain star-forming regions, and the light from its stars is illuminating the <a href="HII%20region">HII region</a> <a href="Sh2-54">S 54</a>. Within this HII region is the open cluster <a href="NGC%206604">NGC 6604</a>, which is the same age as the surrounding OB association, and the cluster is now thought to simply be the densest part of it. The cluster appears to be producing a thermal chimney of ionized gas, caused by the interaction of the gas from the <a href="galactic%20disk">galactic disk</a> with the <a href="galactic%20halo">galactic halo</a>.

Another open cluster in Serpens Cauda is <a href="IC%204756">IC 4756</a>, containing at least one naked-eye star, HD 172365 (another naked-eye star in the vicinity, <a href="HD%20171586">HD 171586</a>, is most likely unrelated). Positioned approximately 440 parsecs distant, the cluster is estimated to be around 800 million years old, quite old for an open cluster. Despite the presence of the Milky Way in Serpens Cauda, one globular cluster can be found: <a href="NGC%206535">NGC 6535</a>, although invisible to the naked eye, can be made out in small telescopes just north of Zeta Serpentis. Rather small and sparse for a globular cluster, this cluster contains no known RR Lyrae variables, which is unusual for a globular cluster.

<a href="MWC%20922">MWC 922</a> is a star surrounded by a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>. Dubbed the <a href="Red%20Square%20Nebula">Red Square Nebula</a> due to its similarities to the <a href="Red%20Rectangle%20Nebula">Red Rectangle Nebula</a>, the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions. The nebula contains concentric rings, which are similar to those seen in the supernova <a href="SN%201987A">SN 1987A</a>. MWC 922 itself is an <a href="FS%20Canis%20Majoris%20variable">FS Canis Majoris variable</a>, meaning that it is a Be star containing exceptionally bright <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s as well as select <a href="forbidden%20line">forbidden line</a>s, likely due to the presence of a close binary. East of Xi Serpentis is another planetary nebula, <a href="Abell%2041">Abell 41</a>, containing the binary star <a href="MT%20Serpentis">MT Serpentis</a> at its center. The nebula appears to have a bipolar structure, and the axis of symmetry of the nebula has been found to be within 5° of the line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stars, strengthening the link between binary stars and bipolar planetary nebulae. On the other end of the stellar age spectrum is <a href="L483">L483</a>, a dark nebula which contains the protostar <a href="IRAS%2018418-0440">IRAS 18418-0440</a>. Although classified as a <a href="protostar%23Classes%20of%20Protostars">class 0 protostar</a>, it has some unusual features for such an object, such as a lack of high-velocity <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>s, and it has been proposed that this object is in transition between class 0 and <a href="protostar%23Classes%20of%20Protostars">class I</a>. A <a href="variable%20nebula">variable nebula</a> exists around the protostar, although it is only visible in infrared light.
The <a href="Serpens%20cloud">Serpens cloud</a> is a massive star-forming <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a> situated in the southern part of Serpens Cauda. Only two million years old and 420 parecs distant, the cloud is known to contain many protostars such as <a href="Serpens%20FIRS%201">Serpens FIRS 1</a> and <a href="Serpens%20SVS%2020">Serpens SVS 20</a>. The <a href="Serpens%20south">Serpens South</a> protocluster was uncovered by NASA's <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> in the southern portion of the cloud, and it appears that star formation is still continuing in the region. Another site of star formation is the <a href="Westerhout%2040">Westerhout 40</a> complex, consisting of a prominent HII region adjacent to a molecular cloud. Located around 500 parsecs distant, it is one of the nearest massive regions of star formation, but as the molecular cloud obscures the HII region, rendering it and its embedded cluster tough to see visibly, it is not as well-studied as others. The embedded cluster likely contains over 600 stars above 0.1 solar masses, with several massive stars, including at least one O-type star, being responsible for lighting the HII region and the production of a <a href="stellar-wind%20bubble">bubble</a>.

Despite the presence of the Milky Way, several active galaxies are visible in Serpens Cauda as well, such as <a href="PDS%20456">PDS 456</a>, found near Xi Serpentis. The most intrinsically luminous nearby active galaxy, this AGN has been found to be extremely variable in the <a href="X-ray%20spectrum">X-ray spectrum</a>. This has allowed light to be shed on the nature of the supermassive black hole at the center, likely a <a href="Kerr%20black%20hole">Kerr black hole</a>. It is possible that the quasar is undergoing a transition from an ultraluminous infrared galaxy to a classical radio-quiet quasar, but there are problems with this theory, and the object appears to be an exceptional object that does not completely lie within current classification systems. Nearby is <a href="NRAO%20530">NRAO 530</a>, a <a href="blazar">blazar</a> that has been known to flare in the X-rays occasionally. One of these flares was for less than 2000 seconds, making it the shortest flare ever observed in a blazar as of 2004. The blazar also appears to show periodic variability in its <a href="radio%20wave">radio wave</a> output over two different periods of six and ten years.

There are two daytime <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s that <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiate</a> from Serpens, the <a href="Omega%20Serpentids">Omega Serpentids</a> and the <a href="Sigma%20Serpentids">Sigma Serpentids</a>. Both showers peak between December 18 and December 25.

Steve Biko

Bantu Stephen Biko (18 December 1946 – 12 September 1977) was a South African <a href="internal%20resistance%20to%20apartheid">anti-apartheid</a> activist. Ideologically an <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalist</a> and <a href="African%20socialism">African socialist</a>, he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the <a href="Black%20Consciousness%20Movement">Black Consciousness Movement</a> during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym Frank Talk.
Raised in a poor <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> family, Biko grew up in <a href="Ginsberg%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Ginsberg township</a> in the <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a>. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the <a href="University%20of%20Natal">University of Natal</a>, where he joined the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20South%20African%20Students">National Union of South African Students</a> (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> system of <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> and <a href="White%20South%20African">white-minority</a> rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white <a href="liberalism">liberals</a>, rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that even when well-intentioned, white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a <a href="paternalism">paternalistic</a> manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the <a href="South%20African%20Students%27%20Organisation">South African Students' Organisation</a> (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to "<a href="Black%20people">blacks</a>", a term that Biko used in reference not just to <a href="Bantu%20peoples%20in%20South%20Africa">Bantu-speaking Africans</a> but also to <a href="Coloureds">Coloureds</a> and <a href="Indian%20South%20Africans">Indians</a>. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had various white friends and lovers. The white-minority <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a> government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.
Influenced by <a href="Frantz%20Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a> and the African-American <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black Power movement</a>, Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> and a socialist economy. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan "<a href="black%20is%20beautiful">black is beautiful</a>". In 1972, he was involved in founding the <a href="Black%20People%27s%20Convention">Black People's Convention</a> (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a <a href="banning%20order">banning order</a> in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a crèche in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was severely beaten by state security officers, resulting in his death. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.
Biko's fame spread posthumously. He became the subject of numerous songs and works of art, while a 1978 biography by his friend <a href="Donald%20Woods">Donald Woods</a> formed the basis for the 1987 film "<a href="Cry%20Freedom">Cry Freedom</a>". During Biko's life, the government alleged that he hated whites, various anti-apartheid activists accused him of <a href="sexism">sexism</a>, and African racial nationalists criticised his united front with Coloureds and Indians. Nonetheless, Biko became one of the earliest icons of the movement against apartheid, and is regarded as a political <a href="martyr%20%28politics%29">martyr</a> and the "Father of Black Consciousness". His political legacy remains a matter of contention.

Bantu Stephen Biko was born on 18 December 1946, at his grandmother's house in <a href="Tarkastad">Tarkastad</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a>. The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko, he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile. His parents had married in <a href="Whittlesea%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Whittlesea</a>, where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was transferred to <a href="Queenstown%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Queenstown</a>, <a href="Port%20Elizabeth">Port Elizabeth</a>, <a href="Fort%20Cox%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Fort Cox</a>, and finally <a href="King%20William%27s%20Town">King William's Town</a>, where he and Alice settled in <a href="Ginsberg%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Ginsberg township</a>. This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet. Both <a href="Bantu%20peoples%20in%20South%20Africa">Bantu African</a> and <a href="Coloureds">Coloured</a> people lived in the <a href="township%20%28South%20Africa%29">township</a>, where <a href="Xhosa%20language">Xhosa</a>, <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, and English were all spoken. After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office, while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Africa">University of South Africa</a>. Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at <a href="Grey%20Hospital">Grey Hospital</a> in King William's Town. According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.

Biko's given name "Bantu" means "people"; Biko interpreted this in terms of the saying ""Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu"" ("a person is a person by means of other people"). As a child he was nicknamed "Goofy" and "Xwaku-Xwaku", the latter a reference to his unkempt appearance. He was raised in his family's <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Southern%20Africa">Anglican</a> Christian faith. In 1950, when Biko was four, his father fell ill, was hospitalised in <a href="St.%20Matthew%27s%20Hospital">St. Matthew's Hospital</a>, <a href="Keiskammahoek">Keiskammahoek</a>, and died, making the family dependent on his mother's income.

Biko spent two years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg. Regarded as a particularly intelligent pupil, he was allowed to <a href="grade%20skipping">skip a year</a>. In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township. Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams. In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother Khaya as a student at <a href="Lovedale%20%28South%20Africa%29">Lovedale</a>, a prestigious <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in <a href="Alice%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Alice, Eastern Cape</a>. Within three months of Steve's arrival, Khaya was accused of having connections to <a href="Poqo">Poqo</a>, the armed wing of the <a href="Pan%20Africanist%20Congress%20of%20Azania">Pan Africanist Congress</a> (PAC), an <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalist</a> group which the government had banned. Both Khaya and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal. No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale. Commenting later on this situation, he stated: "I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at anything else. I hated authority like hell."

From 1964 to 1965, Biko studied at St. Francis College, a <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20South%20Africa">Catholic</a> boarding school in <a href="Mariannhill">Mariannhill</a>, <a href="Natal%20Province">Natal</a>. The college had a <a href="liberalism">liberal</a> political culture, and Biko developed his political consciousness there. He became particularly interested in the replacement of South Africa's <a href="dominant%20minority">white minority</a> <a href="South%20Africa%23Republic">colonial government</a> with an administration that represented the country's black majority. Among the <a href="anti-colonialism">anti-colonialist</a> leaders who became Biko's heroes at this time were Algeria's <a href="Ahmed%20Ben%20Bella">Ahmed Ben Bella</a> and Kenya's <a href="Jaramogi%20Oginga%20Odinga">Jaramogi Oginga Odinga</a>. He later said that most of the "politicos" in his family were sympathetic to the PAC, which had <a href="anti-communism">anti-communist</a> and African racialist ideas. Biko admired what he described as the PAC's "terribly good organisation" and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government. In December 1964, he travelled to <a href="Zwelitsha">Zwelitsha</a> for the <a href="ulwaluko">ulwaluko</a> <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.

Biko was initially interested in studying law at university, but many of those around him discouraged this, believing that law was too closely intertwined with political activism. Instead they convinced him to choose medicine, a subject thought to have better career prospects. He secured a scholarship, and in 1966 entered the "non-European" section of the <a href="University%20of%20Natal">University of Natal</a> Medical School in <a href="Wentworth%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal">Wentworth</a>, a township of <a href="Durban">Durban</a>. There, he joined what his biographer Xolela Mangcu called "a peculiarly sophisticated and cosmopolitan group of students" from across South Africa; many of them later held prominent roles in the post-apartheid era. The late 1960s was the heyday of radical student politics across the world, as reflected in the <a href="protests%20of%201968">protests of 1968</a>, and Biko was eager to involve himself in this environment. Soon after he arrived at the university, he was elected to the Students' Representative Council (SRC).

The university's SRC was affiliated with the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20South%20African%20Students">National Union of South African Students</a> (NUSAS). NUSAS had taken pains to cultivate a multi-racial membership but remained white-dominated because the majority of South Africa's students were from the country's white minority. As Clive Nettleton, a white NUSAS leader, put it: "the essence of the matter is that NUSAS was founded on white initiative, is financed by white money and reflects the opinions of the majority of its members who are white". NUSAS officially opposed apartheid, but it moderated its opposition in order to maintain the support of conservative white students. Biko and several other black African NUSAS members were frustrated when it organised parties in white dormitories, which black Africans were forbidden to enter. In July 1967, a NUSAS conference was held at <a href="Rhodes%20University">Rhodes University</a> in <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a>; after the students arrived, they found that dormitory accommodation had been arranged for the white and <a href="Indian%20South%20Africans">Indian</a> delegates but not the black Africans, who were told that they could sleep in a local church. Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger. Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism:

I realized that for a long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion ... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea ... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.

Following the 1968 NUSAS conference in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, many of its members attended a July 1968 conference of the <a href="World%20Student%20Christian%20Federation">University Christian Movement</a> at <a href="Stutterheim">Stutterheim</a>. There, the black African members decided to hold a December conference to discuss the formation of an independent black student group. The <a href="South%20African%20Students%27%20Organisation">South African Students' Organisation</a> (SASO) was officially launched at a July 1969 conference at the <a href="University%20of%20Limpopo">University of the North</a>; there, the group's constitution and basic policy platform were adopted. The group's focus was on the need for contact between centres of black student activity, including through sport, cultural activities, and debating competitions. Though Biko played a substantial role in SASO's creation, he sought a low public profile during its early stages, believing that this would strengthen its second level of leadership, such as his ally <a href="Barney%20Pityana">Barney Pityana</a>. Nonetheless, he was elected as SASO's first president; <a href="Pat%20Matshaka">Pat Matshaka</a> was elected vice president and <a href="Wuila%20Mashalaba">Wuila Mashalaba</a> elected secretary. Durban became its "de facto" headquarters.

Biko developed SASO's ideology of "Black Consciousness" in conversation with other black student leaders. A SASO policy manifesto produced in July 1971 defined this ideology as "an attitude of mind, a way of life. The basic tenet of Black Consciousness is that the Blackman must reject all value systems that seek to make him a foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity." Black Consciousness centred on psychological empowerment, through combating the feelings of inferiority that most black South Africans exhibited. Biko believed that, as part of the struggle against apartheid and white-minority rule, blacks should affirm their own humanity by regarding themselves as worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. It applied the term "<a href="black%20people">black</a>" not only to Bantu-speaking Africans, but also to Indians and Coloureds. SASO adopted this term over "non-white" because its leadership felt that defining themselves in opposition to white people was not a positive self-description. Biko promoted the slogan "<a href="black%20is%20beautiful">black is beautiful</a>", explaining that this meant "Man, you are okay as you are. Begin to look upon yourself as a human being."

Biko presented a paper on "White Racism and Black Consciousness" at an <a href="academic%20conference">academic conference</a> in the <a href="University%20of%20Cape%20Town">University of Cape Town</a>'s <a href="Abe%20Bailey%20Centre">Abe Bailey Centre</a> in January 1971. He also expanded on his ideas in a column written for the "SASO Newsletter" under the pseudonym "Frank Talk". His tenure as president was taken up largely by fundraising activities, and involved travelling around various campuses in South Africa to recruit students and deepen the movement's ideological base. Some of these students censured him for abandoning NUSAS' multi-racial approach; others disapproved of SASO's decision to allow Indian and Coloured students to be members. Biko stepped down from the presidency after a year, insisting that it was necessary for a new leadership to emerge and thus avoid any <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> forming around him.

SASO decided after a debate to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would nevertheless recognise the larger organisation as the national student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's growth on various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves to the idea of a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.

The early focus of the <a href="Black%20Consciousness%20Movement">Black Consciousness Movement</a> (BCM) was on criticising anti-racist white liberals and <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> itself, accusing it of <a href="paternalism">paternalism</a> and being a "negative influence" on black Africans. In one of his first published articles, Biko stated that although he was "not sneering at the [white] liberals and their involvement" in the anti-apartheid movement, "one has to come to the painful conclusion that the [white] liberal is in fact appeasing his own conscience, or at best is eager to demonstrate his identification with the black people only insofar as it does not sever all ties with his relatives on his side of the colour line."

Biko and SASO were openly critical of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought to influence the white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures in response to the expulsion of SASO member <a href="Abram%20Onkgopotse%20Tiro">Abram Onkgopotse Tiro</a> from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.

In Durban, Biko entered a relationship with a nurse, Nontsikelelo "Ntsiki" Mashalaba; they married at the King William's Town magistrates court in December 1970. Their first child, Nkosinathi, was born in 1971. Biko initially did well in his university studies, but his grades declined as he devoted increasing time to political activism. Six years after starting his degree, he found himself repeating his third year. In 1972, as a result of his poor academic performance, the University of Natal barred him from further study.

In August 1971, Biko attended a conference on "The Development of the African Community" in <a href="Edendale%2C%20KwaZulu-Natal">Edendale</a>. There, a resolution was presented calling for the formation of the <a href="Black%20People%27s%20Convention">Black People's Convention</a> (BPC), a vehicle for the promotion of Black Consciousness among the wider population. Biko voted in favour of the group's creation but expressed reservations about the lack of consultation with South Africa's Coloureds or Indians. A. Mayatula became the BPC's first president; Biko did not stand for any leadership positions. The group was formally launched in July 1972 in <a href="Pietermaritzburg">Pietermaritzburg</a>. By 1973, it had 41 branches and 4000 members, sharing much of its membership with SASO.

While the BPC was primarily political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) to focus on improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the <a href="Christian%20Institute%20of%20Southern%20Africa">Christian Institute of Southern Africa</a> and the <a href="South%20African%20Council%20of%20Churches">South African Council of Churches</a>. Additional funds came from the <a href="Anglo%20American%20plc">Anglo-American Corporation</a>, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and <a href="Bokwe%20Mafuna">Bokwe Mafuna</a>, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited <a href="Kimberley%2C%20Northern%20Cape">Kimberley</a>, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist <a href="Robert%20Sobukwe">Robert Sobukwe</a>.

Biko's banning order in 1973 prevented him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped to set up a new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, <a href="David%20Russell%20%28bishop%29">David Russell</a>. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was part of the process of infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.

Biko endorsed the unification of South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, he reached out to leading members of the ANC, PAC, and <a href="Unity%20Movement%20%28South%20Africa%29">Unity Movement</a>. His communications with the ANC were largely via <a href="Griffiths%20Mxenge">Griffiths Mxenge</a>, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet <a href="Oliver%20Tambo">Oliver Tambo</a>, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via <a href="Fikile%20Bam">Fikile Bam</a>.

By 1973, the government regarded Black Consciousness as a threat. It sought to disrupt Biko's activities, and in March 1973 placed a <a href="banning%20order">banning order</a> on him. This prevented him from leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited him from speaking either in public or to more than one person at a time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.

In December 1975, attempting to circumvent the restrictions of the banning order, the BPC declared Biko their honorary president. After Biko and other BCM leaders were banned, a new leadership arose, led by <a href="Muntu%20Myeza">Muntu Myeza</a> and <a href="Sathasivian%20Cooper">Sathasivian Cooper</a>, who were considered part of the <a href="Durban%20Moment">Durban Moment</a>. Myeza and Cooper organised a BCM demonstration to mark <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>'s <a href="Mozambican%20War%20of%20Independence">independence from Portuguese colonial rule</a> in 1975. Biko disagreed with this action, correctly predicting that the government would use it to crack down on the BCM. The government arrested around 200 BCM activists, nine of whom were brought before the Supreme Court, accused of subversion by intent. The state claimed that Black Consciousness philosophy was likely to cause "racial confrontation" and therefore threatened public safety. Biko was called as a witness for the defence; he sought to refute the state's accusations by outlining the movement's aims and development. Ultimately, the accused were convicted and imprisoned on <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>.

In 1973, Biko had enrolled for a law degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa. He passed several exams, but had not completed the degree at his time of death. His performance on the course was poor; he was absent from several exams and failed his Practical Afrikaans module. The state security services repeatedly sought to intimidate him; he received anonymous threatening phone calls, and gun shots were fired at his house. A group of young men calling themselves 'The Cubans' began guarding him from these attacks. The security services detained him four times, once for 101 days. With the ban preventing him from gaining employment, the strained economic situation impacted his marriage.

During his ban, Biko asked for a meeting with <a href="Donald%20Woods">Donald Woods</a>, the white liberal editor of the "<a href="Daily%20Dispatch">Daily Dispatch</a>". Under Woods' editorship, the newspaper had published articles criticising apartheid and the white-minority regime and had also given space to the views of various black groups, but not the BCM. Biko hoped to convince Woods to give the movement greater coverage and an outlet for its views. Woods was initially reticent, believing that Biko and the BCM advocated anti-white racism. When he met Biko for the first time, Woods expressed his concern about the anti-white liberal sentiment of Biko's early writings. Biko acknowledged that his earlier "antiliberal" writings were "overkill", but said that he remained committed to the basic message contained within them.

Over the coming years the pair became close friends. Woods later related that, although he continued to have concerns about "the unavoidably racist aspects of Black Consciousness", it was "both a revelation and education" to socialise with blacks who had "psychologically emancipated attitudes". Biko also remained friends with another prominent white liberal, <a href="Duncan%20Innes">Duncan Innes</a>, who served as NUSAS President in 1969; Innes later commented that Biko was "invaluable in helping me to understand black oppression, not only socially and politically, but also psychologically and intellectually". Biko's friendship with these white liberals came under criticism from some members of the BCM.

In 1977, Biko broke his banning order by travelling to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader <a href="Neville%20Alexander">Neville Alexander</a> and deal with growing dissent in the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> branch of the BCM, which was dominated by <a href="Marxism">Marxists</a> like <a href="Johnny%20Issel">Johnny Issel</a>. Biko drove to the city with his friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing that he was being monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police <a href="roadblock">roadblock</a> near <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a>. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.

The security services took Biko to the Walmer police station in Port Elizabeth, where he was held naked in a cell with his legs in <a href="legcuffs">shackles</a>. On 6 September, he was transferred from Walmer to room 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in central Port Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in shackles, and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten by at least one of the ten security police officers. He suffered three <a href="brain%20damage">brain lesion</a>s that resulted in a massive brain <a href="haemorrhage">haemorrhage</a> on 6 September. Following this incident, Biko's captors forced him to remain standing and shackled to the wall. The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and <a href="leg%20irons">leg irons</a>.

Biko was examined by a doctor, Ivor Lang, who stated that there was no evidence of injury on Biko. Later scholarship has suggested Biko's injuries must have been obvious. He was then examined by two other doctors who, after a test showed blood cells to have entered Biko's <a href="spinal%20fluid">spinal fluid</a>, agreed that he should be transported to a prison hospital in Pretoria. On 11 September, police loaded him into the back of a <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>, naked and manacled, and drove him to the hospital. There, Biko died alone in a cell on 12 September 1977. According to an <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a>, an "extensive brain injury" had caused "centralisation of the blood circulation to such an extent that there had been intravasal blood <a href="coagulation">coagulation</a>, acute <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a>, and <a href="uremia">uremia</a>". He was the twenty-first person to die in a South African prison in twelve months, and the forty-sixth political detainee to die during interrogation since the government introduced laws permitting imprisonment without trial in 1963.

News of Biko's death spread quickly across the world, and became symbolic of the abuses of the apartheid system. His death attracted more global attention than he had ever attained during his lifetime. Protest meetings were held in several cities; many were shocked that the security authorities would kill such a prominent dissident leader. Biko's Anglican funeral service, held on 25 September 1977 at King William's Town's Victoria Stadium, took five hours and was attended by around 20,000 people. The vast majority were black, but a few hundred whites also attended, including Biko's friends, such as Russell and Woods, and prominent progressive figures like <a href="Helen%20Suzman">Helen Suzman</a>, <a href="Alex%20Boraine">Alex Boraine</a>, and <a href="Zach%20de%20Beer">Zach de Beer</a>. Foreign diplomats from thirteen nations were present, as was an Anglican delegation headed by Bishop <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>. The event was later described as "the first mass political funeral in the country". Biko's coffin had been decorated with the motifs of a clenched black fist, the African continent, and the statement "One Azania, One Nation"; <a href="Azania">Azania</a> was the name that many activists wanted South Africa to adopt post-apartheid. Biko was buried in the cemetery at Ginsberg. Two BCM-affiliated artists, <a href="Dikob%C3%A9%20Ben%20Martins">Dikobé Ben Martins</a> and <a href="Robin%20Holmes">Robin Holmes</a>, produced a T-shirt marking the event; the design was banned the following year. Martins also created a commemorative poster for the funeral, the first in a tradition of funeral posters that proved popular throughout the 1980s.

Speaking publicly about Biko's death, the country's police minister <a href="Jimmy%20Kruger">Jimmy Kruger</a> initially implied that it had been the result of a <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a>, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them that he would never kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that no one would be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.

Both domestic and international pressure called for a public <a href="inquest">inquest</a> to be held, to which the government agreed. It began in Pretoria's Old Synagogue courthouse in November 1977, and lasted for three weeks. Both the running of the inquest and the quality of evidence submitted came in for extensive criticism. An observer from the <a href="Lawyers%27%20Committee%20for%20Civil%20Rights%20Under%20Law">Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a> stated that the <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a>'s statements were "sometimes redundant, sometimes inconsistent, frequently ambiguous"; <a href="David%20Napley">David Napley</a> described the police investigation of the incident as "perfunctory in the extreme". The security forces alleged that Biko had acted aggressively and had sustained his injuries in a scuffle, in which he had banged his head against the cell wall. The presiding magistrate accepted the security forces' account of events and refused to prosecute any of those involved.

The verdict was treated with scepticism by much of the international media and the US Government led by President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. On 2 February 1978, based on the evidence given at the inquest, the attorney general of the <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a> stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of <a href="South%20African%20rand">R</a>65,000 (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the <a href="South%20African%20Medical%20and%20Dental%20Council">South African Medical and Dental Council</a> initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.

After the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a majority government in 1994, a <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28South%20Africa%29">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> was established to investigate past human-rights abuses. The Commission made plans to investigate Biko's death, but his family petitioned against this on the grounds that the Commission could grant <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a> to those responsible, thereby preventing the family's right to justice and redress. In 1996, the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa">Constitutional Court</a> ruled against the family, allowing the investigation to proceed. Five police officers (<a href="Harold%20Snyman">Harold Snyman</a>, <a href="Gideon%20Nieuwoudt">Gideon Nieuwoudt</a>, Ruben Marx, Daantjie Siebert, and Johan Beneke) appeared before the Commission and requested amnesty in return for information about the events surrounding Biko's death. In December 1998, the Commission refused amnesty to the five men; this was because their accounts were conflicting and thus deemed untruthful, and because Biko's killing had no clear political motive, but seemed to have been motivated by "ill-will or spite". In October 2003, South Africa's justice ministry announced that the five policemen would not be prosecuted because the <a href="statute%20of%20limitations">statute of limitations</a> had elapsed and there was insufficient evidence to secure a prosecution.

The ideas of the Black Consciousness Movement were not developed solely by Biko, but through lengthy discussions with other black students who were rejecting white liberalism. Biko was influenced by his reading of authors like <a href="Frantz%20Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Léopold Sédar Senghor</a>, <a href="James%20Cone">James Cone</a>, and <a href="Paulo%20Freire">Paulo Freire</a>. The Martinique-born Fanon, in particular, has been cited as a profound influence over Biko's ideas about liberation. Biko's biographer Xolela Mangcu cautioned that it would be wrong to reduce Biko's thought to an interpretation of Fanon, and that the impact of "the political and intellectual history of the Eastern Cape" had to be appreciated too. Additional influences on Black Consciousness were the United States-based <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black Power movement</a>, and forms of Christianity like the activist-oriented <a href="black%20theology">black theology</a>.

Biko rejected the apartheid government's division of South Africa's population into tribal and ethnic groups, instead dividing the population into two categories: the white and the black. He defined blackness as a "mental attitude" rather than a "matter of pigmentation", referring to "blacks" as "those who are by law or tradition politically, economically and socially discriminated against as a group in the South African society" and who identify "themselves as a unit in the struggle towards the realization of their aspirations". In this way, he and the Black Consciousness Movement used "black" in reference not only to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians, who together made up almost 90% of South Africa's population in the 1970s. Biko was not a Marxist and believed that it was oppression based on race, rather than class, which would be the main political motivation for change in South Africa. He argued that those on the "white left" often promoted a class-based analysis as a "defence mechanism... primarily because they want to detach us from anything relating to race. In case it has a rebound effect on them because they are white".

Biko saw white racism in South Africa as the totality of the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in opposition to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He nevertheless thought that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.

Biko and his comrades regarded multi-racial anti-apartheid groups as unwittingly replicating the structure of apartheid because they contained whites in dominant positions of control. For this reason, Biko and the others did not participate in these multi-racial organisations. Instead, they called for an anti-apartheid programme that was controlled by black people. Although he called on sympathetic whites to reject any concept that they themselves could be spokespeople for the black majority, Biko nevertheless believed that they had a place in the anti-apartheid struggle, asking them to focus their efforts on convincing the wider white community on the inevitability of apartheid's fall. Biko clarified his position to Woods: "I don't reject liberalism as such or white liberals as such. I reject only the concept that black liberation can be achieved through the leadership of white liberals." He added that "the [white] liberal is no enemy, he's a friend – but for the moment he holds us back, offering a formula too gentle, too inadequate for our struggle".

Biko's approach to activism focused on psychological empowerment, and both he and the BCM saw their main purpose as combating the feeling of inferiority that most black South Africans experienced. Biko expressed dismay at how "the black man has become a shell, a shadow of man ... bearing the yoke of oppression with sheepish timidity", and stated that "the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed". He believed that blacks needed to affirm their own humanity by overcoming their fears and believing themselves worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. He defined Black Consciousness as "an inward-looking process" that would "infuse people with pride and dignity". To promote this, the BCM adopted the slogan "Black is Beautiful".

One of the ways that Biko and the BCM sought to achieve psychological empowerment was through community development. Community projects were seen not only as a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically. They would also help students to learn about the "daily struggles" of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population. Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques. Healthcare was also a priority, with SASO members focusing on primary and preventative care.

Biko opposed any collaboration with the apartheid government, such as the agreements that the Coloured and Indian communities made with the regime. In his view, the <a href="Bantustan">Bantustan</a> system was "the greatest single fraud ever invented by white politicians", stating that it was designed to divide the Bantu-speaking African population along tribal lines. He openly criticised the Zulu leader <a href="Mangosuthu%20Buthelezi">Mangosuthu Buthelezi</a>, stating that the latter's co-operation with the South African government "[diluted] the cause" of black liberation. He believed that those fighting apartheid in South Africa should link with anti-colonial struggles elsewhere in the world and with activists in the global African diaspora combating racial prejudice and discrimination. He also hoped that foreign countries would boycott South Africa's economy.

Biko believed that while apartheid and white-minority rule continued, "sporadic outbursts" of violence against the white minority were inevitable. He wanted to avoid violence, stating that "if at all possible, we want the revolution to be peaceful and reconciliatory". He noted that views on violence differed widely within the BCM—which contained both <a href="pacifism">pacifists</a> and believers in violent revolution—although the group had agreed to operate peacefully, and unlike the PAC and ANC, had no armed wing.

A staunch <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialist</a>, Biko saw the South African situation as a "microcosm" of the broader "black–white power struggle" which manifests as "the global confrontation between the <a href="Third%20World">Third World</a> and the rich white nations of the world". He was suspicious of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s motives in supporting African liberation movements, relating that "Russia is as imperialistic as America", although acknowledged that that "in the eyes of the Third World they have a cleaner slate". He also acknowledged that the material assistance provided by the Soviets was "more valuable" to the anti-apartheid cause than the "speeches and wrist-slapping" provided by Western governments. He was cautious of the possibility of a post-apartheid South Africa getting caught up in the imperialist <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> rivalries of the United States and the Soviet Union.

Biko hoped that a future socialist South Africa could become a completely non-racial society, with people of all ethnic backgrounds living peacefully together in a "joint culture" that combined the best of all communities. He did not support guarantees of minority rights, believing that doing so would continue to recognise divisions along racial lines. Instead he supported a <a href="one%20person%2C%20one%20vote">one person, one vote</a> system. Initially arguing that <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>s were appropriate for Africa, he developed a more positive view of <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>s after conversations with Woods. He saw individual <a href="liberty">liberty</a> as desirable, but regarded it as a lesser priority than access to food, employment, and social security.

Biko was neither a <a href="communism">communist</a> nor <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a>. Described as a proponent of <a href="African%20socialism">African socialism</a>, he called for "a socialist solution that is an authentic expression of black communalism". This idea was derided by some of his Marxist contemporaries, but later found parallels in the ideas of the Mexican <a href="Zapatista%20Army%20of%20National%20Liberation">Zapatistas</a>. Noting that there was significant inequality in the distribution of wealth in South Africa, Biko believed that a <a href="socialism">socialist society</a> was necessary to ensure social justice. In his view, this required a move towards a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> that allowed <a href="private%20enterprise">private enterprise</a> but in which all land was owned by the state and in which state industries played a significant part in forestry, mining, and commerce. He believed that, if post-apartheid South Africa remained capitalist, some black people would join the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> but inequality and poverty would remain. As he put it, if South Africa transitioned to proportional democracy without socialist economic reforms, then "it would not change the position of "economic" oppression of the blacks".

In conversation with Woods, Biko insisted that the BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a "fringe element" may retain "anti-white bitterness"; he added: "we'll do what we can to restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.

Tall and slim in his youth, by his twenties Biko was over six feet tall, with the "bulky build of a heavyweight boxer carrying more weight than when in peak condition", according to Woods. His friends regarded him as "handsome, fearless, a brilliant thinker". Woods saw him as "unusually gifted ... His quick brain, superb articulation of ideas and sheer mental force were highly impressive." According to Biko's friend <a href="Trudi%20Thomas">Trudi Thomas</a>, with Biko "you had a remarkable sense of being in the presence of a great mind". Woods felt that Biko "could enable one to share his vision" with "an economy of words" because "he seemed to communicate ideas through extraverbal media – almost psychically." Biko exhibited what Woods referred to as "a new style of leadership", never proclaiming himself to be a leader and discouraging any <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> from growing up around him. Other activists did regard him as a leader and often deferred to him at meetings. When engaged in conversations, he displayed an interest in listening and often drew out the thoughts of others.

Biko and many others in his activist circle had an antipathy toward luxury items because most South African blacks could not afford them. He owned few clothes and dressed in a low-key manner. He had a large record collection and particularly liked <a href="gumba%20%28music%29">gumba</a>. He enjoyed parties, and according to his biographer Linda Wilson, he often drank substantial quantities of alcohol. Religion did not play a central role in his life. He was often critical of the established Christian churches, but remained a believer in God and found meaning in the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s. Woods described him as "not conventionally religious, although he had genuine religious feeling in broad terms". Mangcu noted that Biko was critical of <a href="Organized%20religion">organised religion</a> and denominationalism and that he was "at best an unconventional Christian".

The Nationalist government portrayed Biko as a hater of whites, but he had several close white friends, and both Woods and Wilson insisted that he was not a racist. Woods related that Biko "simply wasn't a hater of people", and that he did not even hate prominent National Party politicians like <a href="B.%20J.%20Vorster">B. J. Vorster</a> and <a href="Andries%20Treurnicht">Andries Treurnicht</a>, instead hating their ideas. It was rare and uncharacteristic of him to display any rage, and was rare for him to tell people about his doubts and inner misgivings, reserving those for a small number of confidants.

Biko never addressed questions of <a href="gender">gender</a> and <a href="sexism">sexism</a> in his politics. The sexism was evident in many ways, according to <a href="Mamphela%20Ramphele">Mamphela Ramphele</a>, a BCM activist and doctor at the Zanempilo Clinic, including that women tended to be given responsibility for the cleaning and catering at functions. "There was no way you could think of Steve making a cup of tea or whatever for himself", another activist said. <a href="Feminism">Feminism</a> was viewed as irrelevant "bra-burning". Surrounded by women who cared about him, Biko developed a reputation as a <a href="Promiscuity%23Male%20promiscuity">womaniser</a>, something that Woods described as "well earned". He displayed no racial prejudice, sleeping with both black and white women. At NUSAS, he and his friends competed to see who could have sex with the most female delegates. Responding to this behaviour, the NUSAS general secretary <a href="Sheila%20Lapinsky">Sheila Lapinsky</a> accused Biko of sexism, to which he responded: "Don't worry about my sexism. What about your white racist friends in NUSAS?" Sobukwe also admonished Biko for his womanising, believing that it set a bad example to other activists.

Biko married Ntsiki Mashalaba in December 1970. They had two children together: Nkosinathi, born in 1971, and Samora, born in 1975. Biko's wife chose the name Nkosinathi ("The Lord is with us"), and Biko named their second child after the Mozambican revolutionary leader <a href="Samora%20Machel">Samora Machel</a>. Angered by her husband's serial adultery, Mashalaba ultimately moved out of their home, and by the time of his death, she had begun divorce proceedings. Biko had also begun an extra-marital relationship with Mamphela Ramphele. In 1974, she bore him a daughter, Lerato, who died after two months. A son, <a href="Hlumelo%20Biko">Hlumelo</a>, was born to Ramphele in 1978, after Biko's death. Biko was also in a relationship with Lorrain Tabane, who bore him a child named Motlatsi in 1977.

Biko is viewed as the "father" of the Black Consciousness Movement and the anti-apartheid movement's first icon. <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> called him "the spark that lit a veld fire across South Africa", adding that the Nationalist government "had to kill him to prolong the life of apartheid". Opening an anthology of his work in 2008, Manning Marable and Peniel Joseph wrote that his death had "created a vivid symbol of black resistance" to apartheid that "continues to inspire new black activists" over a decade after the transition to majority rule. Johann de Wet, a professor of <a href="communication%20studies">communication studies</a>, described him as "one of South Africa's most gifted political strategists and communicators". In 2004 he was elected 13th in <a href="SABC%203">SABC 3</a>'s <a href="Great%20South%20Africans">Great South Africans</a> public poll.

Although Biko's ideas have not received the same attention as Frantz Fanon's, Ahluwalia and Zegeye wrote in 2001 that the men shared "a highly similar pedigree in their interests in the philosophical psychology of consciousness, their desire for a decolonising of the mind, the liberation of Africa and in the politics of nationalism and socialism for the 'wretched of the earth'". Academics argue that Biko's thought remains relevant; for example, in "<a href="African%20Identities">African Identities</a>" in 2015, Isaac Kamola wrote that Biko's critique of white liberalism was relevant to situations like the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>' <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> and <a href="Invisible%20Children%2C%20Inc.">Invisible Children, Inc.</a>'s "<a href="Kony%202012">KONY 2012</a>" campaign.

Woods held the view that Biko had filled the vacuum within the country's African nationalist movement that arose in the late 1960s following the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela and the banning of Sobukwe. Following Biko's death, the Black Consciousness Movement declined in influence as the ANC emerged as a resurgent force in anti-apartheid politics. This brought about a shift in focus from the BCM's community organising to wider mass mobilisation, including attempts to follow Tambo's call to make South Africa "ungovernable", which involved increasing violence and clashes between rival anti-apartheid groups.

Followers of Biko's ideas re-organised as the <a href="Azanian%20People%27s%20Organisation">Azanian People's Organisation</a> (AZAPO), which subsequently split into the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Azania">Socialist Party of Azania</a> and the <a href="Black%20People%27s%20Convention">Black People's Convention</a>. Several figures associated with the ANC denigrated Biko during the 1980s. For instance, members of the ANC-affiliated <a href="United%20Democratic%20Front%20%28South%20Africa%29">United Democratic Front</a> assembled outside Biko's Ginsberg home shouting "U-Steve Biko, I-CIA!", an allegation that Biko was a spy for the United States' <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). These demonstrations resulted in clashes with Biko supporters from AZAPO.

A year after Biko's death, his "Frank Talk" writings were published as an edited collection, "<a href="I%20Write%20What%20I%20Like">I Write What I Like</a>". The defence that Biko provided for arrested SASO activists was used as the basis for the 1978 book "The Testimony of Steve Biko", edited by Millard Arnold. Woods fled to England that year, where he campaigned against apartheid and further publicised Biko's life and death, writing many newspaper articles about him, as well as a book, "Biko" (1978). This was made into the 1987 film "<a href="Cry%20Freedom">Cry Freedom</a>" by <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>, starring <a href="Denzel%20Washington">Denzel Washington</a> as Biko. Many film critics and Black Consciousness proponents were concerned that the film foregrounded white characters like Woods over Biko himself, but "Cry Freedom" brought Biko's life and activism to a wider audience. The state censors initially permitted its release in South Africa, but after it began screening in the country's cinemas, copies were confiscated by police on the order of Police Commissioner General <a href="Hendrik%20de%20Wit">Hendrik de Wit</a>, who claimed that it would inflame tensions and endanger public safety. The South African government banned many books about Biko, including those of Arnold and Woods.

Biko was commemorated in several artworks after his death. <a href="Gerard%20Sekoto">Gerard Sekoto</a>, a South African artist based in France, produced "Homage to Steve Biko" in 1978, and another South African artist, <a href="Peter%20Stopforth">Peter Stopforth</a>, included a work entitled "The Interrogators" in his 1979 exhibition. A triptych, it depicted the three police officers implicated in Biko's death. Kenya released a commemorative <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> featuring Biko's face.

Biko's death also inspired several songs, including from artists outside South Africa such as <a href="Tom%20Paxton">Tom Paxton</a> and <a href="Peter%20Hammill">Peter Hammill</a>. The English singer-songwriter <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> released "<a href="Biko%20%28song%29">Biko</a>" in tribute to him, which was a hit single in 1980, and was banned in South Africa soon after. Along with other <a href="Music%20in%20the%20movement%20against%20apartheid">anti-apartheid music</a>, the song helped to integrate anti-apartheid themes into Western popular culture. Biko's life was also commemorated through theatre. The inquest into his death was dramatised as a play, "The Biko Inquest", first performed in London in 1978; a 1984 performance was directed by <a href="Albert%20Finney">Albert Finney</a> and broadcast on television. Anti-apartheid activists used Biko's name and memory in their protests; in 1979, a mountaineer climbed the spire of <a href="Grace%20Cathedral%2C%20San%20Francisco">Grace Cathedral</a> in San Francisco to unfurl a banner with the names of Biko and imprisoned <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther Party</a> leader <a href="Geronimo%20Pratt">Geronimo Pratt</a> on it.

Following apartheid's collapse, Woods raised funds to commission a bronze statue of Biko from <a href="Naomi%20Jacobson">Naomi Jacobson</a>. It was erected outside the front door of city hall in <a href="East%20London%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">East London</a> on the Eastern cape, opposite a statue commemorating British soldiers killed in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. Over 10,000 people attended the monument's unveiling in September 1997. In the following months it was vandalised several times; in one instance it was daubed with the letters "AWB", an acronym of the <a href="Afrikaner%20Weerstandsbeweging">Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging</a>, a far-right Afrikaner paramilitary group. In 1997, the cemetery where Biko was buried was renamed the Steve Biko Garden of Remembrance. The <a href="District%20Six%20Museum">District Six Museum</a> also held an exhibition of artwork marking the 20th anniversary of his death by examining his legacy.

Also in September 1997, Biko's family established the <a href="Steve%20Biko%20Foundation">Steve Biko Foundation</a>. The <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> donated money to the group to establish a Steve Biko Centre in Ginsberg, opened in 2012. The Foundation launched its annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture in 2000, each given by a prominent black intellectual. The first speaker was <a href="Njabulo%20Ndebele">Njabulo Ndebele</a>; later speakers included <a href="Zakes%20Mda">Zakes Mda</a>, <a href="Chinua%20Achebe">Chinua Achebe</a>, <a href="Ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9%20wa%20Thiong%27o">Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o</a>, and Mandela.

Buildings, institutes and public spaces around the world have been named after Biko, such as the Steve Bikoplein in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. In 2008, the Pretoria Academic Hospital was renamed the <a href="Steve%20Biko%20Hospital">Steve Biko Hospital</a>. The <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a> has a Steve Biko Centre for Bioethics. In <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador, Bahia</a>, a Steve Biko Institute was established to promote educational attainment among poor <a href="Afro-Brazilians">Afro-Brazilians</a>. In 2012, the <a href="Google%20Cultural%20Institute">Google Cultural Institute</a> published an online archive containing documents and photographs owned by the Steve Biko Foundation. On 18 December 2016, <a href="Google">Google</a> marked what would have been Biko's 70th birthday with a <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a>.

Amid the dismantling of apartheid in the early 1990s, various political parties competed over Biko's legacy, with several saying they were the party that Biko would support if he were still alive. AZAPO in particular claimed exclusive ownership over Black Consciousness. In 1994, the ANC issued a campaign poster suggesting that Biko had been a member of their party, which was untrue. Following the end of apartheid when the ANC formed the government, they were accused of appropriating his legacy. In 2002, AZAPO issued a statement declaring that "Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon" and that the ANC was "scandalously" using Biko's image to legitimise their "weak" government. Members of the ANC have also criticised AZAPO's attitude to Biko; in 1997, Mandela said that "Biko belongs to us all, not just AZAPO." On the anniversary of Biko's death in 2015, delegations from both the ANC and the <a href="Economic%20Freedom%20Fighters">Economic Freedom Fighters</a> independently visited his grave. In March 2017, the South African President <a href="Jacob%20Zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> laid a wreath at Biko's grave to mark <a href="Human%20Rights%20Day">Human Rights Day</a>.

Starship Troopers

Starship Troopers is a <a href="military%20science%20fiction">military science fiction</a> novel by American writer <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. Written in a few weeks in reaction to the U.S. <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20and%20the%20United%20States">suspending nuclear tests</a>, the story was first published as a two-part serial in "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by <a href="G.%20P.%20Putnam%27s%20Sons">G. P. Putnam's Sons</a> in December 1959.

The story is set in a future society ruled by a <a href="world%20government">world government</a> dominated by a military elite, referred to as the <a href="Terran%20Federation%20%28Starship%20Troopers%29">"Terran Federation"</a>. The <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrative</a> follows <a href="Juan%20Rico">Juan "Johnny" Rico</a> through his military service in the <a href="Mobile%20Infantry%20%28Starship%20Troopers%29">Mobile Infantry</a>. Rico progresses from recruit to <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as "Arachnids" or "<a href="Bug%20%28Starship%20Troopers%29">Bugs</a>". Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a>, <a href="civic%20virtue">civic virtue</a>, <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">juvenile delinquency</a>, and <a href="war">war</a>; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein's own political views. "Starship Troopers" has been identified with a tradition of <a href="militarism">militarism</a> in U.S. science fiction, and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. A <a href="Coming%20of%20age">coming-of-age</a> novel, "Starship Troopers" also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s, argues that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and advocates <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal</a> and <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>.

"Starship Troopers" brought to an end <a href="Heinlein%20juveniles">Heinlein's series of juvenile novels</a>. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a> in 1960, and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> and likened to <a href="military%20recruitment">recruitment</a>. The ideology of militarism and the fact that only military veterans had the right to vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as <a href="Fascism">fascist</a>. Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to <a href="racial%20epithets">racial epithets</a>.

Despite the controversy, "Starship Troopers" had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. <a href="Ken%20MacLeod">Ken MacLeod</a> stated that "the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein". Science fiction critic <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a> wrote that "Starship Troopers" is the "ancestral text of U.S. science fiction militarism" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years. The novel has been credited with popularizing the idea of <a href="Powered%20exoskeleton">powered armor</a>, which has since become a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research. Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential. Later science fiction books such as <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s anti-war novel "<a href="The%20Forever%20War">The Forever War</a>" have been described as reactions to "Starship Troopers". The story has been adapted several times, including in a <a href="Starship%20Troopers%20%28film%29">1997 film version</a> directed by <a href="Paul%20Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a> that sought to satirize what the director saw as the fascist aspects of the novel.

Robert Heinlein was among the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s, along with <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>; they were known as the "big three" that dominated U.S. science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era in his writing. Heinlein served in the U.S. Navy for five years after graduating from the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction. At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become "<a href="Stranger%20in%20a%20Strange%20Land">Stranger in a Strange Land</a>" and wrote "Starship Troopers". His motivation arose partially from his anger at U.S. President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s <a href="Partial%20Nuclear%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">decision to suspend U.S. nuclear tests</a>, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward. Writing in his 1980 volume "<a href="Expanded%20Universe%20%28book%29">Expanded Universe</a>", Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the <a href="National%20Committee%20for%20a%20Sane%20Nuclear%20Policy">National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy</a> on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear weapons testing</a> by the United States sparked his desire to write "Starship Troopers". Heinlein and his wife <a href="Virginia%20Heinlein">Virginia</a> created the "<a href="Who%20Are%20the%20Heirs%20of%20Patrick%20Henry%3F">Patrick Henry League</a>" in an attempt to create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views. 

As was the case with many of Heinlein's books, "Starship Troopers" was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a <a href="Young%20adult%20fiction">juvenile novel</a> for New York publishing house <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner</a>; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.

"<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" first published "Starship Troopers" in October and November 1959 as a two-part <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> titled "Starship Soldier". A senior editor at Putnam's, Peter Israel, purchased the manuscript and approved revisions that made it more marketable to adults. Asked whether it was aimed at children or adults, he said at a sales conference "Let's let the readers decide who likes it." The novel was eventually published by <a href="G.%20P.%20Putnam%27s%20Sons">G. P. Putnam's Sons</a>.

Set approximately 700 years from the present day, the human society in "Starship Troopers" is ruled by the <a href="Terran%20Federation%20%28Starship%20Troopers%29">Terran Federation</a>, a form of <a href="world%20government">world government</a> dominated by a military elite. The society is depicted as affluent, and futuristic technology shown as coexisting with educational methods from the 20th century. The rights of a full citizen, to vote and hold public office, are not universally guaranteed, but must be earned through Federal Service. Those who do not perform this service, which usually takes the form of military service, retain the rights of free speech and assembly, but cannot vote or hold public office. People of either gender above the age of 18 are permitted to enlist. Those who leave before completing their service do not receive the vote. Important government jobs are reserved for military veterans. This structure arose "ad hoc" after the collapse of the "20th century Western democracies", driven in part by an inability to control crime and <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">juvenile delinquency</a>, particularly in North America, and a war between an alliance of the US, the UK and Russia against the "Chinese Hegemony".

Two extraterrestrial civilizations are also depicted. The "Arachnids" or "<a href="Bug%20%28Starship%20Troopers%29">Bugs</a>" are shown as communal beings originating from the planet of <a href="Klendathu">Klendathu</a>. They have multiple castes; workers, soldiers, brains, and queens, similar to <a href="ant">ant</a>s and <a href="termite">termite</a>s. The soldiers are the only ones who fight, and are unable to surrender in battle. The "Skinnies" are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids but more so than human beings. The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At the beginning of the story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training. The Skinnies are initially allies of the Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway through the novel. <a href="Faster-than-light">Faster-than-light</a> travel exists in this future: spacecraft operate under the "Cherenkov drive", and can travel "Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks".

"Starship Troopers" is narrated by the main protagonist Juan "Johnny" Rico, a member of the "Mobile Infantry". It is one of the few Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear narrative structure with a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks are frequently to Rico's History and Moral Philosophy course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society. Rico is depicted as a man of <a href="Filipinos">Filipino ancestry</a>, although there has been disagreement on this matter among fans. He is from a wealthy family, whose members had never served in the army. Rico's ancestry is depicted to be a thing of no consequence; the society he lives in appears to have abandoned racial and gender-based prejudice.

The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette transport "Rodger Young" (named after <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipient <a href="Rodger%20Wilton%20Young">Rodger Wilton Young</a>), serving with the platoon known as "Rasczak's Roughnecks". The platoon carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies. The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One of them, Dizzy Flores, dies while returning to orbit. The narrative then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school. Rico and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father's attitude towards the military. Rico makes his decision after discovering that his classmate Carmen Ibañez also intends to enlist.

Rico's choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a sense of estrangement. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for <a href="Arthur%20Currie">Arthur Currie</a> who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated enough not to resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.

The "Bug War" has changed from border incidents to a full-scale war during Rico's training. An Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> alerts civilians to the situation; Rico's mother is killed in the attack. Rico participates in the Battle of Klendathu, an attack on the Arachnid's home world, which turns into a disastrous defeat for the Terran Federation. Rico's ship, the "Valley Forge", is destroyed, and his unit is decimated; he is reassigned to the Roughnecks on board the "Rodger Young," led by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal. The unit carries out several raids, and Rico is promoted to corporal by Jelal, after Rasczak dies in combat.

One of his comrades in the Roughnecks suggests that Rico go to officer training school and try to become an officer. Rico ends up going to see Jelal, and finds that Jelal already had the paperwork ready. Rico enters <a href="Officer%20Candidate%20School">Officer Candidate School</a> for a second course of training, including further courses in "History and Moral Philosophy". En route from the Roughnecks to the school, Rico encounters his father, who has also enlisted and is now a corporal, and the two reconcile. He is also visited in school by Carmen, now an ensign and ship's pilot officer in the Navy, and the two discuss their friend Carl, who had been killed earlier in the war.

Rico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit. Under the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, his boot camp drill instructor Fleet Sergeant Zim, who was reassigned from Mobile Infantry boot camp (Camp Currie), Rico commands a platoon during "Operation Royalty", a raid to capture members of the Arachnid brain caste and queens. Rico then returns to the officer school to graduate. The novel ends with him holding the rank of Second Lieutenant, in command of his old platoon in the "Rodger Young", with his father as his platoon sergeant. The platoon has been renamed "Rico's Roughnecks", and is about to participate in an attack on Klendathu.

Commentators have written that "Starship Troopers" is not driven by its plot, though it contains scenes of military combat. Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an "ideologically intense" book. A 1997 review in "<a href="Salon%20%28magazine%29">Salon</a>" categorized it as a "<a href="Philosophical%20fiction">philosophical novel</a>". Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. Some contend that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows readers to draw their own conclusions; others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.

"Starship Troopers" has been identified as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society is inevitable and necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it is the heart of the army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that "Starship Troopers" "glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the <a href="Poor%20Bloody%20Infantry">Poor Bloody Infantry</a>, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation – but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored." The story is based on the <a href="Social%20Darwinism">social Darwinist</a> idea of society as a struggle for survival based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.

Heinlein draws an analogy between the human society in the novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be vigilant against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers have suggested that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, patriotism, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the <a href="Frontier%20Thesis">frontier</a>. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of "Starship Troopers", of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.

"Starship Troopers" has been referred to as a "<a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>" or "<a href="coming-of-age">coming-of-age</a>" story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the value of <a href="militarism">militarism</a>, thus inviting the reader to learn it as well. This is especially true of the parts of his training that involve indoctrination, such as the claim by one of his instructors that rule by military veterans is the ideal form of government, because only they understand how to put collective well-being above the individual. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a soldier, while exploring issues of identity and motivation, and traces his overall moral and social development, in a manner identified by commentators as similar to many stories about German soldiers in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar <a href="Howard%20Franklin">Howard Franklin</a>. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is "calculated sadism" but is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side. The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico "crossing the hump" with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development. The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that "moral sense" derives entirely from the will to survive. The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile "wilderness" in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well. Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey "outward" through the novel also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.

"Starship Troopers" also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s, suggesting that it had led young people to be spoiled and undisciplined. These beliefs are expressed through the classroom lectures of Dubois, Rico's teacher for History and Moral Philosophy. Dubois praises <a href="Flagellation">flogging</a> and other types of <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> as a means of addressing juvenile crimes. It has been suggested that Heinlein endorsed this view, although the fact that Dubois also compares raising children to training a puppy has been used to argue that Heinlein was making use of <a href="irony">irony</a>. The story is strongly in favor of corporal punishment and <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>, as a means of correcting <a href="juvenile%20delinquent">juvenile delinquent</a>s, part of a trend in science fiction which examines technology and outer space in an innovative manner, but is reactionary with respect to human relationships. As with other books by Heinlein, traditional schools are denigrated, while learning "on the spot" is extolled: Rico is able to master the things required of him in military training without undue difficulty.

Dubois also ridicules the idea of <a href="Natural%20and%20legal%20rights">inalienable rights</a>, such as "<a href="Life%2C%20Liberty%2C%20and%20the%20Pursuit%20of%20Happiness">Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness</a>", arguing that people only have the rights that they are willing to fight and die for to protect. The novel appeals to scientific authority to justify this position; Dubois repeatedly states that his argument is mathematically demonstrable, statements which have led scholars to label the novel "hard science fiction", despite its social and political themes. The "moral decline" caused by this situation is depicted as having caused a global war between an alliance of the U.S., Britain, and Russia against the "Chinese Hegemony" in the year 1987. Despite the alliance between the U.S. and Russia, this war has been described as demonstrating Heinlein's anti-communist beliefs, which saw "swarming hordes" of Chinese as a bigger threat. The novel draws some comparisons between the Chinese and the Arachnids, and suggests that the lessons of one war could be applied to the other.

To Heinlein's surprise, "Starship Troopers" won the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a> in 1960. It has been acknowledged as one of the best-known and most influential works of science fiction. The novel is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review as one of the ten best genre books of 1959, in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s, and as the best-known example of <a href="military%20science%20fiction">military science fiction</a>. It was also a personal landmark for Heinlein; it was one of his best-selling books, and is his best-known novel. The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a "more mature phase" as an author. Reviewing the book with others written for children, <a href="Floyd%20C.%20Gale">Floyd C. Gale</a> of "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" wrote in 1960 that "Heinlein has penned a juvenile that "really" is not. This is a new and bitter and disillusioned Heinlein". Rating it 2.5 stars out of five for children, 4.5 stars for adults, and "?" for civilians, he believed that the novel would be "of exceptional interest to veterans with battle experience ... but youngsters will find it melancholy and verbose". Conversely, Michael Moorcock described it as Heinlein's last "straight" science fiction, before he turned to more serious writing such as "Stranger in a Strange Land".

By 1980, twenty years after its release, "Starship Troopers" had been translated into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. Heinlein nevertheless complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it was negative and he only heard about it "when someone wants to chew me out". The novel is highly contentious. Controversy surrounded its praise of the military and approval of violence, to the extent that it has frequently been described as <a href="Fascism">fascist</a>, and its implication that militarism is superior to traditional democracy. Heinlein's peers were among those who argued over the book; a comparison between a quote in "Starship Troopers" that "the noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war's desolation" and the anti-war poem "<a href="Dulce%20et%20Decorum%20Est">Dulce et Decorum Est</a>" by <a href="Wilfred%20Owen">Wilfred Owen</a> began a two-year discussion in the "Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies" from 1959 to 1961, with <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>, <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>, <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>, <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, among those debating "Starship Troopers"s quality of writing, philosophy, and morality.

The writing in "Starship Troopers" has received varied responses, with the scenes of military training and combat receiving praise. In a 2009 retrospective, <a href="Jo%20Walton">Jo Walton</a> wrote that "Starship Troopers" was "military SF done extremely well". She went on to argue that "Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [tell the story] '<a href="Ginger%20Rogers">backwards and in high heels</a>' and get away with it." Others referred to it as very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein's descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" praised the "brilliantly written" passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein's "undiminished talent for invention". Scholar <a href="George%20Slusser">George Slusser</a> described the book in 1986 as the "ultimately convincing space-war epic", praising in particular the "precisely imagined" weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the "slickest" of Heinlein's juvenile books.

Criticism of the style of the book has centered on its political aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as "didactic", and the novel was derided for "exposition [that was] inserted in large indigestible chunks". Author <a href="Ken%20MacLeod">Ken MacLeod</a>'s 2003 analysis of the political nature of "Starship Troopers" stated that it was "a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training far outweigh the thin and tensionless combat scenes". Scientist and author Brunner compared it to a "Victorian children's book", while the "Science Fiction Handbook" published in 2009 said that the novel provided "compelling images of a futuristic military" and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Boucher, founder of "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had "forgotten to insert a story". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem "vibrantly appealing".

"Starship Troopers" is generally considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer <a href="Dean%20McLaughlin">Dean McLaughlin</a> called it "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic <a href="Alexei%20Panshin">Alexei Panshin</a> called "Starship Troopers" a militaristic <a href="polemic">polemic</a> and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it "purports to show the life of a typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." Panshin stated that there was no "sustained human conflict" in the book: instead, "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do." Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.

A 1997 review in "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" stated that the novel could almost be described as propaganda, and was terrifying as a result, particularly in its belief that the <a href="Recruit%20training">boot camp</a> had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This was described as a highly unusual utopian vision. Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: "wars are inevitable, [and] that the army is always right". In discussing the book's utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an "unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature". In the words of science fiction scholar <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a>, "Starship Troopers" was an "unsubtle but powerful black-and-white paean to combat life", and an example of <a href="agitprop">agitprop</a> in favor of military values.

Other writers defended Heinlein. George Price argued that "[Heinlein] implies, first, that war is something endured, not enjoyed, and second, that war is so unpleasant, so desolate, that it must at all costs be kept away from one's home." Poul Anderson also defended some of the novel's positions, arguing "Heinlein has recognized the problem of selective versus nonselective franchise, and his proposed solution does merit discussion." Complaints were made against Heinlein for the lack of conscription in "Starship Troopers". When he wrote the novel, the <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">military draft</a> was still in effect in the U.S.

The society within the book has frequently been described as <a href="Fascism">fascist</a>. According to the 2009 "Science Fiction Handbook", it had the effect of giving Heinlein a reputation as a "fanatical warmongering fascist". Scholar Jeffrey Cass has referred to the setting of the book as "unremittingly grim fascism". He has stated that the novel made an analogy between its military conflict and those of the U.S. after World War II, and that it justified <a href="American%20imperialism">U.S. imperialism</a> in the name of fighting another form of imperialism. Jasper Goss has referred to it as "<a href="crypto-fascist">crypto-fascist</a>". Suvin compares Heinlein's suggestion that "all wars arise from population pressure" to the Nazi concept of "<a href="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a>" or "living space" for a superior society that was used to justify territorial expansion.

Some reviewers have suggested that Heinlein was simply discussing the merits of a selective versus a nonselective franchise. Heinlein made a similar claim, over two decades after "Starship Troopers"'s publication, in his "<a href="Expanded%20Universe%20%28book%29">Expanded Universe</a>" and further claimed that 95 percent of "veterans" were not military personnel but members of the civil service. Heinlein's own description has been disputed, even among the book's defenders. Heinlein scholar James Gifford has argued that a number of quotes within the novel suggest that the characters within the book assume that the Federal Service is largely military. For instance, when Rico tells his father that he is interested in Federal Service, his father immediately explains his belief that Federal Service is a bad idea because there is no war in progress, indicating that he sees Federal Service as military in nature. Gifford states that although Heinlein's intentions may have been that Federal Service be 95 percent non-military, in relation to the actual contents of the book, Heinlein "is wrong on this point. Flatly so."

Dennis Showalter, writing in 1975, defended "Starship Troopers", stating that the society depicted in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to <a href="bolshevism">bolshevism</a> and <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument is based on a literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, "Starship Troopers" being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as "<a href="Stranger%20in%20a%20Strange%20Land">Stranger in a Strange Land</a>" (1961) and "<a href="The%20Moon%20is%20a%20Harsh%20Mistress">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a>" (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.

The setting of the book has been described as <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n, but it is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that "Starship Troopers" depicts a world that is "hell for human beings", but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that human nature is to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside the military are not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.

Writers such as Robert A. W. Lowndes, Farmer, and <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a> have criticized the novel for being a hypothetical <a href="utopia">utopia</a>, in the sense that while Heinlein's ideas sound plausible, they have never been put to the test. Moorcock wrote an essay entitled "Starship Stormtroopers" in which he attacked Heinlein and other writers over similar "Utopian fiction". Lowndes accused Heinlein of using <a href="straw%20man">straw man</a> arguments, "countering ingenuous half-truths with brilliant half-truths". Lowndes further argued that the Terran Federation could never be as idealistic as Heinlein portrays it to be because he never properly addressed "whether or not [non-citizens] have at least as full a measure of civil redress against official injustice as we have today". Farmer agreed, arguing that a "world ruled by veterans would be as mismanaged, graft-ridden, and insane as one ruled by men who had never gotten near the odor of blood and guts".

Authors and commentators have stated that the manner in which the extraterrestrial beings are portrayed in "Starship Troopers" has <a href="Racism">racist</a> aspects, arguing that the nicknames "Bugs" and "Skinnies" carry racial overtones. John Brunner compared them to calling Koreans "<a href="gook">gook</a>s". Slusser argued that the term "Bugs" was an "abusive and biologically inaccurate" word that justified the violence against alien beings, a tendency which, according to Slusser, the book shared with other commercially successful science fiction.

Some of Heinlein's other works have also been described as racist, though Franklin argues that this was not unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the U.S. government of the time. Heinlein's early novel "<a href="Sixth%20Column">Sixth Column</a>" was called a "racist paean" to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the <a href="Yellow%20Peril">Yellow Peril</a>. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that "Starship Troopers" "set the pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic" stories. Robert Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein's belief that man is a wild animal. According to this theory, if man lacks a <a href="moral%20compass">moral compass</a> beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.

The fact that all pilots in the novel are women (in contrast to the infantry, which is entirely male) has been cited as evidence of progressive gender politics within the story, although the idea expressed by Rico that women are the motivation for men to fight in the military is a counter-example to this. A 1996 science fiction encyclopedia said that like much of Heinlein's fiction, "Starship Troopers" exemplified "macho male culture". The prosthetically enhanced soldiers in the novel, all of whom are men, have been described as an example of the "hyper-masculinity" brought on by the proximity of these men to technology. The story portrays the Arachnids as so alien that the only response to them can be war. Feminist scholars have described this reaction as a "conventionally masculinist" one. Steffen Hantke has described the mechanized suits in the novel, which make the wearer resemble a "steel gorilla," as defining masculinity as "something intensely physical, based on animal power, instinct, and aggression". He calls this form of masculinity "all body, so to speak, and no brain". Thus, in Hantke's reading, "Starship Troopers" expresses fears of how masculinity may be preserved in an environment of high technology. This fear is exacerbated by the motifs of pregnancy and birth that Heinlein uses when describing how the soldiers in suits are dropped from spaceships, which are always piloted by women. Though Rico says he finds women "marvelous", he shows no desire for sexual activity; the war seems to have subsumed sex in this respect. A 1979 summary argued that despite the gestures towards women's equality, women in the story were still objects, to be protected, and to fight wars over.

Heinlein's books, and "Starship Troopers" in particular, had an enormous impact on political science fiction, to the extent that author <a href="Ken%20MacLeod">Ken MacLeod</a> has stated that "the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein," although many participants in this dialogue disagree with Heinlein. Science fiction critic <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a> states that "Starship Troopers" is the "ancestral text of U.S. <a href="military%20science%20fiction">science fiction militarism</a>" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.

As well as his political views, Heinlein's ideas about a futuristic military as depicted in the novel were deeply influential among films, books, and television shows in later years. Roger Beaumont has suggested that "Starship Troopers" may some day be considered a manual for extraterrestrial warfare. Suvin refers to Juan Rico as the "archetypal Space Soldier". "Starship Troopers" included concepts in military engineering which have since been widely used in other fiction, and which have occasionally been paralleled by scientific research. The novel has been cited as the source of the idea of <a href="powered%20armor">powered armor</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s, which Heinlein describes in great detail. Such suits became a staple of military science fiction.

"Starship Troopers" had a direct influence on many later science fiction stories. <a href="John%20Steakley">John Steakley</a>'s 1984 novel "<a href="Armor%20%28novel%29">Armor</a>" was, according to the author, born out of frustration with the small amount of actual combat in "Starship Troopers" and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 <a href="Gainax">Gainax</a> <a href="Original%20video%20animation">OVA series</a> "<a href="Gunbuster">Gunbuster</a>" has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in "<a href="Ender%27s%20Game">Ender's Game</a>", by <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a>, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in "Ender's Game" to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of <a href="Ender%20Wiggin">Ender Wiggin</a> takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.

Conversely, <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s 1974 anti-war, <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo</a>- and <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula</a>-winning science fiction novel "<a href="The%20Forever%20War">The Forever War</a>" is popularly thought to be a direct reply to "Starship Troopers", and though Haldeman has stated that it is actually a result of his personal experiences in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, he has admitted to being influenced by "Starship Troopers". Haldeman said that he disagreed with "Starship Troopers" because it "glorifies war", but added that "it's a very well-crafted novel, and I believe Heinlein was honest with it". "The Forever War" contains several parallels to "Starship Troopers", including its setting. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein's novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. "The Forever War" does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real world context of the Vietnam War.

Haldeman received a letter from Heinlein, congratulating him on his Nebula Award, which "meant more than the award itself". According to author <a href="Spider%20Robinson">Spider Robinson</a>, Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book "may be the best future war story I've ever read!"

<a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>'s 1965 novel "<a href="Bill%2C%20the%20Galactic%20Hero">Bill, the Galactic Hero</a>" has also been described as a reaction to "Starship Troopers", while <a href="Gordon%20R.%20Dickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a>'s 1961 novel "<a href="Naked%20to%20the%20Stars">Naked to the Stars</a>" has been called "an obvious rejoinder" to "Starship Troopers". "<a href="Ring%20of%20Swords">Ring of Swords</a>", written by Eleanor Arnason in 1993, also depicts a war between two highly aggressive species, of which humans are one. The story deliberately inverts several aspects of "Starship Troopers"; the story is told from the point of view of diplomats seeking to prevent war, rather than soldiers fighting it; and the conflict is the result of the two species being extremely similar, rather than different.

The film rights to the novel were licensed in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled "Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine", and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to "Starship Troopers". The film was directed by <a href="Paul%20Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a>, (who found the book too boring to finish) and released in 1997. The screenplay, by <a href="Edward%20Neumeier">Ed Neumeier</a>, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to sex. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.

The film utilized fascist imagery throughout, including portraying the Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those worn by the <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a>, the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the film—an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry—was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in <a href="Leni%20Riefenstahl">Leni Riefenstahl</a>'s "<a href="Triumph%20of%20the%20Will">Triumph of the Will</a>" (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the <a href="Reich%20Labour%20Service">Reichsarbeitsdienst</a>. Other references to Nazism include the <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue (""Violence is the supreme authority!""). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected his own experience in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II.

The film reignited the debate over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of creating a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be <a href="irony">ironic</a>, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the <a href="jingoism">jingoism</a> of U.S. foreign policy, the <a href="military%20industrial%20complex">military industrial complex</a>, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.

Four sequels, "" (2004), "" (2008), "" (2012) and "" (2017) were released as straight-to-DVD films respectively. In December 2011, <a href="Neal%20H.%20Moritz">Neal H. Moritz</a>, producer of films such as <a href="The%20Fast%20and%20the%20Furious%20%28film%20series%29">"The Fast and the Furious" series</a> and "<a href="I%20Am%20Legend%20%28film%29">I Am Legend</a>", announced plans for a <a href="remake">remake</a> of the film that he claims will be more faithful to the source material. In 2016 <a href="Mark%20Swift">Mark Swift</a> and <a href="Damian%20Shannon">Damian Shannon</a> were reported to be writing the film.

Springbok

The springbok (; "Antidorcas marsupialis") is a medium-sized <a href="antelope">antelope</a> found mainly in southern and southwestern Africa. The sole member of the <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">genus</a> "Antidorcas", this <a href="bovid">bovid</a> was first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by the German zoologist <a href="Eberhard%20August%20Wilhelm%20von%20Zimmermann">Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann</a> in 1780. Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are identified. A slender, long-legged antelope, the springbok reaches at the shoulder and weighs between . Both sexes have a pair of black, long <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a>s that curve backwards. The springbok is characterised by a white face, a dark stripe running from the eyes to the mouth, a light-brown <a href="coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> marked by a reddish-brown stripe that runs from the upper fore leg to the buttocks across the flanks like the <a href="Thomson%27s%20gazelle">Thomson's gazelle</a>, and a white <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">rump</a> flap.

Active mainly at dawn and dusk, springbok form <a href="harem%20%28zoology%29">harem</a>s (mixed-sex herds). In earlier times, springbok of the <a href="Kalahari%20desert">Kalahari desert</a> and <a href="Karoo">Karoo</a> migrated in large numbers across the countryside, a practice known as "trekbokken". A feature unique to the springbok is <a href="pronking">pronking</a>, in which the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air, up to above the ground, in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. Primarily a browser, the springbok feeds on shrubs and <a href="succulent%20plant">succulent</a>s; this antelope can live without drinking water for years, meeting its requirements through eating succulent vegetation. Breeding takes place year-round, and peaks in the rainy season, when forage is most abundant. A single calf is born after a five- to six-month-long pregnancy; weaning occurs at nearly six months of age, and the calf leaves its mother a few months later.

Springbok inhabit the dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. The <a href="IUCN">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> classifies the springbok as a <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> species. No major threats to the long-term survival of the species are known; the springbok, in fact, is one of the few antelope species considered to have an expanding population. They are popular game animals, and are valued for their meat and skin. The springbok is the national animal of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

The common name "springbok" comes from the <a href="Afrikaans%20Language">Afrikaans</a> words "spring" ("jump") and "bok" ("<a href="antelope">antelope</a>" or "<a href="goat">goat</a>"); the first recorded use of the name dates to 1775. The <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a> of the springbok is "Antidorcas marsupialis"; "anti" is <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> for "opposite", and "dorcas" for "<a href="gazelle">gazelle</a>" – identifying that the animal is not a gazelle. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "marsupialis" comes from the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> "marsupium" ("pocket"); it refers to a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the midline of the back from the tail. In fact, this physical feature distinguishes the springbok from true gazelles.

The springbok is the sole member of the <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">genus</a> "Antidorcas" and is placed in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. It was first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by the German zoologist <a href="Eberhard%20August%20Wilhelm%20von%20Zimmermann">Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann</a> in 1780. Zimmermann assigned the genus "Antilope" (<a href="blackbuck">blackbuck</a>) to the springbok. In 1845, Swedish zoologist <a href="Carl%20Jakob%20Sundevall">Carl Jakob Sundevall</a> placed the springbok in "Antidorcas", a genus of its own.

In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>) and colleagues undertook a revision of the <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> of the <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Antilopini">Antilopini</a> on the basis of <a href="Nucleus%20%28biology%29">nuclear</a> and <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l data. They showed that the springbok and the <a href="gerenuk">gerenuk</a> ("Litocranius walleri") form a <a href="clade">clade</a> with <a href="saiga">saiga</a> ("Saiga tatarica") as <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a>. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably different from the rest of the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study even suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below is based on the 2013 study.

Fossil springbok are known from the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>; the antelope appears to have evolved about three million years ago from a gazelle-like ancestor. Three fossil species of "Antidorcas" have been identified, in addition to the extant form, and appear to have been widespread across Africa. Two of these, "A. bondi" and "A. australis", became extinct around 7,000 years ago (early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>). The third species, "A. recki", probably gave rise to the extant form "A. marsupialis" during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, about 100,000 years ago. Fossils have been reported from Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sites in northern, southern, and eastern Africa. Fossils dating back to 80 and 100 thousand years ago have been excavated at <a href="Herolds%20Bay">Herolds Bay Cave</a> (<a href="Western%20Cape%20Province">Western Cape Province</a>, South Africa) and <a href="Florisbad%20archaeological%20and%20paleontological%20site">Florisbad</a> (<a href="Free%20State%20%28province%29">Free State</a>), respectively.

Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised:

The springbok is a slender antelope with long legs and neck. Both sexes reach at the shoulder with a head-and-body length typically between . The weights for both sexes range between . The tail, long, ends in a short, black tuft. Major differences in the size and weight of the subspecies are seen. A study tabulated average body measurements for the three subspecies. "A. m. angolensis" males stand tall at the shoulder, while females are tall. The males weigh around , while the females weigh . "A. m. hofmeyri" is the largest subspecies; males are nearly tall, and the notably shorter females are tall. The males, weighing , are heavier than females, that weigh . However, "A. m. marsupialis" is the smallest subspecies; males are tall and females tall. Average weight of males is , while for females it is . Another study showed a strong correlation between the availability of winter dietary protein and the body mass.

Dark stripes extend across the white face, from the corner of the eyes to the mouth. A dark patch marks the forehead. In juveniles, the stripes and the patch are light brown. The ears, narrow and pointed, measure . Typically light brown, the springbok has a dark reddish-brown band running horizontally from the upper foreleg to the edge of the buttocks, separating the dark back from the white underbelly. The tail (except the terminal black tuft), buttocks, the insides of the legs and the <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">rump</a> are all white. Two other varieties – pure black and pure white <a href="morph%20%28zoology%29">form</a>s – are <a href="Artificial%20selection">artificially selected</a> in some South African ranches. Though born with a deep black sheen, adult black springbok are two shades of chocolate-brown and develop a white marking on the face as they mature. White springbok, as the name suggests, are predominantly white with a light tan stripe on the flanks.
The three subspecies also differ in their colour. "A. m. angolensis" has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the <a href="Muzzle%20%28animal%29">snout</a>. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. "A. m. hofmeyri" is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond the level of the eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. "A. m. marsupialis" is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.

The skin along the middle of the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">dorsal</a> side is folded in, and covered with white hair erected by <a href="arrector%20pili%20muscle">arrector pili muscle</a>s (located between <a href="hair%20follicle">hair follicle</a>s). This white hair is almost fully concealed by the surrounding brown hairs until the fold opens up, and this is a major feature distinguishing this antelope from gazelles. Springbok differ from gazelles in several other ways; for instance, springbok have two <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s on both sides of either jaw, rather than the three observed in gazelles. This gives a total of 28 teeth in the springbok, rather than 32 of gazelles. Other points of difference include a longer, broader, and rigid bridge to the nose and more muscular cheeks in springbok, and differences in the structure of the horns.

Both sexes have black horns, about long, that are straight at the base and then curve backward. In "A. m. marsupialis", females have thinner horns than males; the horns of females are only 60 to 70% as long as those of males. Horns have a girth of at the base; this thins to towards the tip. In the other two subspecies, horns of both sexes are nearly similar. The <a href="Spoor%20%28animal%29">spoor</a>, narrow and sharp, is long.

Springbok are mainly active around dawn and dusk. Activity is influenced by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest in the shade of trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok is similar to that of <a href="Thomson%27s%20gazelle">Thomson's gazelle</a>. Mixed-sex herds or <a href="harem%20%28zoology%29">harem</a>s have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominant</a> males. <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">Territorial</a> males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.

A study of vigilance behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on the borders of herds tend to be more cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.

During the <a href="rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, males establish territories, ranging from , which they <a href="territorial%20marking">mark</a> by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight for access to females, which they do by twisting and levering at each other with their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.

In earlier times, when large populations of springbok roamed the <a href="Kalahari%20desert">Kalahari desert</a> and <a href="Karoo">Karoo</a>, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long that could take several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as "trekbokken" in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. "Trekbokken" is still observed occasionally in <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.

Springbok often go into bouts of repeated high leaps of up to into the air – a practice known as <a href="pronking">pronking</a> (derived from the Afrikaans "pronk", "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking is that it is a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a>. Springbok are very <a href="Fastest%20animals">fast</a> antelopes, clocked at . They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. <a href="Caracal">Caracal</a>s, <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a>s, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s, and <a href="African%20wild%20dog">wild dog</a>s are major predators of the springbok. <a href="Southern%20African%20wildcat">Southern African wildcat</a>s, <a href="black-backed%20jackal">black-backed jackal</a>s, <a href="black%20eagle">black eagle</a>s, <a href="martial%20eagle">martial eagle</a>s, and <a href="tawny%20eagle">tawny eagle</a>s target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.

A 2012 study on the effects of rainfall patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in <a href="Etosha%20National%20Park">Etosha National Park</a> observed that males and juveniles were in better health toward the end of the rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host <a href="helminth">helminth</a>s ("<a href="Haemonchus">Haemonchus</a>", "<a href="Longistrongylus">Longistrongylus</a>" and "<a href="Trichostrongylus">Trichostrongylus</a>"), <a href="ixodid">ixodid</a> <a href="tick">tick</a>s ("<a href="Rhipicephalus">Rhipicephalus</a>" species), lice ("<a href="Damalinia">Damalinia</a>" and "<a href="Linognathus">Linognathus</a>" species). "<a href="Eimeria">Eimeria</a>" species mainly affect juveniles.

Springbok are primarily <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>s and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young <a href="succulent%20plant">succulent</a>s (such as "<a href="Lampranthus">Lampranthus</a>" species) before they <a href="Lignified">lignify</a>. They prefer grasses such as "<a href="Themeda%20triandra">Themeda triandra</a>". Springbok can meet their water needs from the food they eat, and are able to survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.

Springbok mate year-round, though females are more likely to enter <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a> during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to conceive at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's <a href="perineum">perineum</a>. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a <a href="flehmen">flehmen</a> gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. <a href="Copulation%20%28zoology%29">Copulation</a> consists of a single pelvic thrust.

<a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> lasts five to six months, after which a single calf (or rarely twins) is born. Most births take place in the spring (October to November), prior to the onset of the rainy season. The infant weighs ; the female keeps her calf hidden in cover while she is away. Mother and calf rejoin the herd about three to four weeks after parturition; the young are weaned at five or six months. When the mother gives birth again, the previous offspring, now 6 to 12 months old, deserts her to join herds of adult springbok. Thus, a female can calve twice a year, and even thrice if one calf dies. Springbok live for up to 10 years in the wild.

Springbok inhabit the dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. Their range extends from northwestern South Africa through the Kalahari desert into <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> and Botswana. The <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> marks the eastern limit of the range, from where it extends westward to the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and northward to southern Angola and Botswana. In Botswana, they mostly occur in the Kalahari desert in the southwestern and central parts of the country. They are widespread across Namibia and the vast grasslands of the Free State and the shrublands of Karoo in South Africa; however, they are confined to the Namib Desert in Angola.

The historic range of the springbok stretched across the dry grasslands, bushlands, and shrublands of south-western and southern Africa; springbok migrated sporadically in southern parts of the range. These migrations are rarely seen nowadays, but seasonal congregations can still be observed in preferred areas of short vegetation, such as the Kalahari desert.

The springbok has been classified as least concern by the IUCN. No major threats to the long-term survival of the species are known. In fact, the springbok is one of the few antelope species with a positive population trend.

Springbok occur in several protected areas across their range: <a href="Makgadikgadi%20and%20Nxai%20National%20Park">Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park</a> (Botswana); <a href="Kgalagadi%20Transfrontier%20Park">Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park</a> between Botswana and South Africa; Etosha National Park and <a href="Namib-Naukluft%20Park">Namib-Naukluft Park</a> (Namibia); <a href="Mokala%20National%20Park">Mokala</a> and <a href="Karoo%20National%20Park">Karoo</a> National Parks and a number of provincial reserves in South Africa. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the springbok population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it might be an underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East's estimate. Springbok are under active management in several private lands. Small populations have been introduced into private lands and provincial areas of <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>.

Springbok are hunted as game throughout Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa because of their attractive coats; they are common hunting targets due to their large numbers and the ease with which they can be supported on farmlands. The export of springbok skins, mainly from Namibia and South Africa, is a booming industry; these skins serve as <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a> models. The meat is a prized fare, and is readily available in South African supermarkets. As of 2011, the springbok, the <a href="gemsbok">gemsbok</a>, and the <a href="greater%20kudu">greater kudu</a> collectively account for around two-thirds of the game meat production from Namibian farmlands; nearly of the springbok meat is exported as <a href="mechanically%20deboned%20meat">mechanically deboned meat</a> to overseas markets.

The <a href="latissimus%20dorsi%20muscle">latissimus dorsi muscle</a> of the springbok comprises 1.1–1.3% <a href="Ash%20%28analytical%20chemistry%29">ash</a>, 1.3–3.5% <a href="fat">fat</a>, 72–75% moisture and 18–22% <a href="protein">protein</a>. <a href="Stearic%20acid">Stearic acid</a> is the main <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>, accounting for 24–27% of the fatty acids. The <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> content varies from per of meat. The <a href="pH">pH</a> of the meat increases if the springbok is under stress or cropping is done improperly; consequently, the quality deteriorates and the colour darkens. The meat might be adversely affected if the animal is killed by shooting. The meat may be consumed raw or used in prepared dishes. <a href="Biltong">Biltong</a> can be prepared by preserving the raw meat with vinegar, spices, and table salt, without <a href="fermentation">fermentation</a>, followed by drying. Springbok meat may also be used in preparing <a href="salami">salami</a>; a study found that the flavour of this salami is better than mutton salami, and feels oilier than salami of beef, horse meat, or mutton.

The springbok has been a <a href="national%20symbol%20of%20South%20Africa">national symbol of South Africa</a> since the <a href="History%20of%20South%20Africa%23The%20apartheid%20era%201948%E2%80%931991">white minority rule in the 20th century</a>. It was adopted as a nickname or <a href="mascot">mascot</a> by several South African sports teams, most famously by the <a href="Springbok%20Rugby%20Team">national rugby union team</a>. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa. Even after the decline of apartheid, <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> intervened to keep the name of the animal for the reconciliation of rugby fans, the majority of whom were whites.

The cap badge of <a href="The%20Royal%20Canadian%20Dragoons">The Royal Canadian Dragoons</a> has featured a springbok since 1913, a reference to the unit's involvement in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>.

Speed of light

The speed of light in <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>, commonly denoted , is a universal <a href="physical%20constant">physical constant</a> important in many areas of <a href="physics">physics</a>. Its exact value is (approximately ). It is exact because by international agreement a <a href="Metre%23Speed%20of%20light%20definition">metre</a> is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 <a href="second">second</a>. According to <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>, is the maximum speed at which all conventional matter and hence all known forms of <a href="physical%20information">information</a> in the <a href="universe">universe</a> can travel. Though this speed is most commonly associated with <a href="light">light</a>, it is in fact the speed at which all <a href="massless%20particle">massless particle</a>s and changes of the associated <a href="field%20%28physics%29">fields</a> travel in vacuum (including <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> and <a href="gravitational%20wave">gravitational wave</a>s). Such particles and waves travel at regardless of the motion of the source or the <a href="inertial%20frame%20of%20reference">inertial reference frame</a> of the observer. In the <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">special and general theories of relativity</a>, interrelates <a href="spacetime">space and time</a>, and also appears in the famous equation of <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> .

The speed at which light propagates through <a href="Transparency%20and%20translucency">transparent materials</a>, such as glass or air, is less than ; similarly, the speed of <a href="electromagnetic%20waves">electromagnetic waves</a> in wire cables is slower than . The ratio between and the speed at which light travels in a material is called the <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> of the material (). For example, for <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a> the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at ; the <a href="refractive%20index%20of%20air">refractive index of air</a> for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about , which is about slower than .

For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant <a href="space%20probes">space probes</a>, it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of <a href="computer">computer</a>s, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with <a href="time%20of%20flight">time of flight</a> measurements to measure large distances to high precision.

<a href="Ole%20R%C3%B8mer">Ole Rømer</a> first <a href="R%C3%B8mer%27s%20determination%20of%20the%20speed%20of%20light">demonstrated in 1676</a> that light travels at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a>. In 1865, <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed appearing in his theory of electromagnetism. In 1905, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> postulated that the speed of light with respect to any inertial frame is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source. He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity and in doing so showed that the parameter had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.

After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be with a <a href="measurement%20uncertainty">measurement uncertainty</a> of 4 parts per billion. In 1983, the <a href="metre">metre</a> was redefined in the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in 1/ of a <a href="second">second</a>.

The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase , for "constant" or the Latin (meaning "swiftness, celerity"). In 1856, <a href="Wilhelm%20Eduard%20Weber">Wilhelm Eduard Weber</a> and <a href="Rudolf%20Kohlrausch">Rudolf Kohlrausch</a> had used for a different constant later shown to equal times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol "V" was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> in 1865. In 1894, <a href="Paul%20Drude">Paul Drude</a> redefined with its modern meaning. <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein</a> used "V" in his <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20papers">original German-language papers</a> on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched to , which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.

Sometimes is used for the speed of waves in "any" material medium, and for the speed of light in vacuum. This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature, has the same form as other related constants: namely, "μ" for the <a href="vacuum%20permeability">vacuum permeability</a> or magnetic constant, "ε" for the <a href="vacuum%20permittivity">vacuum permittivity</a> or electric constant, and "Z" for the <a href="impedance%20of%20free%20space">impedance of free space</a>. This article uses exclusively for the speed of light in vacuum.

Since 1983, the metre has been defined in the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI) as the distance light travels in vacuum in of a second. This definition fixes the speed of light in vacuum at exactly .
As a <a href="Physical%20constant%23Dimensional%20and%20dimensionless%20physical%20constants">dimensional physical constant</a>, the numerical value of is different for different unit systems.
In branches of physics in which appears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems of <a href="natural%20units">natural units</a> of measurement or the <a href="geometrized%20unit%20system">geometrized unit system</a> where . Using these units, does not appear explicitly because multiplication or division by 1 does not affect the result.

The speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of the <a href="inertial%20frame%20of%20reference">inertial frame of reference</a> of the observer. This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by Einstein in 1905, after being motivated by <a href="Maxwell%27s%20theory%20of%20electromagnetism">Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism</a> and the lack of evidence for the <a href="luminiferous%20aether">luminiferous aether</a>; it has since been consistently confirmed by many experiments. It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure the <a href="one-way%20speed%20of%20light">one-way speed of light</a> (for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized. However, by adopting <a href="Einstein%20synchronization">Einstein synchronization</a> for the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition. The <a href="special%20theory%20of%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a> explores the consequences of this invariance of "c" with the assumption that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. One consequence is that "c" is the speed at which all <a href="massless%20particle">massless particle</a>s and waves, including light, must travel in vacuum.
Special relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the <a href="Mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">equivalence of mass and energy</a> , <a href="length%20contraction">length contraction</a> (moving objects shorten), and <a href="time%20dilation">time dilation</a> (moving clocks run more slowly). The factor "γ" by which lengths contract and times dilate is known as the <a href="Lorentz%20factor">Lorentz factor</a> and is given by , where "v" is the speed of the object. The difference of "γ" from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower than "c", such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by <a href="Galilean%20relativity">Galilean relativity</a>—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as "v" approaches "c". For example, a time dilation factor of "γ" = 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light ("v" = .866"c"). Similarly, a time dilation factor of "γ" = 10 occurs at "v" = 99.5% "c".

The results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known as <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> (with "c" relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special <a href="Symmetry%20in%20physics">symmetry</a> called <a href="Lorentz%20invariance">Lorentz invariance</a>, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameter "c". Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a>, <a href="quantum%20chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a>, the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>, and <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. As such, the parameter "c" is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts that "c" is also the <a href="speed%20of%20gravity">speed of gravity</a> and of <a href="gravitational%20waves">gravitational waves</a>. In <a href="non-inertial%20frame">non-inertial frame</a>s of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or <a href="accelerated%20reference%20frame">accelerated reference frame</a>s), the "local" speed of light is constant and equal to "c", but the <a href="Propagation%20of%20light%20in%20non-inertial%20reference%20frames">speed of light along a trajectory of finite length</a> can differ from "c", depending on how distances and times are defined.

It is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as "c" have the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the <a href="Variable%20speed%20of%20light">speed of light may have changed over time</a>. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.

It also is generally assumed that the speed of light is <a href="isotropy">isotropic</a>, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclear <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s as a function of the orientation of the emitting <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> in a magnetic field (see <a href="Hughes%E2%80%93Drever%20experiment">Hughes–Drever experiment</a>), and of rotating <a href="optical%20resonator">optical resonator</a>s (see <a href="Michelson%E2%80%93Morley%20experiment%23Recent%20experiments">Resonator experiments</a>) have put stringent limits on the possible two-way anisotropy.

According to special relativity, the energy of an object with <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> "m" and speed "v" is given by , where "γ" is the Lorentz factor defined above. When "v" is zero, "γ" is equal to one, giving rise to the famous formula for <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a>. The "γ" factor approaches infinity as "v" approaches "c", and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is experimentally established in many <a href="tests%20of%20relativistic%20energy%20and%20momentum">tests of relativistic energy and momentum</a>.
More generally, it is normally impossible for information or energy to travel faster than "c". One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the <a href="relativity%20of%20simultaneity">relativity of simultaneity</a>. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by "c" then there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than "c" relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and <a href="causality%20%28physics%29">causality</a> would be violated. In such a frame of reference, an "effect" could be observed before its "cause". Such a violation of causality has never been recorded, and would lead to <a href="paradox">paradox</a>es such as the <a href="tachyonic%20antitelephone">tachyonic antitelephone</a>.

There are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater than "c", but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the <a href="%23In%20a%20medium">propagation of light in a medium</a> section below, many wave velocities can exceed "c". For example, the <a href="phase%20velocity">phase velocity</a> of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s through most glasses can routinely exceed "c", but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.

If a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster than "c", although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speed "c". However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed "c" from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster than "c", after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.

The rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their <a href="Faster-than-light%23Closing%20speeds">closing speed</a>) may have a value in excess of "c". However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.

Certain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than "c", as in the <a href="EPR%20paradox">EPR paradox</a>. An example involves the <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>s of two particles that can be <a href="quantum%20entanglement">entangled</a>. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a <a href="quantum%20superposition">superposition</a> of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.

Another quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called the <a href="Hartman%20effect">Hartman effect</a>: under certain conditions the time needed for a <a href="virtual%20particle">virtual particle</a> to <a href="quantum%20tunnelling">tunnel</a> through a barrier is constant, regardless of the thickness of the barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.

So-called <a href="superluminal%20motion">superluminal motion</a> is seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the <a href="relativistic%20jet">relativistic jet</a>s of <a href="radio%20galaxy">radio galaxies</a> and <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s. However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a <a href="graphical%20projection">projection</a> effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.

In models of the expanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion "through" space, but rather to the <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">expansion of space</a> itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the <a href="Hubble%20sphere">Hubble sphere</a>, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.

In <a href="classical%20physics">classical physics</a>, light is described as a type of <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a>. The classical behaviour of the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a> is described by <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a>, which predict that the speed "c" with which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate through the vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of the vacuum, otherwise respectively known as the <a href="electric%20constant">electric constant</a> "ε" and the <a href="magnetic%20constant">magnetic constant</a> "μ", by the equation

In modern <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory of <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a> (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, called <a href="photon">photon</a>s. In QED, photons are <a href="massless%20particle">massless particle</a>s and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.

Extensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed "c" of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum. No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing, putting stringent limits on the mass of the photon. The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the massive photon is described by <a href="Proca%20action">Proca theory</a>, the experimental upper bound for its mass is about 10 <a href="gram">gram</a>s; if photon mass is generated by a <a href="Higgs%20mechanism">Higgs mechanism</a>, the experimental upper limit is less sharp,   (roughly 2 × 10 g).

Another reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>. In 2009, the observation of the spectrum of <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a> <a href="GRB%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B090510">GRB 090510</a> did not find any difference in the speeds of photons of different energies, confirming that Lorentz invariance is verified at least down to the scale of the <a href="Planck%20length">Planck length</a> ("l" =  ≈ ) divided by 1.2.

In a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to "c"; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a <a href="plane%20wave">plane wave</a> (a wave filling the whole space, with only one <a href="frequency">frequency</a>) propagate is called the <a href="phase%20velocity">phase velocity</a> "v". An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the <a href="group%20velocity">group velocity</a> "v", and its earliest part travels at the <a href="front%20velocity">front velocity</a> "v".
The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a "refractive index". The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of "c" to the phase velocity "v" in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a>, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The <a href="refractive%20index%20of%20air">refractive index of air</a> is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as <a href="Optical%20properties%20of%20water%20and%20ice">water</a>, <a href="glass">glass</a>, and <a href="Material%20properties%20of%20diamond%23Optical%20properties">diamond</a>, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In exotic materials like <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose–Einstein condensate</a>s near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-"c" speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light "slowing" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a "complete standstill" by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a>, one team at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and the <a href="Rowland%20Institute%20for%20Science">Rowland Institute for Science</a> in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the <a href="Harvard%E2%80%93Smithsonian%20Center%20for%20Astrophysics">Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</a>, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being "stopped" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had "stopped," it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which "slow" the speed of light.

In transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than "c". In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the <a href="real%20and%20imaginary%20parts">real and imaginary parts</a> of the <a href="dielectric%20constant">dielectric constant</a> of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the <a href="attenuation%20coefficient">attenuation coefficient</a>, are linked by the <a href="Kramers%E2%80%93Kronig%20relation">Kramers–Kronig relation</a>s. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than "c".

A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as <a href="Dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called <a href="slow%20light">slow light</a>, which has been confirmed in various experiments.
The opposite, group velocities exceeding "c", has also been shown in experiment. It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time.

None of these options, however, allow information to be transmitted faster than "c". It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the <a href="front%20velocity">front velocity</a>). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to "c". 

It is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than "c"). When a <a href="charged%20particle">charged particle</a> does that in a <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>, known as <a href="Cherenkov%20radiation">Cherenkov radiation</a>, is emitted.

The speed of light is of relevance to <a href="telecommunication">communications</a>: the one-way and <a href="round-trip%20delay%20time">round-trip delay time</a> are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.

In <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between <a href="central%20processing%20unit">processors</a>. If a processor operates at 1 <a href="gigahertz">gigahertz</a>, a signal can only travel a maximum of about in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single <a href="integrated%20circuit">chips</a>.

Given that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about and that "c" is about , the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is travelling around the globe in an <a href="optical%20fibre">optical fibre</a>, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its refractive index "n". Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator.

Similarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between <a href="Mission%20Control%20Center">ground control</a> and <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and <a href="Mars">Mars</a> can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.

NASA must wait several hours for information from a probe orbiting Jupiter, and if it needs to correct a navigation error, the fix will not arrive at the spacecraft for an equal amount of time, creating a risk of the correction not arriving in time.

Receiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, it has taken 13 billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the <a href="Hubble%20Ultra%20Deep%20Field">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the <a href="evolution%20of%20stars">evolution of stars</a>, <a href="Galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">of galaxies</a>, and <a href="history%20of%20the%20universe">of the universe</a> itself.

Astronomical distances are sometimes expressed in <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s, especially in <a href="popular%20science">popular science</a> publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461 billion kilometres, 5879 billion miles, or 0.3066 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10 trillion kilometres or nearly 6 trillion miles. <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.

<a href="Radar">Radar</a> systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip <a href="Radar%23Transit%20time">transit time</a> multiplied by the speed of light. A <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about () in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The <a href="Lunar%20Laser%20Ranging%20Experiment">Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a>, <a href="radar%20astronomy">radar astronomy</a> and the <a href="Deep%20Space%20Network">Deep Space Network</a> determine distances to the Moon, planets and spacecraft, respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.

The speed of light has become important in <a href="high-frequency%20trading">high-frequency trading</a>, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to <a href="microwave">microwave</a> communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the speed of light in air, have over <a href="fibre%20optic">fibre optic</a> signals which travel 30–40% slower at the speed of light through glass.

There are different ways to determine the value of "c". One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine "c" from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants <a href="relative%20permittivity">"ε"</a> and <a href="permeability%20%28electromagnetism%29">"μ"</a> and using their relation to "c". Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling "c".

In 1983 the metre was defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of of a second", fixing the value of the speed of light at by definition, as <a href="%23Increased%20accuracy%20of%20c%20and%20redefinition%20of%20the%20metre%20and%20second">described below</a>. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of "c".

<a href="Outer%20space">Outer space</a> is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>, such as the <a href="radius">radius</a> of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU) per day.

<a href="Ole%20Christensen%20R%C3%B8mer">Ole Christensen Rømer</a> used an astronomical measurement to make <a href="R%C3%B8mer%27s%20determination%20of%20the%20speed%20of%20light">the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light</a>. When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the <a href="diameter">diameter</a> of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s innermost moon <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a> and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.
Another method is to use the <a href="aberration%20of%20light">aberration of light</a>, discovered and explained by <a href="James%20Bradley">James Bradley</a> in the 18th century. This effect results from the <a href="vector%20addition">vector addition</a> of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

An astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly . Previously the AU was not based on the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> but in terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of classical mechanics. The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which was determined by measurement. This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre, and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).

Previously, the inverse of  expressed in seconds per astronomical unit was measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, a <a href="best%20fit">best fit</a> value for the light time per unit distance could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as approved by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU), was:
The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry. Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in metres.

A method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the <a href="Fizeau%E2%80%93Foucault%20apparatus">Fizeau–Foucault apparatus</a> developed by <a href="Hippolyte%20Fizeau">Hippolyte Fizeau</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Foucault">Léon Foucault</a>.

The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.

The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.

Nowadays, using <a href="oscilloscopes">oscilloscopes</a> with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.

An option for deriving "c" that does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation between "c" and the <a href="vacuum%20permittivity">vacuum permittivity</a> "ε" and <a href="vacuum%20permeability">vacuum permeability</a> "μ" established by Maxwell's theory: "c" = 1/("ε""μ"). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a> and dimensions of a <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>, whereas the value of the <a href="vacuum%20permeability">vacuum permeability</a> is fixed at exactly through the definition of the <a href="ampere%20%28unit%29">ampere</a>. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to find a value of .

Another way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequency "f" and wavelength "λ" of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of "c" can then be found by using the relation "c" = "fλ". One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a <a href="cavity%20resonator">cavity resonator</a>. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, <a href="Louis%20Essen">Louis Essen</a> and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of <a href="normal%20mode">normal mode</a>s of microwaves of a <a href="microwave%20cavity">microwave cavity</a> of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from <a href="electromagnetic%20theory">electromagnetic theory</a>, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.

The Essen–Gordon-Smith result, , was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques. By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of .

A household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a <a href="microwave%20oven">microwave oven</a> and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the <a href="antinode">antinode</a>s (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value of "c" can be calculated, "often with less than 5% error".

<a href="Interferometry">Interferometry</a> is another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A <a href="Coherence%20%28physics%29">coherent</a> beam of light (e.g. from a <a href="laser">laser</a>), with a known frequency ("f"), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the <a href="interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference pattern</a> and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light ("λ") can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation "c" = "λf".

Before the advent of laser technology, coherent <a href="radiowave">radio</a> sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light. However interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NIST</a>). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a <a href="Measurement%20uncertainty">fractional uncertainty</a> of .

Until the <a href="early%20modern%20period">early modern period</a>, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.

<a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> (c. 490–430 BC) was the first to propose a theory of light and claimed that light has a finite speed. He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> argued, to the contrary, that "light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement". <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> and <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> advanced Empedocles' <a href="Emission%20theory%20%28vision%29">emission theory</a> of vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory, <a href="Heron%20of%20Alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</a> argued that the speed of light must be <a href="Infinity">infinite</a> because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.

<a href="Early%20Islamic%20philosophy">Early Islamic philosophers</a> initially agreed with the <a href="Aristotelian%20physics">Aristotelian view</a> that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, <a href="Alhazen">Alhazen</a> (Ibn al-Haytham) published the "<a href="Book%20of%20Optics">Book of Optics</a>", in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of <a href="Visual%20perception">vision</a> in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Rayh%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī</a> agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.

In the 13th century, <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> argued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, <a href="Witelo">Witelo</a> considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.

In the early 17th century, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> believed that the speed of light was infinite, since empty space presents no obstacle to it. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> argued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished. In Descartes' derivation of <a href="Snell%27s%20law">Snell's law</a>, he assumed that even though the speed of light was instantaneous, the denser the medium, the faster was light's speed. <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a> derived Snell's law using the opposing assumption, the denser the medium the slower light traveled. Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light.

In 1629, <a href="Isaac%20Beeckman">Isaac Beeckman</a> proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638, <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the <a href="Accademia%20del%20Cimento">Accademia del Cimento</a> of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 <a href="microsecond">microsecond</a>s.
The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see <a href="R%C3%B8mer%27s%20determination%20of%20the%20speed%20of%20light">Rømer's determination of the speed of light</a>). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a> appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.

In his 1704 book "<a href="Opticks">Opticks</a>", <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> reported Rømer's calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of "seven or eight minutes" for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds). Newton queried whether Rømer's eclipse shadows were coloured; hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, <a href="James%20Bradley">James Bradley</a> discovered <a href="aberration%20of%20light">stellar aberration</a>. From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

In the 19th century <a href="Hippolyte%20Fizeau">Hippolyte Fizeau</a> developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of . His method was improved upon by <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Foucault">Léon Foucault</a> who obtained a value of in 1862. In the year 1856, <a href="Wilhelm%20Eduard%20Weber">Wilhelm Eduard Weber</a> and <a href="Rudolf%20Kohlrausch">Rudolf Kohlrausch</a> measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/, by discharging a <a href="Leyden%20jar">Leyden jar</a>, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> calculated that an electric signal in a <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistanceless</a> wire travels along the wire at this speed. In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.

It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the <a href="luminiferous%20aether">luminiferous aether</a> in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a <a href="preferred%20frame">preferred frame</a> of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is <a href="Michelson%E2%80%93Morley%20experiment">the experiment</a> performed by <a href="Albert%20A.%20Michelson">Albert A. Michelson</a> and <a href="Edward%20W.%20Morley">Edward W. Morley</a> in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.
Because of this experiment <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to <a href="Lorentz%20contraction">contract</a> along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the <a href="Lorentz%20transformation">Lorentz transformation</a>. Based on <a href="Lorentz%20ether%20theory">Lorentz's aether theory</a>, <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a> (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the <a href="principle%20of%20relativity">principle of relativity</a>.

In 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the <a href="special%20theory%20of%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a>, in which the speed of light in vacuum "c" featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.

In the second half of the 20th century much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, <a href="Louis%20Essen">Louis Essen</a> determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the <a href="history%20of%20the%20metre%23Krypton%20standard">metre was redefined</a> in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the <a href="second">second</a> was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of <a href="caesium-133">caesium-133</a>.

In 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Bureau of Standards</a> in <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a> determined the speed of light in vacuum to be "c" = . This was 100 times less <a href="Measurement%20uncertainty">uncertain</a> than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre. As similar experiments found comparable results for "c", the 15th <a href="General%20Conference%20on%20Weights%20and%20Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> in 1975 recommended using the value for the speed of light.

In 1983 the 17th CGPM found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more <a href="reproducibility">reproducible</a> than the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of <a href="second">second</a>, so the <a href="caesium">caesium</a> <a href="Hyperfine%20structure%23Use%20in%20defining%20the%20SI%20second%20and%20meter">hyperfine frequency</a> would now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as: "The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/ of a second." As a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units. Improved experimental techniques that prior to 1983 would have measured the speed of light, no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of Krypton-86 and other light sources.

In 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls "the explicit-constant formulation", where each "unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant", as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre's definition: "The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly when it is expressed in the SI unit ." This is one of the proposed changes to be incorporated in the <a href="2019%20redefinition%20of%20SI%20base%20units">next revision of the SI</a> also termed the "New SI".

It was formed in a <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a> which began below sea level, and reached the surface on 14 November 1963. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when the island reached its maximum size of . Since then, wave erosion has caused the island to steadily diminish in size: , its surface area was . The most recent survey (2007) shows the island's maximum elevation at above sea level.

The new island was named after "<a href="Surtr">Surtr</a>", a fire "<a href="j%C3%B6tunn">jötunn</a>" or giant from <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. It was intensively studied by <a href="Volcanology">volcanologists</a> during its eruption, and afterwards by <a href="botany">botanists</a> and other <a href="biology">biologists</a> as life forms gradually colonised the originally barren island. The undersea vents that produced Surtsey are part of the "<a href="Vestmannaeyjar">Vestmannaeyjar</a>" submarine volcanic system, part of the fissure of the sea floor called the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous eruption of "<a href="Eldfell">Eldfell</a>" on the island of <a href="Heimaey">Heimaey</a> in 1973. The eruption that created Surtsey also created a few other small islands along this volcanic chain, such as "<a href="J%C3%B3lnir">Jólnir</a>" and other unnamed peaks. Most of these eroded away fairly quickly. It is estimated that Surtsey will remain above sea level for another 100 years.

The eruption was unexpected, and almost certainly began some days before it became apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions could no longer be contained, and activity broke the surface.

The first noticeable indications of volcanic activity were recorded at the seismic station in <a href="Kirkjub%C3%A6jarklaustur">Kirkjubæjarklaustur</a>, Iceland from 6 to 8 November, which detected weak tremors emanating from an <a href="epicentre">epicentre</a> approximately west-south-west at a distance of , the location of Surtsey. Another station in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a> recorded even weaker tremors for ten hours on 12 November at an undetermined location, when seismic activity ceased until 21 November. That same day, people in the coastal town of <a href="V%C3%ADk">Vík</a> away noticed a smell of <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulphide</a>. On 13 November, a fishing vessel in search of herring, equipped with sensitive thermometers, noted sea temperatures SW of the eruption center were higher than surrounding waters.

At 07:15 <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">UTC</a> on 14 November 1963, the cook of "Ísleifur II", a trawler sailing these same waters, spotted a rising column of dark smoke southwest of the boat. The captain thought it might have been a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the <a href="eruption%20column">eruption column</a> had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending <a href="fissure">fissure</a>, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of <a href="scoria">scoria</a>, measured over in length and had reached a height of .

As the eruptions continued, they became concentrated at one vent along the fissure and began to build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about . The violent explosions caused by the meeting of <a href="lava">lava</a> and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (<a href="scoria">scoria</a>), which was eroded rapidly by North <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over .

The explosive <a href="Phreatic%20eruption">phreatomagmatic</a> eruptions caused by the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6 mi) away from the island, and sent <a href="Volcanic%20ash">ash</a> clouds as high as up into the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. The loose pile of unconsolidated <a href="tephra">tephra</a> would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during this stage of the eruption.

The new island was named after the fire <a href="j%C3%B6tunn">jötunn</a> <a href="Surtur">Surtur</a> from <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a> ("Surts" is the <a href="genitive%20case">genitive case</a> of "Surtur", plus <a href="%3Awikt%3Aey">-ey</a>, "island"). Three French journalists representing the magazine "<a href="Paris%20Match">Paris Match</a>" notably landed there on 6 December 1963, staying for about 15 minutes before violent explosions encouraged them to leave. The journalists jokingly claimed French <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> over the island, but Iceland quickly asserted that the new island belonged to it.

By early 1964, though, the continuing eruptions had built the island to such a size that sea water could no longer easily reach the vents, and the volcanic activity became much less <a href="Explosive%20eruption">explosive</a>. Instead, <a href="lava%20fountain">lava fountain</a>s and <a href="lava%20flow">flows</a> became the main form of activity. These resulted in a hard cap of extremely erosion-resistant rock being laid down on top of much of the loose volcanic pile, which prevented the island from being washed away rapidly. Effusive eruptions continued until 1965, by which time the island had a surface area of .

On 28 December 1963, <a href="Submarine%20eruption">submarine activity</a> to the northeast of Surtsey caused the formation of a ridge high on the sea floor. This <a href="seamount">seamount</a> was named <a href="Surtla">Surtla</a>, but never reached sea level. Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth of below sea level.

In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named <a href="Syrtlingur">Syrtlingur</a> (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of . Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.

During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named <a href="J%C3%B3lnir">Jólnir</a>, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.

Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was above sea level at that time.

Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size. A large area on the southeast side has been eroded away completely, while a sand spit called "Norðurtangi" (north point) has grown on the north side of the island. It is estimated that about of material has been lost due to erosion—this represents about a quarter of the original above-sea-level volume of the island. Its maximum elevation has diminished to .

Following the end of the eruption, scientists established a grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change in the shape of the island. In the 20 years following the end of the eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about per year but slowed to a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose <a href="tephra">tephra</a> forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s underlying the island, and downward warping of the <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> due to the weight of the volcano.

Volcanoes in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago are typically <a href="monogenetic%20volcano">monogenetic</a>, and so the island is unlikely to be enlarged in the future by further eruptions. The heavy seas around the island have been eroding it ever since the island appeared, and since the end of the eruption almost half of its original area has been lost. The island currently loses about of its surface area each year.

This island is unlikely to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose <a href="tephra">tephra</a>, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant <a href="tuff">tuff</a> material, in a process known as <a href="Palagonite">palagonitization</a>. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.

Estimates of how long Surtsey will survive are based on the rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an assessment assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed in the same way as Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.

A classic site for the study of <a href="Colonisation%20%28biology%29">biocolonisation</a> from <a href="founder%20population">founder population</a>s that arrive from outside ("<a href="allochthon">allochthon</a>ous"), Surtsey was declared a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared the island a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, in recognition of its great scientific value.

In the spring of 1965, the first <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a> was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, <a href="moss">moss</a>es became visible in 1967, and <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular as they have been of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and <a href="fungi">fungi</a> in the development of vegetation.

Mosses and lichens now cover much of the island. During the island's first 20 years, 20 species of plants were observed at one time or another, but only 10 became established in the nutrient-poor sandy soil.
As birds began nesting on the island, soil conditions improved, and more vascular plant species were able to survive. In 1998, the first <a href="Woody%20plant">bush</a> was found on the island—a tea-leaved <a href="willow">willow</a> ("<a href="Salix%20phylicifolia">Salix phylicifolia</a>"), which can grow to heights of up to . By 2008, 69 species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5 new species per year.

The expansion of <a href="bird">bird</a> life on the <a href="island">island</a> has both relied on and helped to advance the spread of plant life. Birds use the plants for nesting material, but also continue to assist in the spreading of seeds, and fertilize the soil with their <a href="guano">guano</a>. Birds first began nesting on Surtsey three years after the eruptions ended, with <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a> and <a href="guillemot">guillemot</a> the first species to set up home. Twelve species are now regularly found on the island.

A <a href="gull">gull</a> colony has been present since 1984, although gulls were seen briefly on the shores of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a>s, which are extremely common in the rest of the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>.

As well as providing a home for some species of birds, Surtsey has also been used as a stopping-off point for <a href="bird%20migration">migrating</a> birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include <a href="whooper%20swan">whooper swan</a>s, various species of <a href="geese">geese</a>, and <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>s. Although Surtsey lies to the west of the main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.

According to a 30 May 2009 report, a <a href="golden%20plover">golden plover</a> was nesting on the island with four eggs.

Soon after the island's formation, <a href="Pinniped">seals</a> were seen around the island. They soon began basking there, particularly on the northern spit, which grew as the waves eroded the island. Seals were found to be breeding on the island in 1983, and a group of up to 70 made the island their breeding spot. <a href="Grey%20seal">Grey seal</a>s are more common on the island than <a href="harbour%20seal">harbour seal</a>s, but both are now well established. The presence of seals attracts <a href="orca">orca</a>s, which are frequently seen in the waters around the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago and now frequent the waters around Surtsey.

On the submarine portion of the island, many marine species are found. <a href="Starfish">Starfish</a> are abundant, as are <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s and <a href="limpet">limpet</a>s. The rocks are covered in <a href="algae">algae</a>, and <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> covers much of the submarine slopes of the volcano, with its densest cover between below sea level.

Insects arrived on Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first detected in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, carried to the island by winds and their own power. Some were believed to have been blown across from as far away as <a href="mainland%20Europe">mainland Europe</a>. Later insect life arrived on floating <a href="driftwood">driftwood</a>, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered <a href="tussock%20%28grass%29">tussock</a> was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly <a href="mite">mite</a>s and <a href="springtail">springtail</a>s, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.

The establishment of insect life provided some food for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> insects, while the fertilisation of the soil and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a> insects.

Some higher forms of land life are now colonising the soil of Surtsey. The first <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a> was found in a soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from <a href="Heimaey">Heimaey</a> by a bird. However, the next year earthworms were not found. <a href="Slug">Slug</a>s were found in 1998, and appeared to be similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s have also become established.

The only other significant human impact is a small prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.
In 2009 a weather station for weather observations and a webcam were installed on Surtsey.

Standard Generalized Markup Language

The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML; <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> 8879:1986) is a standard for defining generalized <a href="markup%20language">markup language</a>s for documents. ISO 8879 Annex A.1 defines generalized markup:-

Generalized markup is based on two <a href="postulate">postulate</a>s:

<a href="HTML">HTML</a> was theoretically an example of an SGML-based language until <a href="HTML%205">HTML 5</a>, which browsers cannot parse as SGML for compatibility reasons.

<a href="DocBook">DocBook</a> SGML and <a href="LinuxDoc">LinuxDoc</a> are examples which were used almost exclusively with actual SGML tools.

SGML is an <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> standard: "ISO 8879:1986 Information processing – Text and office systems – Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)", of which there are three versions:


SGML is part of a trio of enabling ISO standards for <a href="electronic%20document">electronic document</a>s developed by <a href="ISO/IEC%20JTC1/SC34">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34</a> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages) :


SGML is supported by various technical reports, in particular


SGML descended from <a href="International%20Business%20Machines">IBM</a>'s <a href="IBM%20Generalized%20Markup%20Language">Generalized Markup Language</a> (GML), which <a href="Charles%20Goldfarb">Charles Goldfarb</a>, Edward Mosher, and Raymond Lorie developed in the 1960s. Goldfarb, editor of the international standard, coined the “GML” term using their surname initials. Goldfarb also wrote the definitive work on SGML syntax in "The SGML Handbook". The syntax of SGML is closer to the <a href="COCOA%20%28digital%20humanities%29">COCOA</a> format. As a document markup language, SGML was originally designed to enable the sharing of <a href="Machine-readable%20data">machine-readable</a> large-project documents in government, law, and industry. Many such documents must remain readable for several decades—a long time in the <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> field. SGML also was extensively applied by the military, and the aerospace, technical reference, and industrial publishing industries. The advent of the <a href="XML">XML</a> profile has made SGML suitable for widespread application for small-scale, general-purpose use.

SGML (ENR+WWW) defines two kinds of validity. According to the revised Terms and Definitions of ISO 8879 (from the public draft):
A conforming SGML document must be either a type-valid SGML document, a tag-valid SGML document, or both. Note: A user may wish to enforce additional constraints on a document, such as whether a document instance is integrally-stored or free of entity references.
A type-valid SGML document is defined by the standard as
An SGML document in which, for each document instance, there is an associated <a href="document%20type%20declaration">document type declaration</a> (DTD) to whose DTD that instance conforms.
A tag-valid SGML document is defined by the standard as
An SGML document, all of whose document instances are fully tagged. There need not be a <a href="document%20type%20declaration">document type declaration</a> associated with any of the instances. Note: If there is a <a href="document%20type%20declaration">document type declaration</a>, the instance can be parsed with or without reference to it.
"Tag-validity" was introduced in SGML (ENR+WWW) to support <a href="XML">XML</a> which allows documents with no DOCTYPE declaration but which can be parsed without a grammar or documents which have a DOCTYPE declaration that makes no <a href="XML%20Infoset">XML Infoset</a> contributions to the document. The standard calls this "fully tagged". "Integrally stored" reflects the <a href="XML">XML</a> requirement that elements end in the same entity in which they started. "Reference-free" reflects the <a href="HTML">HTML</a> requirement that entity references are for special characters and do not contain markup. SGML validity commentary, especially commentary that was made before 1997 or that is unaware of SGML (ENR+WWW), covers "type-validity" only.

The SGML emphasis on validity supports the requirement for generalized markup that "markup should be rigorous." (ISO 8879 A.1)

An SGML document may have three parts:

An SGML document may be composed from many <a href="SGML%20entity">entities</a> (discrete pieces of text). In SGML, the entities and element types used in the document may be specified with a DTD, the different character sets, features, delimiter sets, and keywords are specified in the SGML Declaration to create the "concrete syntax" of the document.

Although full SGML allows implicit markup and some other kinds of tags, the <a href="XML">XML</a> specification (s4.3.1) states:

For introductory information on a basic, modern SGML syntax, see <a href="XML">XML</a>. The following material concentrates on features not in XML and is not a comprehensive summary of SGML syntax.

SGML generalizes and supports a wide range of markup languages as found in the mid 1980s. These ranged from terse <a href="Wiki">Wiki</a>-like syntaxes to <a href="Rich%20Text%20Format">RTF</a>-like bracketed languages to <a href="HTML">HTML</a>-like matching-tag languages. SGML did this by a relatively simple default "reference concrete syntax" augmented with a large number of optional features that could be enabled in the SGML Declaration. Not every SGML parser can necessarily process every SGML document. Because each processor's "System Declaration" can be compared to the document's "SGML Declaration" it is always possible to know whether a document is supported by a particular processor.

Many SGML features relate to markup minimization. Other features relate to <a href="concurrent%20markup">concurrent (parallel) markup</a> (CONCUR), to linking processing attributes (LINK), and to embedding SGML documents within SGML documents (SUBDOC).

The notion of customizable features was not appropriate for Web use, so one goal of <a href="XML">XML</a> was to minimize optional features. However XML's well-formedness rules cannot support Wiki-like languages, leaving them unstandardized and difficult to integrate with non-text information systems.

The usual (default) SGML "concrete syntax" resembles this example, which is the default <a href="HTML">HTML</a> concrete syntax:
<QUOTE TYPE="example">
</QUOTE>
SGML provides an "abstract syntax" that can be <a href="Implementation">implemented</a> in many different types of "concrete syntax". Although the markup norm is using <a href="Bracket">angle brackets</a> as start- and end- tag <a href="delimiter">delimiter</a>s in an SGML document (per the standard-defined "reference concrete syntax"), it is possible to use other characters—provided a suitable "concrete syntax" is defined in the document's <a href="SGML%20declaration">SGML declaration</a>. For example, an SGML interpreter might be programmed to parse GML, wherein the tags are delimited with a left <a href="Colon%20%28punctuation%29">colon</a> and a right <a href="full%20stop">full stop</a>, thus, an ":e" prefix denotes an end tag: codice_1. According to the reference syntax, letter-case (upper- or lower-) is not distinguished in tag names, thus the three tags: (i) codice_2, (ii) codice_3, and (iii) codice_4 are equivalent. ("NOTE:" A concrete syntax might "change" this rule via the NAMECASE NAMING declarations).

SGML has features for reducing the number of characters required to mark up a document, which must be enabled in the SGML Declaration. SGML processors need not support every available feature, thus allowing applications to tolerate many types of inadvertent markup omissions; however, SGML systems usually are intolerant of invalid structures. XML is intolerant of syntax omissions, and does not require a DTD for checking well-formedness.

Both start tags and end tags may be omitted from a document instance, provided:

For example, if OMITTAG YES is specified in the SGML Declaration (enabling the OMITTAG feature), and the DTD includes the following declarations:

<!ELEMENT chapter - - (title, section+)>
<!ELEMENT title o o (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT section - - (title, subsection+)>
then this excerpt:
<chapter>Introduction to SGML
<section>The SGML Declaration
<subsection>

which omits two tags and two tags, would represent valid markup.

Note also that omitting tags is optional – the same excerpt could be tagged like this:
<chapter><title>Introduction to SGML</title>
<section><title>The SGML Declaration</title>
<subsection>

and would still represent valid markup.
Note: The OMITTAG feature is unrelated to the tagging of elements whose declared content is codice_6 as defined in the DTD:

<!ELEMENT image - o EMPTY>
Elements defined like this have no end tag, and specifying one in the document instance would result in invalid markup. This is syntactically different than <a href="XML">XML</a> empty elements in this regard.

Tags can be replaced with delimiter strings, for a terser markup, via the SHORTREF feature. This markup style is now associated with <a href="wiki%20markup">wiki markup</a>, e.g. wherein two equals-signs (==), at the start of a line, are the “heading start-tag”, and two equals signs (==) after that are the “heading end-tag”.

SGML markup languages whose concrete syntax enables the SHORTTAG VALUE feature, do not require attribute values containing only alphanumeric characters to be enclosed within quotation marks—either double codice_7 (LIT) or single codice_8 (LITA)—so that the previous markup example could be written:
<QUOTE TYPE=example>
</QUOTE>
One feature of SGML markup languages is the "presumptuous empty tagging", such that the empty end tag codice_9 in codice_10 "inherits" its value from the nearest previous full start tag, which, in this example, is codice_11 (in other words, it closes the most recently opened item). The expression is thus equivalent to codice_12.

Another feature is the "NET" (Null End Tag) construction: codice_13, which is structurally equivalent to codice_12.

Additionally, the SHORTTAG NETENABL IMMEDNET feature allows shortening tags surrounding an empty text value, but forbids shortening full tags:
<QUOTE></QUOTE>
can be written as
<QUOTE// <!-- not a typo! -->
wherein the first <a href="Slash%20%28punctuation%29">slash</a> ( / ) stands for the NET-enabling “start-tag close” (NESTC), and the second slash stands for the NET. NOTE: XML defines NESTC with a /, and NET with an > (angled bracket)—hence the corresponding construct in XML appears as <QUOTE/>.

The third feature is 'text on the same line', allowing a markup item to be ended with a line-end; especially useful for headings and such, requiring using either SHORTREF or DATATAG minimization. For example, if the DTD includes the following declarations:
<!ELEMENT lines (line*)
<!ELEMENT line O - (#PCDATA)>
<!ENTITY line-tagc "</line>">
<!SHORTREF one-line "&#RE;&#RS;" line-tagc>
<!USEMAP one-line line>
(and "&#RE;&#RS;" is a short-reference delimiter in the concrete syntax), then:
<lines>
first line
second line
</lines>
is equivalent to:
<lines>
<line>first line</line>
<line>second line</line>
</lines>
SGML has many features that defied convenient description with the popular formal <a href="automata%20theory">automata theory</a> and the contemporary <a href="Parsing">parser</a> technology of the 1980s and the 1990s. The standard warns in Annex H:

A report on an early implementation of a parser for basic SGML, the Amsterdam SGML Parser, notes and specifies various differences.

There appears to be no definitive classification of full SGML against a known class of <a href="formal%20grammar">formal grammar</a>. Plausible classes may include <a href="tree-adjoining%20grammar">tree-adjoining grammar</a>s and <a href="adaptive%20grammar">adaptive grammar</a>s.

XML is described as being generally parsable like a <a href="two-level%20grammar">two-level grammar</a> for non-validated XML and a <a href="Melvin%20Conway">Conway</a>-style pipeline of <a href="coroutines">coroutines</a> (<a href="Lexical%20analysis">lexer</a>, <a href="parser">parser</a>, validator) for valid XML. The SGML productions in the ISO standard are reported to be LL(3) or LL(4). XML-class subsets are reported to be expressible using a <a href="W-grammar">W-grammar</a>. According to one paper, and probably considered at an "<a href="XML%20Information%20Set">information set</a>" or <a href="parse%20tree">parse tree</a> level rather than a character or delimiter level:

The SGML standard does not define SGML with formal data structures, such as <a href="parse%20tree">parse tree</a>s, however, an SGML document is constructed of a <a href="Directed%20graph">rooted directed acyclic graph</a> (RDAG) of physical storage units known as “<a href="SGML%20entity">entities</a>”, which is parsed into a RDAG of structural units known as “elements”. The physical graph is loosely characterized as an "entity tree", but entities might appear multiple times. Moreover, the structure graph is also loosely characterized as an "element tree", but the ID/IDREF markup allows arbitrary arcs.

The results of parsing can also be understood as a data tree in different notations; where the document is the root node, and entities in other notations (text, graphics) are child nodes. SGML provides apparatus for linking to and annotating external non-SGML entities.

The SGML standard describes it in terms of "maps" and "recognition modes" (s9.6.1). Each entity, and each element, can have an associated "notation" or "declared content type", which determines the kinds of references and tags which will be recognized in that entity and element. Also, each element can have an associated "delimiter map" (and "short reference map"), which determines which characters are treated as delimiters in context. The SGML standard characterizes parsing as a <a href="state%20machine">state machine</a> switching between recognition modes. During parsing, there is a stack of maps that configure the <a href="Lexical%20analysis">scanner</a>, while the <a href="Lexical%20analysis">tokenizer</a> relates to the recognition modes.

Parsing involves traversing the dynamically-retrieved entity graph, finding/implying tags and the element structure, and validating those tags against the grammar. An unusual aspect of SGML is that the grammar (DTD) is used both passively — to "recognize" lexical structures, and actively — to "generate" missing structures and tags that the DTD has declared optional. End- and start- tags can be omitted, because they can be inferred. Loosely, a series of tags can be omitted only if there is a single, possible path in the grammar to imply them. It was this active use of grammars that made concrete SGML parsing difficult to formally characterize.

SGML uses the term "validation" for both recognition and generation. XML does not use the grammar (DTD) to change delimiter maps or to inform the parse modes, and does not allow <a href="tag%20omission">tag omission</a>; consequently, XML validation of elements is not active in the sense that SGML validation is active. SGML "without" a DTD (e.g. simple XML), is a grammar or a language; SGML "with" a DTD is a <a href="metalanguage">metalanguage</a>. SGML with an SGML declaration is, perhaps, a meta-metalanguage, since it is a metalanguage whose declaration mechanism "is" a metalanguage.

SGML has an abstract syntax implemented by many possible concrete syntaxes, however, this is not the same usage as in an <a href="abstract%20syntax%20tree">abstract syntax tree</a> and as in a <a href="parse%20tree">concrete syntax tree</a>. In the SGML usage, a concrete syntax is a set of specific delimiters, while the abstract syntax is the set of names for the delimiters. The <a href="XML%20Infoset">XML Infoset</a> corresponds more to the programming language notion of abstract syntax introduced by <a href="John%20McCarthy%20%28computer%20scientist%29">John McCarthy</a>.

The <a href="W3C">W3C</a> XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a profile (subset) of SGML designed to ease the implementation of the parser compared to a full SGML parser, primarily for use on the World Wide Web. In addition to disabling many SGML options present in the reference syntax (such as omitting tags and nested subdocuments) XML adds a number of additional restrictions on the kinds of SGML syntax. For example, despite enabling SGML shortened tag forms, XML does not allow unclosed start or end tags. It also relied on many of the additions made by the WebSGML Annex. XML currently is more widely used than full SGML. XML has lightweight <a href="internationalization">internationalization</a> based on <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a>. Applications of XML include <a href="XHTML">XHTML</a>, <a href="XQuery">XQuery</a>, <a href="XSLT">XSLT</a>, <a href="XForms">XForms</a>, <a href="XPointer">XPointer</a>, <a href="JavaServer%20Pages">JSP</a>, <a href="SVG">SVG</a>, <a href="RSS%20%28file%20format%29">RSS</a>, <a href="Atom%20%28standard%29">Atom</a>, <a href="XML-RPC">XML-RPC</a>, <a href="RDF/XML">RDF/XML</a>, and <a href="Simple%20Object%20Access%20Protocol">SOAP</a>.

While HTML was developed partially independently and in parallel with SGML, its creator, <a href="Tim%20Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, intended it to be an application of SGML. The design of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) was therefore inspired by SGML tagging, but, since no clear expansion and parsing guidelines were established, most actual HTML documents are not valid SGML documents. Later, HTML was reformulated (version 2.0) to be more of an SGML application, however, the HTML markup language has many legacy- and exception- handling features that differ from SGML's requirements. HTML 4 is an SGML application that fully conforms to ISO 8879 – SGML.

The charter for the 2006 revival of the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web%20Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> HTML Working Group says, "the Group will not assume that an SGML parser is used for 'classic HTML'". Although HTML syntax closely resembles SGML syntax with the default "reference <a href="concrete%20syntax">concrete syntax</a>", <a href="HTML5">HTML5</a> abandons any attempt to define HTML as an SGML application, explicitly defining its own parsing rules, which more closely match existing implementations and documents. It does, however, define an alternative <a href="XHTML">XHTML</a> serialization, which conforms to XML and therefore to SGML as well.

The second edition of the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" (OED) is entirely marked up with an SGML-based markup language using the <a href="LEXX%20%28text%20editor%29">LEXX (text editor)</a>

The third edition is marked up as XML.

Other document markup languages are partly related to SGML and XML, but—because they cannot be parsed or validated or other-wise processed using standard SGML and XML tools—they are not considered either SGML or XML languages; the <a href="Z%20Format">Z Format</a> markup language for typesetting and documentation is an example.

Several modern programming languages support tags as primitive token types, or now support Unicode and <a href="regular%20expression">regular expression</a> pattern-matching. An example is the <a href="Scala%20%28programming%20language%29">Scala programming language</a>.

Document markup languages defined using SGML are called "applications" by the standard; many pre-XML SGML applications were proprietary property of the organizations which developed them, and thus unavailable in the World Wide Web. The following list is of pre-XML SGML applications.


Significant <a href="open%20source%20software">open-source</a> implementations of SGML have included:

SP and Jade, the associated DSSSL processors, are maintained by the <a href="http%3A//openjade.sourceforge.net/">OpenJade</a> project, and are common parts of Linux distributions. A general archive of SGML software and materials resides at <a href="http%3A//ftp.sunet.se/pub/text-processing/sgml/">SUNET</a>. The original HTML parser class, in Sun System's implementation of Java, is a limited-features SGML parser, using SGML terminology and concepts.

32X

The 32X is an <a href="video%20game%20accessory">add-on</a> for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>. Codenamed "Project Mars", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">32-bit era</a> until the release of the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a>s and has its own <a href="List%20of%20Sega%2032X%20games">library of games</a>. The add-on was distributed under the name in Japan, Genesis 32X in North America, Mega Drive 32X in the <a href="PAL">PAL</a> region, and Mega 32X in Brazil.

Unveiled by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> at June 1994's <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful. The final design contained two 32-bit <a href="central%20processing%20units">central processing units</a> and a 3D graphics processor. To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party <a href="video%20game%20developer">video game developer</a>s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis <a href="porting">ports</a>. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units. After price reductions in 1995, it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.

The 32X is considered a <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.

The <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>, initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">16-bit era</a> of video game consoles. The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.

Although the earlier release of the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> add-on had been commercially disappointing, Sega began to develop a <a href="Improvisation">stop-gap</a> solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, serving as a less expensive entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">32-bit era</a>. The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama and broadly supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a> <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a>. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.

During the Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in January 1994, Sega of America <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the <a href="Sega%20Genesis%23Sega%20Virtua%20Processor">Sega Virtua Processor</a> chip. Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. But if the only thing it does is double the colors..." Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. This would come in the form of an add-on. From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed "Project Mars", was advanced.

At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit <a href="SuperH">SuperH</a>-2 processors. The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company <a href="Hitachi">Hitachi</a>. The original design for the 32X add-on, according to Bayless, was created on a cocktail napkin, but Miller insists that this was not the case. At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.

Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it "a coder's dream for the day" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities. Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan. Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.

Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America. Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously. Their answer was to call the 32X a "transitional device" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, "[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers."

The unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago. Promoted as the "poor man's entry into 'next generation' games", 32X was marketed for its <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn. However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software. Founder of <a href="The%203DO%20Company">The 3DO Company</a>, <a href="Trip%20Hawkins">Trip Hawkins</a>, was willing to point out that it would not, stating, "Everyone knows that 32X is a <a href="Band-Aid">Band-Aid</a>. It's not a 'next generation system.' It's fairly expensive. It's not particularly high-performance. It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn." In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.

In August of that year, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that "[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> systems and games from Japan. For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94." In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.

The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the <a href="Christmas%20holiday%20season">holiday season</a> that year. As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system. Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch. Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>", "<a href="Star%20Wars%20Arcade">Star Wars Arcade</a>", "<a href="Virtua%20Racing">Virtua Racing Deluxe</a>", and "<a href="Cosmic%20Carnage">Cosmic Carnage</a>". Although "Virtua Racing" was considered a "strong" title, "Cosmic Carnage" "looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it." Games were available at a retail price of $69.95. Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an "<a href="Arcade%20game">arcade</a> system". Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of <a href="Japanese%20yen">JP¥</a>16,800. The system's PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of <a href="Pound%20sterling">GB£</a>169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.

Despite the lower price console's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing <a href="third-party%20developer">third-party developer</a>s to create games for the new system. Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system. Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. According to Bayless, "games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of."

Journalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> and segmenting the market for its consoles. In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.

Though the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32X's third party publishers, including <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> and <a href="Konami">Konami</a>, cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation. The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>. By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995. Sega was supporting five different consoles before this—Saturn, Genesis, <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a>, <a href="Sega%20Pico">Pico</a>, and the <a href="Master%20System">Master System</a>—as well as the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons. Sales estimates for the 32X stood at 665,000 units at the end of 1994. Despite assurances from Sega that many games would be developed for the system, in early 1996, Sega finally conceded that it had promised too much out of the add-on and decided to discontinue the 32X in order to focus on the Saturn. In September 1995, the retail price for the 32X dropped to $99, and later the remaining inventory was cleared out of stores at $19.95.

The Sega Neptune is an unproduced two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega planned to release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned to be something less than US$200. Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced too close to the Saturn to be a viable competitor. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" used the Sega Neptune as an <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> prank in its <a href="EGM%20April%20Fools%27%20jokes%232001">April 2001 issue</a>. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for $199.

The 32X can be used only in conjunction with a Genesis system. It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge. The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis. As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons. The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the <a href="Sega%20Genesis%23First-party%20models">Sega Genesis CDX</a> system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of <a href="electric%20shock">electric shock</a> when the 32X and CDX were connected. Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis' cartridge slot.

Seated on top of a Genesis, the 32X measures . The 32X contains two Hitachi SH2 32-bit <a href="Reduced%20instruction%20set%20computing">RISC</a> processors with a clock speed of 23 <a href="hertz">MHz</a>, which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis. Its <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a> is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000 <a href="polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygons</a> per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis. The 32X also includes 256 <a href="kilobytes">kilobytes</a> of <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM), along with 256 kilobytes of <a href="VRAM">video RAM</a>. Sound is supplied through a <a href="pulse-width%20modulation">pulse-width modulation</a> sound source. <a href="Input/output">Input/output</a> is supplied to a television set via a provided <a href="audiovisual">A/V</a> cable that supplies <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> and <a href="stereo">stereo</a> audio, or through an <a href="RF%20modulator">RF modulator</a>. Stereo audio can also be played through <a href="headphones">headphones</a> via a <a href="Headphone%20Jack">headphone jack</a> on the attached Genesis.

The 32X's game library consists of forty titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games "<a href="Space%20Harrier">Space Harrier</a>" and "Star Wars Arcade", a <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">sidescroller</a> with a <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a> as a main character in "<a href="Kolibri%20%28video%20game%29">Kolibri</a>", and a 32X-exclusive game in the <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29">"Sonic the Hedgehog" series</a> titled "<a href="Knuckles%27%20Chaotix">Knuckles' Chaotix</a>". Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced <a href="Porting">ports</a> of Genesis games, including "<a href="After%20Burner">After Burner</a>", "<a href="NFL%20Quarterback%20Club">NFL Quarterback Club</a>", and "<a href="World%20Series%20Baseball%20%2795">World Series Baseball '95</a>". In a retrospective review of the console, "Star Wars Arcade" was considered the best game for the 32X by "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>". In a separate review, "IGN"'s Buchanan praised the 32X title "<a href="Shadow%20Squadron">Shadow Squadron</a>" as superior to "Star Wars Arcade". "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" writer Damien McFerran, however, praised "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28video%20game%29">Virtua Fighter</a>" as "the jewel in the 32X's crown", and "<a href="GamesRadar%2B">GamesRadar+</a>" named "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the best game for the system. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" called "Virtua Fighter" "the colorful wreath on 32X's coffin", reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32X's best release and a clear harbinger of the platform's imminent discontinuation, since it was clearly inferior to the Saturn versions of "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20Remix">Virtua Fighter Remix</a>" (which had already been released) and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%202">Virtua Fighter 2</a>" (which was due out in just a few months). In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of "Virtua Fighter 2".

Although the console used 32-bit processing and was capable of better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did not take advantage of its hardware. "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later criticized for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, jerky movement, and running within a <a href="Window%20%28computing%29">window</a> on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title "Cosmic Carnage", "We were rushed. We had to get games out for the 32X and it was going to be such a close cycle. When "Cosmic Carnage" showed up, we didn't even want to ship it. It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title." Likewise with "Doom", <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered."

Initial reception to the 32X and its games upon the launch of the add-on was very positive. Four reviewers from "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" scored the add-on 8, 7, 8, and 8 out of 10 in their 1995 Buyer's Guide, highlighting the add-on's enhancements to the Genesis but questioning how long the system would be supported. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" commented that the 32X's multiple input and power cords make it "as complicated as setting up your <a href="VCR">VCR</a>" and noted some performance glitches with the prototype such as <a href="Freeze%20%28computing%29">freezes</a> and overheating, but expressed confidence that the production models would perform well and gave the add-on their overall approval. Reviews of its launch titles, such as "Doom", were likewise positive. By late 1995, feedback to the add-on had soured. In its 1996 Buyer's Guide, "Electronic Gaming Monthly"'s four reviewers scored the add-on 3, 3, 3, and 2 out of 10, criticizing the game library and Sega's abandonment of the system in favor of the Saturn. A review in "Next Generation" panned the 32X for its weak polygon processing, the tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games, and its apparent function as "simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for Saturn". The review gave it one out of five stars.

Retrospectively, the 32X is widely criticized as having been under-supported and a poor idea in the wake of the release of the Sega Saturn. "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>"'s Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X "tainted just about everything it touched." "GamesRadar+" also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." "<nowiki>Retro Gamer'</nowiki>"s Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of "Space Harrier", "After Burner", and "Virtua Fighter" that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." Levi Buchanan, writing for "IGN", saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. According to Buchanan, "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one."

In particular, the console's status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. "<a href="Allgame">Allgame</a>"'s Scott Alan Marriott states that "[e]very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." "GamePro" criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. According to reviewer Blake Snow, "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if you were one of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." Writing for "GamesRadar+", Reparaz noted that "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." Writing for "IGN", Buchanan points out, "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience."

Former executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X. Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the <a href="Kinect">Kinect</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Move">PlayStation Move</a> for doing so. Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons."

Sega CD

The Sega CD, released as the in most regions outside North America and Brazil, is a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> <a href="video%20game%20accessory">accessory</a> for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a> designed and produced by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> as part of the <a href="fourth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">fourth generation of video game consoles</a>. It was released on December 12, 1991 in Japan, October 15, 1992 in North America, and 1993 in Europe. The Sega CD lets the user play CD-based games and adds hardware functionality such as a faster <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> and graphic enhancements. It can also play <a href="Compact%20disc">audio CD</a>s and <a href="CD%2BG">CD+G</a> discs.

The main benefit of CD technology was greater storage, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than Genesis cartridges. This benefit manifested as <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> (FMV) games such as the controversial "<a href="Night%20Trap">Night Trap</a>", which became a focus of the 1993 <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressional</a> hearings on issues of video game violence and ratings. Sega of Japan partnered with <a href="JVC">JVC</a> to design the Sega CD and refused to consult with Sega of America until the project was complete. Sega of America assembled parts from various "dummy" units to obtain a working prototype. It was redesigned a number of times by Sega and licensed third-party developers. 

While the Sega CD became known for several well-received games such as "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>" and "", its <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20CD%20games">game library</a> contained a large number of Genesis <a href="Port%20%28video%20gaming%29">ports</a> and poorly-received FMV games. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold by March 1996, after which Sega discontinued the system to focus on the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>. Retrospective reception is mixed, with praise for individual games and additional functions, but criticism for its lack of deep games, high price, and support from Sega.

Released in 1988, the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> (known as the Mega Drive in Europe and Japan) was Sega's entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">fourth generation</a> of video game consoles. In mid-1990, Sega <a href="CEO">CEO</a> <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a> hired <a href="Tom%20Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a> as CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: cut the console's price, develop games for the American market with a new American team, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and ship "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" with the Genesis as a <a href="pack-in%20game">pack-in game</a>. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it." Magazines praised "Sonic" as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (SNES) decided to purchase a Genesis instead.

By the early 1990s, compact discs were making significant headway as a <a href="data%20storage%20device">storage medium</a> for music and <a href="video%20games">video games</a>. <a href="NEC">NEC</a> had been the first to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their <a href="TurboGrafx-16%23TurboGrafx-CD">PC Engine CD-ROM² System</a> add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with <a href="Sony">Sony</a> to develop its own <a href="Super%20NES%20CD-ROM">CD-ROM peripheral</a> for the Super NES. <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a> released their CD-based <a href="CDTV">CDTV</a> multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting <a href="Philips%20CD-i">CD-i</a> from <a href="Philips">Philips</a> finally arrived towards the end of that year.

Shortly after the release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with creating a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM), and sell for about <a href="Japanese%20yen">JP¥</a>20,000 (or <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature <a href="2.5D">hardware</a> <a href="scaling%20%28geometry%29">scaling</a> and <a href="rotation">rotation</a> similar to that found in <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20arcade%20system%20boards">Sega's arcade</a> <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20arcade%20games">games</a>, which required the use of a dedicated <a href="digital%20signal%20processor">digital signal processor</a> (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 <a href="Megabit">Mbit</a> to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved to be one of the greatest technical challenges during development since the CD's access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with <a href="JVC">JVC</a>, which had been working with <a href="Warner%20Communications">Warner New Media</a> to develop a CD player under the <a href="CD%2BG">CD+G</a> standard, to develop the Sega CD.

Up until the middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a functioning unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," citing the need for games to use more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.

Sega announced the release of the Mega-CD in Japan for late 1991, and North America (as the Sega CD) in 1992. It was unveiled to the public for the first time at the 1991 Tokyo Toy Show, to positive reception from critics. The Mega-CD would go on to be released in Japan on December 12, 1991, initially retailing at <a href="Japanese%20yen">JP¥</a>49,800. Though the unit sold quickly, the small install base of the Mega Drive in Japan meant that sales declined rapidly after launch. Within its first year in Japan, the Mega-CD only sold 100,000 units. Third-party development of games for the new system suffered because Sega took a long amount of time to release software development kits. Other factors impacting sales included the high launch price of the Mega-CD in Japan and only two games available at launch.

On October 15, 1992, the Sega CD was released in North America, with a retail price of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>299. Advertising for the add-on included one of Sega's slogans, "Welcome to the Next Level". Though only 50,000 units were available at launch due to production issues, the add-on sold over 200,000 units by the end of 1992. As part of Sega's sales, <a href="Blockbuster%20LLC">Blockbuster LLC</a> purchased Sega CD units for rental in their stores. The Mega-CD was launched in Europe in the spring of 1993, starting with the United Kingdom on April 2, 1993, at a price of <a href="Pound%20sterling">GB£</a>269.99. The European version of the add-on was packaged with "<a href="Sol-Feace">Sol-Feace</a>" and "<a href="Cobra%20Command%20%281984%20video%20game%29">Cobra Command</a>" in a two-disc set, along with a <a href="Sega%20Classics%20Arcade%20Collection">compilation CD</a> of five existing Mega Drive games. Only 70,000 units were initially available in the UK, but 60,000 units were sold by August 1993. Emphasized by Sega of America, the benefits of the Sega CD's additional storage space allowed for a large amount of <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> (FMV) games to be published for the add-on, with <a href="Digital%20Pictures">Digital Pictures</a> becoming an important partner for Sega. After the initial competition between Sega and Nintendo to develop a CD-based add-on, Nintendo eventually canceled the development process of its own competing peripheral after having partnered with Sony and then with Philips to develop one.
Sega would go on to release the add-on's second model, the Sega CD 2 (Mega-CD 2), on April 23, 1993 in Japan at a price of JP¥29,800, It was released in North America several months later at the reduced retail price of US$229, with one of the system's best-selling games, "<a href="Sewer%20Shark">Sewer Shark</a>", as a pack-in. Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not contain the motorized disc tray used in the initial model. A limited number of games were also later developed that utilized both the Sega CD and the <a href="32X">32X</a> add-ons, the latter of which was released in November 1994.

On December 9, 1993, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> began to hold hearings on video game violence and the marketing of violent video games to children. One of the games at the center of this controversy was the Sega CD's "<a href="Night%20Trap">Night Trap</a>", a full-motion video adventure game by Digital Pictures. "Night Trap" had been brought to the attention of <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>, who said of the game, "I looked at that game, too, and there was a classic. It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. I know that the creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of <a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message." Lieberman's research later went on to conclude that the average video game player at the time was between seven and twelve years old and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children. Similar issues were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that ""Night Trap" got Sega an awful lot of publicity... Questions were even raised in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK Parliament</a> about its suitability. This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only served to reinforce that image." Although experiencing increased sales as a result of the hearings, Sega decided to recall "Night Trap" and re-release it with revisions in 1994. Following these hearings, video game manufacturers came together in 1994 to establish a unified rating system, eventually materializing in the form of the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> used in North America.

As time passed, the releases of new CD-based consoles such as the <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO Interactive Multiplayer</a> rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, less than a year after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Brain%20Dead%2013">Brain Dead 13</a>", were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.

The Sega CD can only be used in conjunction with a Genesis system, attaching through an expansion slot on the side of the main console. Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> CD+G discs, and can also be used in conjunction with the 32X to play <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis, as well as an extension spacer to work with <a href="Variations%20of%20the%20Mega%20Drive%23Mega%20Drive">the original model of the Genesis</a>.

The main <a href="Central%20Processing%20Unit">CPU</a> of the Sega CD is a 12.5<a href="Hertz">MHz</a> <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> processor, which runs 5 MHz faster than the Genesis processor. It contains 1 <a href="megabit">Mbit</a> of <a href="booting">boot</a> <a href="read-only%20memory">ROM</a>, allocated for the CD game <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a>, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of <a href="random-access%20memory">RAM</a> are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 <a href="kilobit">Kbit</a> to <a href="pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a> waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory in the form of a 1 <a href="Mbit">Mbit</a> Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two <a href="RCA%20connector">RCA pin jacks</a> allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.

Though the Sega CD offers a faster processor, its main purpose is to expand the size of the games. Whereas <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a>s of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, a CD-ROM disc can hold more than 640 <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a>s of data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge. This allows the Sega CD to run games containing full motion video.

The Sega CD received several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second model of the Sega CD, which was redesigned to sit next to the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.

Three additional system models were created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept it out of the hands of average consumers. Likewise was the case with the <a href="Pioneer%20LaserActive">Pioneer LaserActive</a>, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer Corporation</a>, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. <a href="Aiwa">Aiwa</a> also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a <a href="boombox">boombox</a>.

The Sega CD supports <a href="List%20of%20Sega%20CD%20games">a library of over 200 games</a> created both by Sega and an array of third-party publishers. Included in this library are six games which, while receiving individual Sega CD releases, also received separate versions that utilized both the Sega CD and 32X add-ons. Among the games released for the add-on were a number of FMV games, including "Sewer Shark" and "<a href="Fahrenheit%20%281995%20video%20game%29">Fahrenheit</a>". Well-regarded games include "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>", "" and "", "<a href="Popful%20Mail">Popful Mail</a>", and "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>", as well as the controversial "Night Trap". Although Sega created "<a href="Streets%20of%20Rage">Streets of Rage</a>" for the Genesis to compete against the SNES port of the arcade hit "<a href="Final%20Fight%20%28video%20game%29">Final Fight</a>", the Sega CD received an enhanced version of the latter game that has been praised for its greater faithfulness to the arcade original. "" was noted for its impressive use of the system's hardware as well as its violent content. In particular, "Sonic CD" garnered critical acclaim for its graphics and new <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> elements, which improved upon the traditional <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29">"Sonic"</a> formula. The Sega CD also received enhanced ports of games from the Genesis, such as "<a href="Batman%20Returns%20%28video%20game%29">Batman Returns</a>" and "<a href="Ecco%20the%20Dolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a>".

Given the large number of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD's game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. Full motion video quality was substandard on the Sega CD due to poor video compression software and the system's limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, "Sega CD could only put up 32 colors at a time, so you had this horrible grainy look to the images," though the system was able to put up 64 colors at one time. Likewise, most Genesis ports for the Sega CD featured additional full motion video sequences, extra levels, and enhanced audio, but were otherwise identical to their Genesis release. The video quality in these sequences has also been criticized as comparable to an old VHS tape.

Near the time of its release, the Sega CD was awarded Best New Peripheral of 1992 by <a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>. Four separate reviews scored the add-on 8, 9, 8, and 8 out of 10; reviewers cited its upgrades to the Genesis as well as its high-quality and expanding library of games. Later reception in 1995 by Electronic Gaming Monthly showed a more mixed response to the peripheral, with four reviewers scoring it 5 out of 10, citing its game library issues and substandard video quality. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" also criticized the weak games library and substandard video quality, noting that many of the games were simple ports of cartridge games with minimal enhancements and commenting that "The Sega CD could have been an upgrade, but it's essentially a big memory device with CD sound." They gave it a "thumbs sideways" and recommended that Genesis fans buy an <a href="SNES">SNES</a> before even considering a Sega CD. Likewise, in a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, "<a href="Famitsu">Famicom Tsūshin</a>" scored the Japanese Mega-CD 2 a 17 out of 40.

Retrospective reception of the Sega CD is mixed, praising certain games but criticizing its low value for money and limitations on the benefits it provides to the Genesis. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" listed the Sega CD as the 7th-worst selling video game console of all time, with reviewer Blake Snow noting that "The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn't do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience." Snow went on to note, however, that the Sega CD did have in its library "the greatest "Sonic" game of all time" in "Sonic CD". <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Levi Buchanan criticized Sega's implementation of CD technology for the Genesis, noting, "What good is the extra storage space if there is nothing inventive to be done with it? No new gameplay concepts emerged from the SEGA CD—it just offered more of the same. In fact, with few exceptions like "Sonic CD", it often offered some of the 16-bit generation's worst games, like "<a href="Demolition%20Man%20%28video%20game%29">Demolition Man</a>"." Jeremy Parish of USgamer pointed out that "Sega was hardly the only company to muddy its waters with a CD add-on in the early '90s" and highlighted some "gems" for the system, but cautioned "the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against the fact that the add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [Genesis]." Writing for "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>", Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD's limited sales, including the add-on's high price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis console, and lack of ability to function without a console attached. "Retro Gamer" writer Aaron Birch, however, defended the Sega CD and wrote that "the single biggest cause of the Mega-CD's failure was the console itself. When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time."

The poor support for the Sega CD has often been criticized as the first link in the devaluation of the Sega brand. Writing for IGN, Buchanan described an outside perspective on Sega's decision to release the Sega CD with its poor library and console support, stating, "[T]he SEGA CD instead looked like a strange, desperate move—something designed to nab some ink but without any real, thought-out strategy. Genesis owners that invested in the add-on were sorely disappointed, which undoubtedly helped sour the non-diehards on the brand." In reviewing for "GamePro", Snow commented that "[the] Sega CD marked the first of several Sega systems that saw very poor support; something that devalued the once-popular Sega brand in the eyes of consumers, and something that would ultimately lead to the company's demise as a hardware maker."

Former Sega of America senior producer Scot Bayless attributes the unsuccessful market to a lack of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company fell in love with the idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was. I am afraid I cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success."

Sega Saturn

The is a <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">fifth-generation</a> <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> developed by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> and released on November 22, 1994 in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, May 11, 1995 in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, and July 8, 1995 in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. The successor to the successful <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>, the Saturn has a dual-<a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> architecture and eight processors. Its games are in <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format, and its game library contains several <a href="Arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="Porting">ports</a> as well as original games.

Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="Sega%20Model%201">Model 1</a> <a href="Arcade%20system%20board">arcade hardware</a> debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company <a href="Hitachi">Hitachi</a>, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s forthcoming <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>.

The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series, known in development as "<a href="Sonic%20X-treme">Sonic X-treme</a>", has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.

Although the Saturn is remembered for several well-regarded games, including "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams">Nights into Dreams</a>", the "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20%28series%29">Panzer Dragoon</a>" series, and the "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28series%29">Virtua Fighter</a>" series, its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited <a href="third-party%20developer">third-party</a> support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system's development and discontinuation.

Released in 1988, the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> (known as the Mega Drive in Europe, Japan and Australia) was Sega's entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">fourth generation</a> of video game consoles. In mid-1990, Sega CEO <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a> hired <a href="Tom%20Kalinske">Tom Kalinske</a> as president and CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: lower the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and sell "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" with the console. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it." Magazines praised "Sonic" as one of the greatest games ever made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (SNES) decided to purchase a Genesis instead. However, the release of a CD-based <a href="Video%20game%20accessory">add-on</a> for the Genesis, the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> (known as Mega-CD outside of North America), was commercially disappointing.

Sega also experienced success with <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a>s. In 1992 and 1993, the new <a href="Sega%20Model%201%23Sega%20Model%201">Sega Model 1</a> arcade system board showcased <a href="Sega%20AM2">Sega AM2</a>'s "<a href="Virtua%20Racing">Virtua Racing</a>" and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20%28video%20game%29">Virtua Fighter</a>" (the first <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a>), which played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, "Virtua Fighter" garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a> of <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—"Virtua Fighter"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>. The Model 1 was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the <a href="Sega%20Genesis%23Sega%20Virtua%20Processor">Sega Virtua Processor</a> chip used for "Virtua Racing", and eventually the <a href="Sega%2032X">Sega 32X</a> add-on.

Development of the Saturn was supervised by Hideki Sato, Sega's director and deputy general manager of <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a>. According to Sega project manager Hideki Okamura, the Saturn project started over two years before the system was showcased at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994. The name "Saturn" was the system's codename during development in Japan, but was chosen as the official product name. "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" in March 1994 reported a rumor that "the Sega "Saturn" ... will release in Japan before the end of the year" for $250–300.

In 1993, Sega and Japanese electronics company <a href="Hitachi">Hitachi</a> formed a joint venture to develop a new CPU for the Saturn, which resulted in the creation of the "SuperH <a href="Reduced%20instruction%20set%20computing">RISC</a> Engine" (or <a href="SuperH">SH-2</a>) later that year. The Saturn was designed around a dual-SH2 configuration. According to Kazuhiro Hamada, Sega's section chief for Saturn development during the system's conception, "the SH-2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency. The chip has a calculation system similar to a <a href="Digital%20Signal%20Processor">DSP</a> [digital signal processor], but we realized that a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world." Although the Saturn's design was largely finished before the end of 1993, reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s upcoming <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> console prompted Sega to include another video display processor (VDP) to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping. CD-ROM-based and cartridge-only versions of the Saturn hardware were considered for simultaneous release during the system's development, but this idea was discarded due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge-based games.

According to Kalinske, Sega of America "fought against the architecture of Saturn for quite some time". Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn, Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a>, but Sega of Japan rejected the proposal. Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>. Kalinske, Sony Electronic Publishing's <a href="%C3%93lafur%20J%C3%B3hann%20%C3%93lafsson">Olaf Olafsson</a>, and Sony America's Micky Schulhof had discussed development of a joint "Sega/Sony hardware system", which never came to fruition due to Sega's desire to create hardware that could accommodate both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony's competing notion of focusing on 3D technology. Publicly, Kalinske defended the Saturn's design: "Our people feel that they need the multiprocessing to be able to bring to the home what we're doing next year in the arcades."

In 1993, Sega restructured its internal studios in preparation for the Saturn's launch. To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to create a more energetic working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a>" developer <a href="Team%20Andromeda">Team Andromeda</a>, were formed during this time.

In January 1994, Sega began to develop an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega 32X, which would serve as a less expensive entry into the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fifth%20generation%29">32-bit era</a>. The decision to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch by the end of the year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis games, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X served a role in assisting development teams to familiarize themselves with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.

Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, at a price of <a href="Japanese%20yen">¥</a>44,800. "Virtua Fighter", a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan. Though Sega had wanted to launch with "<a href="Clockwork%20Knight">Clockwork Knight</a>" and "Panzer Dragoon," the only other first-party game available at launch was "Wan Chai Connection". Fueled by the popularity of "Virtua Fighter", Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn proved more popular.

Meanwhile, Sega released the 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at less than half of the Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher <a href="sell-through">sell-through</a> rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet <a href="demand">demand</a> more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week <a href="lead%20time">lead time</a>s for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.

In March 1995, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the U.S. on "Saturnday" (Saturday) September 2, 1995.<ref name="Saturnday/1:1"></ref> However, Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation. At the first <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) in Los Angeles on May 11, 1995, Kalinske gave a keynote presentation in which he revealed the release price of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>399 (including a copy of "Virtua Fighter"), and described the features of the console. Kalinske also revealed that, due to "high consumer demand", Sega had already shipped 30,000 Saturns to <a href="Toys%20%26quot%3BR%26quot%3B%20Us">Toys "R" Us</a>, <a href="Babbage%27s">Babbage's</a>, <a href="Electronics%20Boutique">Electronics Boutique</a>, and <a href="Software%20Etc.">Software Etc.</a> for immediate release. The announcement upset retailers who were not informed of the surprise release, including <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a> and <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a>; <a href="KB%20Toys">KB Toys</a> responded by dropping Sega from its lineup. Sony subsequently unveiled the retail price for the PlayStation: <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> America president Steve Race took the stage, said "$299", and then walked away to applause. The Saturn's release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date, on July 8, 1995, at a price of <a href="Pound%20sterling">₤</a>399.99. European retailers and press did not have time to promote the system or its games, harming sales. After the PlayStation's European launch on September 29, it had already outsold the Saturn by a factor of three in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> by early November 1995, where it was reported that Sony allocated ₤20 million to market the system during the holiday season compared to Sega's ₤4 million.

The Saturn's U.S. launch was accompanied by a reported $50 million advertising campaign that included coverage in publications such as "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" and "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>". Early advertising for the system was targeted at a more mature, adult audience than the Sega Genesis ads. Because of the early launch, the Saturn had only six games (all published by Sega) available to start as most third-party games were slated to be released around the original launch date. "Virtua Fighter"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s relative lack of popularity in the West, combined with a release schedule of only two games between the surprise launch and September 1995, prevented Sega from capitalizing on the Saturn's early timing. Within two days of its September 9, 1995 launch in North America, the PlayStation (backed by a large marketing campaign) sold more units than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch, with almost all of the initial shipment of 100,000 units being sold in advance, and the rest selling out across the U.S.

A high-quality port of the <a href="Namco">Namco</a> arcade game "<a href="Ridge%20Racer%20%28video%20game%29">Ridge Racer</a>" contributed to the PlayStation's early success, and garnered favorable media in comparison to the Saturn version of Sega's "<a href="Daytona%20USA%20%28video%20game%29">Daytona USA</a>", which was considered inferior to its arcade counterpart. Namco, a longtime arcade competitor with Sega, also unveiled the <a href="Namco%20System%2011">Namco System 11</a> arcade board, based on raw PlayStation hardware. Although the System 11 was technically inferior to Sega's <a href="Sega%20Model%202">Model 2</a> arcade board, its lower price made it attractive to smaller arcades. Following a 1994 acquisition of Sega developers, Namco released "<a href="Tekken%20%28video%20game%29">Tekken</a>" for the System 11 and PlayStation. Directed by former "Virtua Fighter" designer <a href="Seiichi%20Ishii">Seiichi Ishii</a>, "Tekken" was intended to be fundamentally similar, with the addition of detailed textures and twice the <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>. "Tekken" surpassed "Virtua Fighter" in popularity due to its superior graphics and nearly arcade-perfect console port, becoming the first million-selling PlayStation game.

On October 2, 1995 Sega announced a Saturn price reduction to $299. High-quality Saturn ports of the Sega Model 2 arcade hits "<a href="Sega%20Rally%20Championship">Sega Rally Championship</a>", "<a href="Virtua%20Cop">Virtua Cop</a>", and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%202">Virtua Fighter 2</a>" (running at 60 frames per second at a high resolution) were available by the end of the year, and were generally regarded as superior to competitors on the PlayStation. Notwithstanding a subsequent increase in Saturn sales during the 1995 holiday season, the games were not enough to reverse the PlayStation's decisive lead. By 1996, the PlayStation had a considerably larger library than the Saturn, although Sega hoped to generate interest with upcoming exclusives such as "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams">Nights into Dreams</a>". An informal survey of retailers showed that the Saturn and PlayStation sold in roughly equal numbers during the first quarter of 1996. Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20% of the entire U.S. video game market. On the first day of the May 1996 E3 show, Sony announced a PlayStation price reduction to $199, a reaction to the release of the Model 2 Saturn in Japan at a price roughly equivalent to $199. On the second day, Sega announced it would match this price, though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture.

In spite of the launch of the PlayStation and the Saturn, sales of 16-bit hardware/software continued to account for 64% of the video game market in 1995. Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis, and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product. Sega was able to capture 43% of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and sell more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995, but Kalinske estimated that "we could have sold another 300,000 Genesis systems in the November/December timeframe." Nakayama's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis, based on the systems' relative performance in Japan, has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation.

Due to long-standing disagreements with Sega of Japan, Kalinske lost most of his interest in his work as CEO of Sega of America. By the spring of 1996, rumors were circulating that Kalinske planned to leave Sega, and a July 13 article in the press reported speculation that Sega of Japan was planning significant changes to Sega of America's management team. On July 16, 1996, Sega announced that <a href="Shoichiro%20Irimajiri">Shoichiro Irimajiri</a> had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America, while Kalinske would be leaving Sega after September 30 of that year. A former <a href="Honda">Honda</a> executive, Irimajiri had been actively involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993. Sega also announced that <a href="David%20Rosen%20%28business%29">David Rosen</a> and Nakayama had resigned from their positions as chairman and co-chairman of Sega of America, though both men remained with the company. <a href="Bernie%20Stolar">Bernie Stolar</a>, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was named Sega of America's executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations. Stolar, who had arranged a six-month PlayStation exclusivity deal for "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%203">Mortal Kombat 3</a>" and helped build close relations with <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> while at Sony, was perceived as a major asset by Sega officials. Finally, Sega of America made plans to expand its PC software business.

Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed, and publicly announced at E3 1997 that "The Saturn is not our future." While Stolar had "no interest in lying to people" about the Saturn's prospects, he continued to emphasize quality games for the system, and subsequently reflected that "we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer." At Sony, Stolar opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation games that he felt would not represent the system well in North America, and advocated a similar policy for the Saturn during his time at Sega, although he later sought to distance himself from this perception. These changes were accompanied by a softer image that Sega was beginning to portray in its advertising, including removing the "Sega!" scream and holding press events for the education industry. Marketing for the Saturn in Japan also changed with the introduction of "<a href="Segata%20Sanshiro">Segata Sanshiro</a>" (played by <a href="Hiroshi%20Fujioka">Hiroshi Fujioka</a>) as a character in a series of TV advertisements starting in 1997; the character would eventually star in a Saturn video game.

Temporarily abandoning arcade development, Sega AM2 head <a href="Yu%20Suzuki">Yu Suzuki</a> began developing several Saturn-exclusive games, including a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> in the "Virtua Fighter" series. Initially conceived as an obscure prototype "The Old Man and the Peach Tree" and intended to address the flaws of contemporary Japanese RPGs (such as poor <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a> <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> routines), "Virtua Fighter RPG" evolved into a planned 11-part, 45-hour "revenge epic in the tradition of <a href="Cinema%20of%20China">Chinese cinema</a>", which Suzuki hoped would become the Saturn's <a href="killer%20app">killer app</a>. The game was eventually released as "<a href="Shenmue%20%28video%20game%29">Shenmue</a>" for the Saturn's successor, the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>.

As <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> was working on "Nights into Dreams", Sega tasked the U.S.-based <a href="Sega%20Technical%20Institute">Sega Technical Institute</a> (STI) with developing what would have been the first fully 3D entry in its popular "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series. The game, "<a href="Sonic%20X-treme">Sonic X-treme</a>", was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a <a href="fisheye%20lens">fisheye lens</a> camera system that rotated levels with <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a>'s movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the <a href="Game%20engine">engine</a> created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development time proved fruitless after Stolar rescinded STI's access to Sonic Team's "Nights into Dreams" engine following an ultimatum by "Nights" programmer <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a>. After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designers <a href="Chris%20Senn%20%28video%20game%20designer%29">Chris Senn</a> and Chris Coffin became ill, the project was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D "Sonic" game for the Saturn, but development was shifted to the Dreamcast and the game became "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>". STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.

Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact a completed "X-treme" might have had on the market. David Houghton of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> described the prospect of "a good 3D "Sonic" game" on the Saturn as "a 'What if...' situation on a par with the dinosaurs not becoming extinct." <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Tavis Fahs called "X-treme" "the turning point not only for Sega's mascot and their 32-bit console, but for the entire company", but noted that the game served as "an empty vessel for Sega's ambitions and the hopes of their fans". Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan website during the system's lifespan, said: "I don't know if ["X-treme"] could've saved the Saturn, but ... "Sonic" helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn't a great new "Sonic" title ready at or near the launch of the [Saturn]". In a 2007 retrospective, producer Mike Wallis maintained that "X-treme" "definitely would have been competitive" with Nintendo's "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>". By contrast, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" reported in late 1996 that the game did not compare well to contemporary competition, and would have harmed Sega's reputation if it had been completed and released. Naka stated that he was relieved by the cancellation, as the game "wasn't looking very good from my perspective".

From 1993 to early 1996, although Sega's revenue declined as part of an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive <a href="price%20war">price war</a>, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million Saturn units sold. The Christmas 1996 "Three Free" pack, which bundled the Saturn with "Daytona USA", "Virtua Fighter 2", and "Virtua Cop," drove sales dramatically and ensured the Saturn remained a competitor into 1997.

However, the Saturn failed to take the lead. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and its games were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. in 1997. The 1997 release of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo 40%, and Sega only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases proved helpful. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997.

As a result of Sega's deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as president in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar subsequently acceded to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the <a href="Tokyo%20Stock%20Exchange">Tokyo Stock Exchange</a>. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million).

Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega announced that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 ("<a href="Magic%20Knight%20Rayearth%20%28video%20game%29">Magic Knight Rayearth</a>" was the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce.

Worldwide Saturn sales include at least the following amounts in each territory: 5.75 million in Japan (surpassing the Genesis' sales of 3.58 million there), 1.8 million in the United States, 1 million in Europe, and 530,000 elsewhere. With lifetime sales of 9.26 million units, the Saturn is considered a <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>, although its install base in Japan surpassed the Nintendo 64's 5.54 million. Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor contributing to the Saturn's failure, as the system's surprise launch damaged Sega's reputation with key retailers. Conversely, Nintendo's long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage caused to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis are considered major factors allowing Sony to gain a foothold in the market.

Featuring a total of eight processors the Saturn's main <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a>s are two Hitachi SH-2 <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s <a href="Clock%20rate">clocked</a> at 28.6 <a href="Hertz">MHz</a> and capable of 56 <a href="Instructions%20per%20second">MIPS</a>. The system contains a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68EC000</a> running at 11.3 MHz as a sound controller, a custom <a href="Sound%20chip">sound processor</a> with an integrated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6 MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both <a href="Frequency%20modulation%20synthesis">FM synthesis</a> and <a href="Audio%20bit%20depth">16-bit</a> <a href="Pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a> <a href="Sampling%20%28signal%20processing%29">sampling</a> at a maximum <a href="Sampling%20rate">rate</a> of <a href="44%2C100%20Hz">44.1 kHz</a>, and two <a href="Graphics%20processing%20unit">video display processors</a>, the VDP1 (which handles sprites, <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a> and <a href="Polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygons</a>) and the VDP2 (which handles backgrounds). Its double-speed <a href="Optical%20disc%20drive">CD-ROM drive</a> is controlled by a dedicated <a href="SuperH">Hitachi SH-1</a> processor to reduce load times. The Saturn's System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all <a href="Bus%20%28computing%29">buses</a> and functions as a co-processor of the main SH-2 CPU, has an internal DSP running at 14.3 MHz. The Saturn contains a cartridge slot for memory expansion, 16 <a href="Megabit">Mbit</a> of work <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM), 12 Mbit of <a href="VRAM">video RAM</a>, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions, 4 Mbit of CD <a href="Data%20buffer">buffer</a> RAM and 256 <a href="Kilobit">Kbit</a> (32 KB) of <a href="Saved%20game">battery backup</a> RAM. Its video output, provided by a <a href="RCA%20connector">stereo AV cable</a>, displays at <a href="Display%20resolution">resolutions</a> from 320×224 to 704×224 <a href="pixel">pixel</a>s, and is capable of displaying up to <a href="Color%20depth%23True%20color%20%2824-bit%29">16.77 million</a> <a href="List%20of%20color%20palettes">colors</a> simultaneously. Physically, the Saturn measures . The Saturn was sold packaged with an instruction manual, one control pad, a stereo AV cable, and its 100V AC power supply, with a power consumption of approximately 15W.

The Saturn had technically impressive hardware at the time of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4 kB of <a href="CPU%20cache">cache memory</a> in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, "Virtua Fighter" used one CPU for each character, while "Nights" used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.

The Saturn's design elicited mixed commentary among game developers and journalists. Developers quoted by "Next Generation" in December 1995 described the Saturn as "a real coder's machine" for "those who love to get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with "more flexibility" and "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, <a href="Lobotomy%20Software">Lobotomy Software</a> programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas <a href="Kenji%20Eno">Kenji Eno</a> of <a href="Superwarp">WARP</a> observed little difference between the two systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of <a href="quadrilateral">quadrilateral</a>s as its basic <a href="geometric%20primitive">geometric primitive</a>, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of <a href="Time%20Warner%20Interactive">Time Warner Interactive</a> remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful <a href="Library%20%28computing%29">software libraries</a> and <a href="Programming%20tool">development tools</a>, requiring developers to write in <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a> to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulate</a>. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, <a href="Treasure%20%28company%29">Treasure</a> CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. <a href="Traveller%27s%20Tales">Traveller's Tales</a>' <a href="Jon%20Burton">Jon Burton</a> opined that while the PlayStation was easier "to get started on ... you quickly reach [its] limits", whereas the Saturn's "complicated" hardware had the ability to "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated "Geometry Transfer Engine" that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an "essentially" 2D system.

Several models of the Saturn were produced in Japan. An updated model in a recolored light gray (officially white) was released in Japan at a price of ¥20,000 in order to reduce the system's cost and raise its appeal among women and younger children. Two models were released by third parties: Hitachi released a model known as the Hi-Saturn (a smaller Saturn model equipped with a car navigation function), while <a href="JVC">JVC</a> released the V-Saturn. Saturn controllers came in various color schemes to match different models of the console. The system also supports several accessories. A wireless controller powered by AA batteries utilizes infrared signal to connect to the Saturn. Designed to work with "Nights", the Saturn <a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams...%23Release">3D Pad</a> includes both a control pad and an analog stick for directional input. Sega also released several versions of arcade sticks as peripherals, including the Virtua Stick, the Virtua Stick Pro, the Mission Analog Stick, and the Twin Stick. Sega also created a <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> peripheral known as the "Virtua Gun" for use with shooting games such as "Virtua Cop" and "The Guardian", as well as the Arcade Racer, a wheel for racing games. The Play Cable allows for two Saturn consoles to be connected for multiplayer gaming across two screens, while a multitap allows up to six players to play games on the same console. The Saturn was designed to support up to 12 players on a single console, by using two multitaps. RAM cartridges expand the amount of memory in the system. Other accessories include a keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, and movie card.

Like the Genesis, the Saturn had an Internet-based gaming service. The <a href="Sega%20NetLink">Sega NetLink</a> was a 28.8k <a href="modem">modem</a> that fit into the cartridge slot in the Saturn for direct dial multiplayer. In Japan, a now defunct pay-to-play service was used. It could also be used for <a href="web%20browsing">web browsing</a>, sending <a href="email">email</a>, and <a href="online%20chat">online chat</a>. Because the NetLink was released before the Saturn keyboard, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses so that Saturn owners could browse with the joypad. The NetLink functioned with five games: "Daytona USA", "<a href="Duke%20Nukem%203D">Duke Nukem 3D</a>", "<a href="Saturn%20Bomberman">Saturn Bomberman</a>", "Sega Rally", and "". In 1995 Sega announced it was developing a variant of the Saturn featuring a built-in NetLink modem under the code name "Sega Pluto", but it was never released.

Sega developed an arcade board based on the Saturn's hardware, called the <a href="Sega%20ST-V">Sega ST-V</a> (or Titan), which was intended as an affordable alternative to Sega's Model 2 arcade board as well as a testing ground for upcoming Saturn software. The Titan was criticized for its comparatively weak performance by Sega AM2's Yu Suzuki and was overproduced by Sega's arcade division. Because Sega already possessed the "<a href="Die%20Hard%20%28film%20series%29">Die Hard</a>" license, members of <a href="Sega%20AM1">Sega AM1</a> working at the Sega Technical Institute developed "<a href="Die%20Hard%20Arcade">Die Hard Arcade</a>" for the Titan to clear out excess inventory. "Die Hard" became the most successful Sega arcade game produced in the United States at that point. Other games released for the Titan include "" and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%20Kids">Virtua Fighter Kids</a>".

Much of the Saturn's library comes from Sega's arcade ports, including "Daytona USA", "<a href="The%20House%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28video%20game%29">The House of the Dead</a>", "<a href="Last%20Bronx">Last Bronx</a>", "Sega Rally Championship", the "Virtua Cop" series, the "Virtua Fighter" series, and "Virtual-On". Saturn ports of 2D <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> fighting games including "<a href="Darkstalkers%203">Darkstalkers 3</a>", "<a href="Marvel%20Super%20Heroes%20vs.%20Street%20Fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>", and "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20Alpha%203">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a>" were noted for their faithfulness to their arcade counterparts. "<a href="Fighters%20Megamix">Fighters Megamix</a>", developed by Sega AM2 for the Saturn rather than arcades, combined characters from "<a href="Fighting%20Vipers">Fighting Vipers</a>" and "Virtua Fighter" to positive reviews. Highly rated Saturn exclusives include "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20Saga">Panzer Dragoon Saga</a>", "<a href="Dragon%20Force">Dragon Force</a>", "<a href="Guardian%20Heroes">Guardian Heroes</a>", "Nights", "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon%20II%20Zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>", and "<a href="Shining%20Force%20III">Shining Force III</a>". PlayStation games such as "", "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>", and "<a href="Wipeout%202097">Wipeout 2097</a>" received Saturn ports with mixed results. Lobotomy Software's "<a href="PowerSlave">PowerSlave</a>" featured some of the most impressive 3D graphics on the system, leading Sega to contract them to produce Saturn ports of "Duke Nukem 3D" and "<a href="Quake%20%28video%20game%29">Quake</a>". While Electronic Arts' limited support for the Saturn and Sega's failure to develop a football game for the 1996 fall season gave Sony the lead in the sports genre, "Sega Sports" published Saturn sports games including the well-regarded "<a href="World%20Series%20Baseball%20%28video%20game%29">World Series Baseball</a>" and "<a href="Sega%20Worldwide%20Soccer">Sega Worldwide Soccer</a>" series. With about 600 official releases, the Saturn's library is nearly twice as large as the Nintendo 64's.

Due to the cancellation of "Sonic X-treme", the Saturn lacks an exclusive "Sonic the Hedgehog" platformer; instead it received a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis game "<a href="Sonic%203D%20Blast">Sonic 3D Blast</a>", the compilation "<a href="Sonic%20Jam">Sonic Jam</a>", and a racing game, "<a href="Sonic%20R">Sonic R</a>". The platformer "<a href="Bug%21">Bug!</a>" received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the "Sonic" series had. Considered one of the most important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed "Nights into Dreams", a <a href="Score%20%28game%29">score attack</a> game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of "Nights" involves steering the <a href="imp">imp</a>-like <a href="Androgyny">androgynous</a> protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's "Super Mario 64", "Nights"<nowiki>'</nowiki> emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's "<a href="Burning%20Rangers">Burning Rangers</a>", a fully 3D <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> involving a team of outer-space <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a>s, garnered praise for its <a href="Transparency%20%28graphic%29">transparency</a> effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.

Some of the games that made the Saturn popular in Japan, such as "<a href="Grandia%20%28video%20game%29">Grandia</a>" and the "<a href="Sakura%20Wars">Sakura Wars</a>" series, never saw a Western release due to Sega of America's policy of not localizing RPGs and other Japanese games that might have damaged the system's reputation in North America. Despite appearing first on the Saturn, games such as "<a href="Dead%20or%20Alive%20%28video%20game%29">Dead or Alive</a>", "Grandia", and "" only saw a Western release on the PlayStation. <a href="Working%20Designs">Working Designs</a> localized several Japanese Saturn games before a public feud between Sega of America's Bernie Stolar and Working Designs president Victor Ireland resulted in the company switching their support to the PlayStation. "Panzer Dragoon Saga" was praised as perhaps the finest RPG for the system due to its cinematic presentation, evocative plot, and unique battle system—with a tactical emphasis on circling around opponents to identify weak points and the ability to "morph" the physical attributes of the protagonist's dragon companion during combat—but Sega released fewer than 20,000 retail copies of the game in North America in what IGN's Levi Buchanan characterized as one example of the Saturn's "ignominious send-off" in the region. Similarly, only the first of three installments of "Shining Force III" was released outside Japan. The Saturn's library also garnered criticism for its lack of sequels to high-profile Genesis-era Sega franchises, with Sega of Japan's cancellation of a planned third installment in Sega of America's popular "<a href="Eternal%20Champions">Eternal Champions</a>" series cited as a significant source of controversy.

Later ports of Saturn games including "Guardian Heroes", "Nights", and "" continued to garner positive reviews. Partly due to rarity, Saturn games such as "Panzer Dragoon Saga" and "<a href="Radiant%20Silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>" have been noted for their <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>. Due to the system's commercial failure and hardware limitations, planned Saturn releases such as "<a href="Resident%20Evil%202">Resident Evil 2</a>", "Shenmue", "Sonic Adventure", and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%203">Virtua Fighter 3</a>" were cancelled and moved to the Dreamcast.

At the time of its release, "<a href="Famicom%20Ts%C5%ABshin">Famicom Tsūshin</a>" awarded the Saturn console 24 out of 40 possible points, higher than the PlayStation's 19 out of 40. In June 1995, Dennis Lynch of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" and Albert Kim of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" both praised the Saturn as the most advanced gaming console available, with the former complimenting its double-speed CD-ROM drive and "intense surround-sound capabilities" and the latter citing "Panzer Dragoon" as a "lyrical and exhilarating epic" demonstrating the ability of new technology to "transform" the industry. In December 1995, "Next Generation" evaluated the system with three and a half stars out of a possible five, highlighting Sega's marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system's complexity as a weakness. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s December 1996 Buyer's Guide had four reviewers rate the Saturn 8, 6, 7, and 8 out of 10; these ratings were inferior to those of the PlayStation, which was scored 9, 10, 9, and 9 in the same review. By December 1998, "Electronic Gaming Monthly"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviews were more mixed, with reviewers citing the lack of games for the system as a major issue. According to "EGM" reviewer Crispin Boyer, "the Saturn is the only system that can thrill me one month and totally disappoint me the next".

Retrospective feedback of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library. According to Greg Sewart of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, "the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time". In 2009, IGN named the Saturn as the 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, "While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo ... "Nights into Dreams", the "Virtua Fighter" and "Panzer Dragoon" series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" noted "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like "Burning Rangers", "Guardian Heroes", "Dragon Force" and "Panzer Dragoon Saga"." In 2015, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Keith Stuart declared "the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history".

"<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Damien McFerran stated "Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it." IGN's Adam Redsell wrote "[Sega's] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the <a href="Indie%20game">indie scene</a> today." Necrosoft Games director <a href="Brandon%20Sheffield">Brandon Sheffield</a> expounded that "The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan ... some games, like "<a href="Enemy%20Zero">Enemy Zero</a>" used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served." Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party games as "Sega's shining moment as a game developer", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of "fresh ideas" and "precious few high-profile franchises", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.

Criticism has befallen Sega's management regarding both the creation and handling of the Saturn. McFerran criticizes Sega's management at the time of the Saturn's development, claiming that it had "fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry". Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to end support for the Saturn. According to Fahs, "Stolar's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but ... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar's redemption." Stolar has defended his decision, stating, "I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren't going to win." Sheffield stated that the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals undermined third-party support for the system, but because "<a href="Nvidia">nVidia</a> invested in quads" at the same time there is "a remote possibility" they could have "become the standard instead of triangles"—"if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era." Speaking more positively of the system, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as "the start of the future of console gaming" because it "got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time". Writing for <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>, Justin Towell noted that the Saturn's 3D Pad "set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog <a href="shoulder%20triggers">shoulder triggers</a> and left thumbstick ... I don't see any three-pronged controllers around the office these days."

Douglass C. Perry of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> notes that, from its surprise launch to its ultimate failure, the Saturn "soured many gamers on Sega products." Sewart and IGN's Levi Buchanan cited the failure of the Saturn as the major reason for Sega's downfall as a hardware manufacturer, but USgamer's Jeremy Parish described the Saturn as "more a symptom ... than a cause" of the company's decline, which began with add-ons for the Genesis that fragmented the market and continued with Sega of America's and Sega of Japan's competing designs for the Dreamcast. Sheffield portrayed Sega's mistakes with the Saturn as emblematic of the broader decline of the Japanese gaming industry: "They thought they were invincible, and that structure and hierarchy were necessary for their survival, but more flexibility, and a greater participation with the West could have saved them." According to Stuart, Sega "didn't see ... the roots of a prevailing trend, away from arcade conversions and traditional role-playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure." Pulp365 reviews editor Matt Paprocki concluded "the Saturn is a relic, but an important one, which represents the harshness of progress and what it can leave in its wake".

Stonewall riots

The Stonewall riots (also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the <a href="LGBT%20community">gay (LGBT) community</a> against a <a href="police%20raid">police raid</a> that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the <a href="Stonewall%20Inn">Stonewall Inn</a> in the <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> neighborhood of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the <a href="gay%20liberation">gay liberation</a> movement and the modern fight for <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">LGBT rights in the United States</a>.

Gay Americans in the 1950s and 1960s faced an anti-gay legal system. Early <a href="homophile">homophile</a> groups in the U.S. sought to prove that gay people could be assimilated into society, and they favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a>s alike. The last years of the 1960s, however, were very contentious, as many social/political movements were active, including the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture of the 1960s</a>, and the <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">anti–Vietnam War movement</a>. These influences, along with the liberal environment of Greenwich Village, served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.

Very few establishments welcomed openly gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the <a href="American%20Mafia">Mafia</a>. It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>s, <a href="transgender">transgender</a> people, <a href="effeminate">effeminate</a> young men, <a href="Butch%20and%20femme">butch lesbians</a>, <a href="male%20prostitution">male prostitutes</a>, and <a href="Homelessness%20in%20the%20United%20States">homeless youth</a>. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">New York City police</a> and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gays and lesbians to be open about their <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a> without fear of being arrested.

After the Stonewall riots, gays and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gays and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first <a href="Pride%20parade">gay pride marches</a> took place in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago commemorating the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches were organized in other cities. Today, Gay Pride events are held annually throughout the world toward the end of June to mark the Stonewall riots. The <a href="Stonewall%20National%20Monument">Stonewall National Monument</a> was established at the site in 2016. 

As of 2017, plans were advancing by the <a href="State%20of%20New%20York">State of New York</a> to host the largest international LGBT pride celebration in 2019, known as Stonewall 50 / WorldPride, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. In New York City, the Stonewall 50 / WorldPride events produced by <a href="Heritage%20of%20Pride">Heritage of Pride</a> will be enhanced through a partnership made with the <a href="I%20Love%20New%20York">I LOVE NY</a> program's LGBT division and shall include a welcome center during the weeks surrounding the Stonewall 50 / WorldPride events that is open to all. Additional commemorative arts, cultural, and educational programing to mark the 50th anniversary of the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn will be taking place throughout the city and <a href="LGBT%20rights%20by%20country%20or%20territory">the world</a>; it is believed that 2019 will be the largest international <a href="New%20York%20City%20Pride%20March">LGBT pride celebration</a> held in history.

Following the social upheaval of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to "restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change", according to historian Barry Adam. Spurred by the national emphasis on <a href="anti-communism">anti-communism</a>, Senator <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> conducted hearings searching for communists in the U.S. government, the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a>, and other government-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia. <a href="Anarchism">Anarchists</a>, <a href="Communism">communists</a>, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Homosexuals were included in this list by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. State Department</a> on the theory that they were susceptible to <a href="blackmail">blackmail</a>. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by <a href="Clyde%20R.%20Hoey">Clyde R. Hoey</a> noted in a report, "It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons", and said all of the government's intelligence agencies "are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks". Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Post Office</a> kept track of addresses where material pertaining to <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> was mailed. State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to homosexuals were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed "sweeps" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual. Thousands of gay men and women were publicly humiliated, physically harassed, fired, jailed, or institutionalized in mental hospitals. Many lived double lives, keeping their private lives secret from their professional ones.

In 1952, the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> listed homosexuality in the "<a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a>" ("DSM") as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist <a href="Evelyn%20Hooker">Evelyn Hooker</a> performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the "DSM" until 1973.

In response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of homosexuals and provide social opportunities where gays and lesbians could socialize without fear of being arrested. <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> area homosexuals created the <a href="Mattachine%20Society">Mattachine Society</a> in 1950, in the home of communist activist <a href="Harry%20Hay">Harry Hay</a>. Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist "sexual deviants" with legal troubles. Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gays and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals. Soon after, several women in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> met in their living rooms to form the <a href="Daughters%20of%20Bilitis">Daughters of Bilitis</a> (DOB) for lesbians. Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.

One of the first challenges to government repression came in 1953. An organization named <a href="ONE%2C%20Inc.">ONE, Inc.</a> published a magazine called "ONE". The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually <a href="One%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Olesen">went to the Supreme Court</a>, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.

<a href="Homophile">Homophile</a> organizations—as homosexual groups self-identified in this era—grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. <a href="Frank%20Kameny">Frank Kameny</a> founded the Mattachine of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at <a href="mental%20health%20professional">mental health professional</a>s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.

In 1965, news on <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. Similar demonstrations were then held also at other government buildings. The purpose was to protest the treatment of gays in Cuba and U.S. employment discrimination. These pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the civil rights movement and <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20U.S.%20involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War">opposition to the Vietnam War</a> all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.

On the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small <a href="Cooper%20Do-nuts%20Riot">riot at the Cooper Do-nuts</a> cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.

In a larger event in 1966 in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and transvestites were sitting in <a href="Compton%27s%20Cafeteria%20riot">Compton's Cafeteria</a> when the police arrived to arrest men dressed as women. A riot ensued, with the patrons of the cafeteria slinging cups, plates, and saucers, and breaking the <a href="Poly%28methyl%20methacrylate%29">plexiglass</a> windows in the front of the restaurant, and returning several days later to smash the windows again after they were replaced. Professor <a href="Susan%20Stryker">Susan Stryker</a> classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It marked the beginning of <a href="transgender">transgender</a> activism in San Francisco.

The <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> were home to a sizable homosexual population after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when men and women who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities. The enclaves of gays and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as "short-haired women and long-haired men", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades. <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, <a href="Speakeasy">speakeasies</a> and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all.

The social repression of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the <a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat</a> poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.

By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor <a href="Robert%20F.%20Wagner%2C%20Jr.">Robert F. Wagner, Jr.</a>, who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 World's Fair</a>. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. <a href="Entrapment">Entrapment</a> usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for <a href="solicitation">solicitation</a>. One story in the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.

The Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected Mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the <a href="Alcohol%20laws%20of%20New%20York">New York State Liquor Authority</a> (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become "disorderly". Despite the high population of gays and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a "sip-in" at a Greenwich Village bar named <a href="Julius%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Julius</a>, which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.

None of the bars frequented by gays and lesbians were owned by gay people. Almost all of them were owned and controlled by <a href="American%20Mafia">organized crime</a>, who treated the regulars poorly, watered down the liquor, and overcharged for drinks. However, they also paid off police to prevent frequent raids.

The Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 <a href="Christopher%20Street">Christopher Street</a>, along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the <a href="Genovese%20crime%20family">Genovese crime family</a>. In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff, as the Stonewall Inn had no <a href="liquor%20license">liquor license</a>. It had no running water behind the bar—used glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused. There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently. Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other "cash transactions" took place. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed; dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club.

Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 were greeted by a <a href="Bouncer%20%28doorman%29">bouncer</a> who inspected them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called "Lily Law", "Alice Blue Gown", or "Betty Badge"), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or <a href="black%20light">black light</a>s. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go. Only a few <a href="Transvestism">transvestite</a>s, or men in full <a href="Drag%20%28clothing%29">drag</a>, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were "98 percent male" but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby <a href="Christopher%20Park">Christopher Park</a>, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as ""the" gay bar in the city".

Police raids on gay bars were frequent—occurring on average once a month for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their <a href="Conscription">draft card</a>s as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.

At 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, and Detective Charles Smythe and Deputy Inspector <a href="Seymour%20Pine">Seymour Pine</a> arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced "Police! We're taking the place!" Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p. 194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Days after the raid, one of the bar owners complained that the tipoff had never come, and that the raid was ordered by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20and%20Firearms">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</a>, who objected that there were no <a href="Revenue%20stamp">stamps</a> on the liquor bottles, indicating the alcohol was <a href="Rum-running">bootlegged</a>.

Historian David Carter presents information indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the <a href="Financial%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Financial District</a>. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205 people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,

Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.

The raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. Maria Ritter, then known as male to her family, recalled, "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!" Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by "feeling some of them up inappropriately" while frisking them.

The police were to transport the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15 minutes. Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150 people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic."

When the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd—most of whom were homosexual—had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, "Gay power!", someone began singing "<a href="We%20Shall%20Overcome">We Shall Overcome</a>", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with "growing and intensive hostility". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author <a href="Edmund%20White">Edmund White</a>, who had been passing by, recalled, "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing." Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.

A scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as "a typical New York butch" and "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a <a href="baton%20%28law%20enforcement%29">baton</a> for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (<a href="Storm%C3%A9%20DeLarverie">Stormé DeLarverie</a> has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, "Why don't you guys do something?" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon, the crowd became a mob and went "berserk": "It was at that moment that the scene became explosive."

The police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled "Let's pay them off!" Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted "Pigs!" and "Faggot cops!" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600 people, grabbed several people, including folk singer <a href="Dave%20Van%20Ronk">Dave Van Ronk</a>—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.

Multiple accounts of the riot assert that there was no pre-existing organization or apparent cause for the demonstration; what ensued was spontaneous. Michael Fader explained,

We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.

The only photograph taken during the first night of the riots shows the homeless youth who slept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police. The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: "It catered largely to a group of people who are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering... The Stonewall became home to these kids. When it was raided, they fought for it. That, and the fact that they had nothing to lose other than the most tolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why."

Garbage cans, garbage, bottles, rocks, and bricks were hurled at the building, breaking the windows. Witnesses attest that "flame queens", hustlers, and gay "street kids"—the most outcast people in the gay community—were responsible for the first volley of projectiles, as well as the uprooting of a <a href="parking%20meter">parking meter</a> used as a <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a> on the doors of the Stonewall Inn. <a href="Sylvia%20Rivera">Sylvia Rivera</a>, a self-identified <a href="drag%20queen">street queen</a> who had been in the Stonewall during the raid, remembered:

You've been treating us like shit all these years? Uh-uh. Now it's our turn!... It was one of the greatest moments in my life.

The mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was ineffective in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by <a href="plywood">plywood</a> by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. "The Village Voice" writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt <a href="Charcoal%20lighter%20fluid">lighter fluid</a> into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45 minutes.

The <a href="Riot%20control">Tactical Patrol Force</a> (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously."

The TPF formed a <a href="phalanx%20formation">phalanx</a> and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu <a href="kick%20line">kick line</a>s, and sang to the tune of <a href="Ta-ra-ra%20Boom-de-ay">Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay</a>: "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." <a href="Lucian%20Truscott%20IV">Lucian Truscott</a> reported in "The Village Voice": "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery in the form of a chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay power[-]ites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a <a href="Baton%20%28law%20enforcement%29">nightstick</a>." Another account stated, "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [nightsticks] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line."

<a href="Craig%20Rodwell">Craig Rodwell</a>, owner of the <a href="Oscar%20Wilde%20Bookshop">Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop</a>, reported watching police chase participants through the crooked streets, only to see them appear around the next corner behind the police. Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. <a href="Jack%20Nichols%20%28activist%29">Jack Nichols</a> and <a href="Lige%20Clarke">Lige Clarke</a>, in their column printed in "<a href="Screw%20%28magazine%29">Screw</a>", declared that "massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!' "

By 4:00 a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be "electricity in the air". One commented: "There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street." Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, <a href="jukebox">jukebox</a>es, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.

During the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", and the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" to inform them what was happening. All three papers covered the riots; the "Daily News" placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society">Students for a Democratic Society</a>, the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panthers</a>, or triggered by "a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes". All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. <a href="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring "Drag power", "They invaded our rights", "Support gay power", and "Legalize gay bars", along with accusations of police looting, and—regarding the status of the bar—"We are open."

The next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent. Many of the same people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and "queens"—but they were joined by "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets."

Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, <a href="Marsha%20P.%20Johnson">Marsha P. Johnson</a>, an <a href="African-American">African-American</a> <a href="drag%20queen">street queen</a>, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth <a href="Organization%20of%20the%20New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department%23Police%20precincts">Precinct</a>s, but after 2:00 a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as "sissies" or "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them. Street battling ensued again until 4:00 a.m.

<a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat</a> poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> lived on Christopher Street, and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, "Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, "You know, the guys there were so beautiful—they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago."

Activity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: "Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars." The leaflets called for gays to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the "intolerable situation".

Not everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the <a href="Mattachine%20Society">Mattachine Society</a> who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. <a href="Randy%20Wicker">Randy Wicker</a>, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap." Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a "sleaze joint", as advantageous to the Village.

On Wednesday, however, "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: "forces of faggotry", "limp wrists", and "Sunday fag follies". A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of "The Village Voice". Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people. The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: "The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression."

The feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, called the <a href="Annual%20Reminder">Annual Reminder</a>. Organizers <a href="Craig%20Rodwell">Craig Rodwell</a>, <a href="Frank%20Kameny">Frank Kameny</a>, <a href="Randy%20Wicker">Randy Wicker</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Gittings">Barbara Gittings</a>, and <a href="Kay%20Lahusen">Kay Lahusen</a>, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, "None of that! None of that!" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, "It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered." Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.

Although the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, "The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World." When a Mattachine officer suggested an "amicable and sweet" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, "Sweet! "Bullshit!" That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play." With a flyer announcing: "Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!", the <a href="Gay%20Liberation%20Front">Gay Liberation Front</a> (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use "gay" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the <a href="Daughters%20of%20Bilitis">Daughters of Bilitis</a>, and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.

The rise of militancy became apparent to <a href="Frank%20Kameny">Frank Kameny</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Gittings">Barbara Gittings</a>—who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles—when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, "I'm gay. That's why I'm here." The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">antiwar</a> demonstrators with the ideal that they "could work to restructure American society". They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the <a href="New%20York%20Women%27s%20House%20of%20Detention">Women's House of Detention</a> in support of <a href="Afeni%20Shakur">Afeni Shakur</a>, and other radical <a href="New%20Left">New Left</a> causes. Four months after they formed, however, the group disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.

Within six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called "Gay"; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city—"The Village Voice"—refused to print the word "gay" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers. Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: "Come Out!" and "Gay Power"; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.

GLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>. In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the <a href="Gay%20Activists%20Alliance">Gay Activists Alliance</a> (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, "We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings." The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a <a href="Zap%20%28action%29">zap</a>, where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> was zapped several times—once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.

Raids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167 people were arrested. One of them was <a href="Diego%20Vi%C3%B1ales">Diego Viñales</a>, an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be <a href="Deportation">deported</a> as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a spike fence. "The New York Daily News" printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gays, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF. They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and Congressman <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.

The Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.

Christopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, these were the first <a href="Pride%20parade">Gay Pride marches</a> in U.S. history. The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>, and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The <a href="LGBT%20Pride%20March%20%28New%20York%20City%29">march in New York</a> covered 51 blocks, from <a href="Christopher%20Street">Christopher Street</a> to <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers. "The New York Times" reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks. Reporting by "The Village Voice" was positive, describing "the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago".

By 1972, the participating cities included <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>, <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, as well as <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>.

Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred."

Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as "one of the greatest mistakes of his life". The image of gays retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals". Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale." David Carter, in his article "What made Stonewall different", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.

Within two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their <a href="Homosexuality">same-sex attraction</a>. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after <a href="Barbara%20Gittings">Barbara Gittings</a> exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist <a href="Jean%20O%27Leary">Jean O'Leary</a> protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by <a href="cross-dressers">cross-dressers</a> and <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, <a href="Sylvia%20Rivera">Sylvia Rivera</a> and <a href="Lee%20Brewster">Lee Brewster</a> jumped on the stage and shouted "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and "these bitches" tell us to quit being ourselves!" Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.

O'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too difficult to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to <a href="Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York">upstate New York</a>, but later returned to the city in the mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?"

O'Leary was referring to the <a href="Lavender%20Menace">Lavender Menace</a>, a description by <a href="Second-wave%20feminism">second wave feminist</a> <a href="Betty%20Friedan">Betty Friedan</a> for attempts by members of the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women</a> (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, <a href="Rita%20Mae%20Brown">Rita Mae Brown</a> and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.

The growth of <a href="lesbian%20feminism">lesbian feminism</a> in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—<a href="entrapment">entrapment</a> and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what <a href="Adrienne%20Rich">Adrienne Rich</a> termed "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars". Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining "It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena."

Throughout the 1970s gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the "zap" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> (APA). At a conference on <a href="behavior%20modification">behavior modification</a>, during a film demonstrating the use of <a href="Electroconvulsive%20therapy">electroshock therapy</a> to decrease same-sex attraction, <a href="Morris%20Kight">Morris Kight</a> and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of "Torture!" and "Barbarism!" They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexuals were not mentally ill. When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought <a href="John%20E.%20Fryer">John E. Fryer</a>, a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973—in large part due to the efforts of gay activists—the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the "<a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a>".

Gay men and lesbians came together to work in <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named <a href="Save%20Our%20Children">Save Our Children</a> staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in <a href="Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County, Florida</a>. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the <a href="Briggs%20Initiative">Briggs Initiative</a>, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.

The Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior <a href="LGBT%20culture">gay and lesbian culture</a>, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian <a href="Martin%20Duberman">Martin Duberman</a> writes, "The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gays and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland." Sociologist <a href="Barry%20D.%20Adam">Barry Adam</a> notes, "Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?" In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of <a href="butch%20and%20femme">butch and femme</a> that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: "all role playing is sick." Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior. Some women, according to <a href="Lillian%20Faderman">Lillian Faderman</a>, were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.

Author Michael Bronski highlights the "attack on pre-Stonewall culture", particularly <a href="Gay%20male%20pulp%20fiction">gay pulp fiction</a> for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as "an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men", have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, "gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past."

The riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gays and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of "exploitation and degradation". The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the "ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality". Historian Nicholas Edsall writes, 

Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.

Before the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and <a href="Adam%20Nagourney">Adam Nagourney</a> write, 

a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.

Historian <a href="Lillian%20Faderman">Lillian Faderman</a> calls the riots the "shot heard round the world", explaining, "The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they."
<a href="Joan%20Nestle">Joan Nestle</a> co-founded the <a href="Lesbian%20Herstory%20Archives">Lesbian Herstory Archives</a> in 1974, and credits "its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets." Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,

I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.

The events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' <a href="Black%20Cat%20Tavern">Black Cat Tavern</a> in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was across the street from "The Village Voice" offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks and months after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual <a href="Gay%20Pride">Gay Pride</a> events around the world.

<a href="Stonewall%20%28charity%29">Stonewall</a> (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> <a href="gay%20rights">rights</a> charity in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, founded in 1989, and named after the <a href="Stonewall%20Inn">Stonewall Inn</a> because of the Stonewall riots. The <a href="Stonewall%20Awards">Stonewall Awards</a> is an annual event by <a href="Stonewall%20%28charity%29">Stonewall</a> held since 2006 to recognize people who have affected the lives of <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.

The middle of the 1990s was marked by the inclusion of <a href="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>s as a represented group within the gay community, when they successfully sought to be included on the platform of the 1993 <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Lesbian%2C%20Gay%20and%20Bi%20Equal%20Rights%20and%20Liberation">March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation</a>. Transgender people also asked to be included, but were not, though trans-inclusive language was added to the march's list of demands. The transgender community continued to find itself simultaneously welcome and at odds with the gay community as attitudes about binary and fluid sexual orientation and gender developed and came increasingly into conflict. In 1994, New York City celebrated "Stonewall 25" with a march that went past the <a href="United%20Nations%20Headquarters">United Nations Headquarters</a> and into <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. Estimates put the attendance at 1.1 million people. <a href="Sylvia%20Rivera">Sylvia Rivera</a> led an alternate march in New York City in 1994 to protest the exclusion of transgender people from the events. Attendance at LGBT Pride events has grown substantially over the decades. Most large cities around the world now have some kind of Pride demonstration. Pride events in some cities mark the largest annual celebration of any kind. The growing trend towards commercializing marches into parades—with events receiving corporate sponsorship—has caused concern about taking away the autonomy of the original grassroots demonstrations that put inexpensive activism in the hands of individuals.

A "Stonewall Shabbat <a href="Seder">Seder</a>" was first held at <a href="B%27nai%20Jeshurun%20%28Manhattan%29">B'nai Jeshurun</a>, a synagogue on New York's Upper West Side, in 1995.

In June 1999, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. Department of the Interior</a> designated 51 and 53 Christopher Street and the surrounding streets as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, the first of significance to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In a dedication ceremony, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior <a href="John%20Berry%20%28administrator%29">John Berry</a> stated, "Let it forever be remembered that here—on this spot—men and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we may be who we are, we may work where we will, live where we choose and love whom our hearts desire." The Stonewall Inn itself was named a National Historic Landmark in 2000, and it is located in the <a href="Greenwich%20Village%20Historic%20District">Greenwich Village Historic District</a>, a preserved area.

On June 1, 2009, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> declared June 2009 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, citing the riots as a reason to "commit to achieving equal justice under law for LGBT Americans". The year marked the 40th anniversary of the riots, giving journalists and activists cause to reflect on progress made since 1969. <a href="Frank%20Rich">Frank Rich</a> in "The New York Times" noted that no federal legislation exists to protect the rights of gay Americans. An editorial in the "<a href="Washington%20Blade">Washington Blade</a>" compared the scruffy, violent activism during and following the Stonewall riots to the lackluster response to failed promises given by President Obama; for being ignored, wealthy LGBT activists reacted by promising to give less money to Democratic causes. Two years later, the Stonewall Inn served as a rallying point for celebrations after the New York Senate voted to pass <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20New%20York">same-sex marriage</a>. The act was signed into law by Governor <a href="Andrew%20Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> on June 24, 2011. Individual states continue to battle with homophobia. The <a href="Missouri%20Senate">Missouri Senate</a> passed a measure its supporters characterize as a religious freedom bill that could change the state's constitution despite Democrats' objections, and their 39-hour <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>. This bill allows the "protection of certain religious organizations and individuals from being penalized by the state because of their sincere religious beliefs or practices concerning marriage between two persons of the same sex" discriminating against homosexual patronage.

Obama also referenced the Stonewall riots in a call for full equality during his <a href="Second%20inauguration%20of%20Barack%20Obama">second</a> <a href="inaugural%20address">inaugural address</a> on January 21, 2013:

We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal—is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall... Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.

This was a historic moment, being the first time that a president mentioned <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a> or the word "gay" in an inaugural address.

In 2014, a marker dedicated to the Stonewall riots was included in the <a href="Legacy%20Walk">Legacy Walk</a>, an outdoor public display in Chicago celebrating <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> history and people.

On May 29, 2015, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Landmarks%20Preservation%20Commission">New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> announced it would officially consider designating the Stonewall Inn as a landmark, making it the first city location to be considered based on its LGBT cultural significance alone. On June 23, 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously approved the designation of the Stonewall Inn as a city landmark, making it the first landmark honored for its role in the fight for gay rights.

The <a href="Stonewall%20Book%20Award">Stonewall Book Award</a> is a set of three literary awards that annually recognize "exceptional merit relating to the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender experience" in English-language books published in the U.S.

Stephen I of Hungary

Stephen I, also known as King Saint Stephen (; ; ; 975 – 15 August 1038 AD), was the last <a href="Grand%20Prince%20of%20the%20Hungarians">Grand Prince of the Hungarians</a> between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a> from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a>. At his birth, he was given the pagan name Vajk. The date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince <a href="G%C3%A9za%2C%20Grand%20Prince%20of%20the%20Hungarians">Géza</a> and his wife, <a href="Sarolt">Sarolt</a>, who was descended from the prominent family of the "<a href="Gyula%20%28title%29">gyulas</a>". Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of <a href="%C3%81rp%C3%A1ds">his family</a> to become a devout Christian. He married <a href="Gisela%20of%20Hungary">Gisela of Bavaria</a>, a scion of the imperial <a href="Ottonian%20dynasty">Ottonian dynasty</a>.

After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, <a href="Kopp%C3%A1ny">Koppány</a>, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights, including <a href="Vecelin">Vecelin</a>, <a href="Hont-P%C3%A1zm%C3%A1ny%23Notable%20members%20of%20the%20clan">Hont and Pázmány</a>, but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a>. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the <a href="Black%20Hungarians">Black Hungarians</a> and his uncle, <a href="Gyula%20III">Gyula the Younger</a>he unified the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a>. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of <a href="Conrad%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.

Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">counties</a> organized around fortresses and administered by <a href="Isp%C3%A1n">royal officials</a>. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for <a href="pilgrims">pilgrims</a> and merchants traveling between <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a> and the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> or <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

He survived all of his children. He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in <a href="Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r%20Basilica">his new basilica</a>, built in <a href="Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r">Székesfehérvár</a> and dedicated to the <a href="Holy%20Virgin">Holy Virgin</a>. His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades. He was <a href="canonized">canonized</a> by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope Gregory VII</a>, together with his son, <a href="Saint%20Emeric%20of%20Hungary">Emeric</a>, and Bishop <a href="Gerard%20of%20Csan%C3%A1d">Gerard of Csanád</a>, in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> (celebrated on 20 August) is also a <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Hungary">public holiday</a> commemorating the foundation of the state.

Stephen's birth date is uncertain as it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents. Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975. The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century <a href="hagiographies">hagiographies</a> and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was "still an adolescent" in 997, substantiate the reliability of the later year (975). Stephen's "<a href="Life%20of%20Saint%20Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary%20%28Vita%20minor%29">Lesser Legend</a>" adds that he was born in <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a>, which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, <a href="G%C3%A9za%2C%20Grand%20Prince%20of%20the%20Hungarians">Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians</a>, chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year. Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods. Both his son's "<a href="Life%20of%20Saint%20Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary%20%28Vita%20maior%29">Greater Legend</a>" and the nearly contemporaneous <a href="Thietmar%20of%20Merseburg">Thietmar of Merseburg</a> described Géza as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords.

Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen's mother was <a href="Sarolt">Sarolt</a>, daughter of <a href="Gyula%20II">Gyula</a>, a <a href="gyula%20%28title%29">Hungarian chieftain</a> with jurisdiction either in <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> and <a href="Mure%C8%99%20%28river%29">Maros</a>. Many historiansincluding Pál Engel and <a href="Gyula%20Krist%C3%B3">Gyula Kristó</a>propose that her father was identical with "Gylas", who had been baptized in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> around 952 and "remained faithful to Christianity", according to Byzantine chronicler <a href="John%20Skylitzes">John Skylitzes</a>. However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Gy%C3%B6rffy">György Györffy</a> states that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital. In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the "<a href="Polish-Hungarian%20Chronicle">Polish-Hungarian Chronicle</a>" and later <a href="Poles">Polish</a> sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke <a href="Mieszko%20I%20of%20Poland">Mieszko I of Poland</a>, but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians.

Stephen was born as <a href="Vajk%20%28given%20name%29">Vajk</a>, a name derived from the <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a> word "baj", meaning "hero", "master", "prince" or "rich". Stephen's "Greater Legend" narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Prague">Adalbert of Prague</a>, who stayed in Géza's court several times between 983 and 994. However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous "Legend", written by <a href="Bruno%20of%20Querfurt">Bruno of Querfurt</a>, does not mention this event. Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Györffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth, while Kristó proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997.

Stephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop <a href="Hartvik">Hartvic</a> and sanctioned by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>, narrates that he "was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art" in his childhood. This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write. His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he "was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince". Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions. According to the "Illuminated Chronicle", one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28imperial%29">Italy</a>, who later founded a monastery in <a href="Tata%2C%20Hungary">Tata</a>.

According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen "ascended to the first stage of adolescence", at the age of 14 or 15. Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince. Györffy also writes, without identifying his source, that Géza appointed his son to rule the "<a href="Principality%20of%20Nitra">Nyitra ducate</a>" around that time. Slovak historians, including <a href="J%C3%A1n%20Steinh%C3%BCbel">Ján Steinhübel</a> and Ján Lukačka, accept Györffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now <a href="Nitra">Nitra</a>, Slovakia) from around 995.

Géza arranged Stephen's marriage, to <a href="Gisela%20of%20Hungary">Gisela</a>, daughter of <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Henry II, Duke of Bavaria</a>, in or after 995. This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house, as Gisela was closely related to the <a href="Ottonian%20dynasty">Ottonian dynasty</a> of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>s. According to popular tradition preserved in the <a href="Scheyern%20Abbey">Scheyern Abbey</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, the ceremony took place at the <a href="Scheyern">Scheyern</a> castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert. Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary, helping to strengthen Stephen's military position. Györffy writes that Stephen and his wife "presumably" settled in Nyitra after their marriage.

Grand Prince Géza died in 997. Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern regions of the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a>; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of <a href="seniority">seniority</a>, according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the <a href="%C3%81rp%C3%A1d%20dynasty">Árpád dynasty</a>, which was <a href="Kopp%C3%A1ny">Koppány</a> at that time. Koppány, who held the title Duke of <a href="Somogy%20County%20%28former%29">Somogy</a>, had for many years administered the regions of <a href="Transdanubia">Transdanubia</a> south of <a href="Lake%20Balaton">Lake Balaton</a>.

Koppány proposed to Géza's widow, Sarolt, in accordance with the pagan custom of <a href="levirate%20marriage">levirate marriage</a>. He also announced his claim to the throne. Although it is not impossible that Koppány had already been baptized, in 972, most of his supporters were pagans, opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue. A charter of 1002 for the <a href="Pannonhalma%20Archabbey">Pannonhalma Archabbey</a> writes of a war between "the Germans and the Hungarians" when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Koppány. Even so, Györffy says that "Oszlar" ("<a href="Alans">Alan</a>"), "Besenyő" ("<a href="Pechenegs">Pecheneg</a>"), "Kér" and other place names, referring to ethnic groups or <a href="Hungarian%20tribes">Hungarian tribes</a> in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Koppány's duchy, suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriorswho had been settled there by Grand Prince Gézafought in Stephen's army.

Kristó states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Koppány was only a feud between two members of the <a href="%C3%81rp%C3%A1d%20dynasty">Árpád dynasty</a>, with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders. Koppány and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen's forts and plundered his lands. Stephen, who according to the "Illuminated Chronicle" "was for the first time girded with his sword", placed the brothers <a href="Hont-P%C3%A1zm%C3%A1ny%23Notable%20members%20of%20the%20clan">Hont and Pázmány</a> at the head of his own guard and nominated <a href="Vecelin">Vecelin</a> to lead the royal army. The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of Géza. Hont and Pázmány were, according to <a href="Simon%20of%20K%C3%A9za">Simon of Kéza</a>'s "<a href="Gesta%20Hunnorum%20et%20Hungarorum">Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum</a>" and the "Illuminated Chronicle", "knights of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Swabia">Swabian</a> origin" who settled in Hungary either under Géza or in the first years of Stephen's reign. On the other hand, Lukačka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and Pázmány were "Slovak" noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra.

Koppány was besieging <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m">Veszprém</a> when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen's army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies. Koppány was killed on the battlefield. His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, <a href="Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a>, <a href="Gyulafeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r">Gyulafehérvár</a> (Alba Iulia, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>) and Veszprém in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch.

Stephen occupied Koppány's duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans. He also prescribed that Koppány's former subjects were to pay <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing <a href="Interpolation%20%28manuscripts%29">interpolations</a>. The same document declares that "there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary" at that time. On the other hand, the nearly contemporary Bishop <a href="Thietmar%20of%20Merseburg">Thietmar of Merseburg</a> stated that Stephen "established bishoprics in his kingdom" before being crowned king. If the latter report is valid, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Veszpr%C3%A9m">dioceses of Veszprém</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a> are the most probable candidates, according to historian <a href="G%C3%A1bor%20Thoroczkay">Gábor Thoroczkay</a>.

By ordering the display of one part of Koppány's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, the seat of his maternal uncle, <a href="Gyula%20III">Gyula the Younger</a>, Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.

Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown "with the favour and urging" of Emperor <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto III</a> (<a href="r.%23Historiography">r.</a> 996–1002), implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor's suzerainty before his coronation. On the other hand, all of Stephen's legends emphasize that he received his crown from <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a> (r. 999–1003). Kristó and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen "received the crown and consecration" from the Pope, but not without the Emperor's consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope Gregory VII</a> (r. 1075–1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had "offered and devotedly surrendered" Hungary "to <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>" (that is to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>). In a contrasting report, Stephen's "Greater Legend" states that the King offered Hungary to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. Modern historiansincluding Pál Engel, and Miklós Molnárwrite that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his "First Book of Laws" that he governed his realm "by the will of God".

The exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown. According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his "Greater Legend" suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or <a href="Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r">Székesfehérvár</a> followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was <a href="Anointment">anointed</a> with <a href="chrism">consecrated oil</a> during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a <a href="hoop%20crown">hoop crown</a> decorated with <a href="gemstones">gemstones</a>.

Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty. For instance, <a href="Coinage%20in%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">his first coins</a> bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS ("the king's spear") and depict an arm holding a spear with flag. According to the contemporaneous <a href="Ad%C3%A9mar%20de%20Chabannes">Adémar de Chabannes</a>, a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of Géza's right to "enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country". Stephen is styled in various ways"Ungarorum rex" ("king of the Hungarians"), "Pannoniorum rex" ("king of the Pannonians") or "Hungarie rex" ("king of Hungary")in his charters.

Although Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation, the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm "<a href="by%20the%20Grace%20of%20God">by the Grace of God</a>". All his legends testify that he established an <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Esztergom">archbishopric with its see in Esztergom</a> shortly after his coronation. This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named <a href="Domonkos%20I%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Esztergom">Domokos</a>, has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002. According to historian <a href="G%C3%A1bor%20Thoroczkay">Gábor Thoroczkay</a>, Stephen also established the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Kalocsa-Kecskem%C3%A9t">Diocese of Kalocsa</a> in 1001. Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom. Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including <a href="Radla">Radla</a> and <a href="Astrik">Astrik</a>, arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign. The presence of an unnamed "Archbishop of the Hungarians" at the <a href="synod">synod</a> of 1007 of <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and the consecration of an altar in <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a> in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen's <a href="prelate">prelate</a>s maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire.

The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his "First Book of Laws" from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a>s and the <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">confession</a> before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.

Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen's suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm "was most wide and rich", according to the "Illuminated Chronicle". Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary "Annals of Hildesheim" adds that Stephen converted his uncle's "country to the Christian faith by force" after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Alba%20Iulia">Diocese of Transylvania</a> to this period. If the identification, proposed by Kristó, Györffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokuiwho was Stephen's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburgis valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20I%20the%20Brave">Bolesław I the Brave</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Poland">Duke of Poland</a> (r. 992–1025).

About a hundred years later, the chronicler <a href="Gallus%20Anonymus">Gallus Anonymus</a> also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter "defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>". Györffy says that the chronicler's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river <a href="Morava%20%28river%29">Morava</a>a tributary of the Danubeby the <a href="Poles">Poles</a> in the 1010s. On the other hand, the "<a href="Polish-Hungarian%20Chronicle">Polish-Hungarian Chronicle</a>" states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century. According to Steinhübel, the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030. In contrast with the Slovak historian, Györffy writes that this late chronicle "in which one absurdity follows another" contradicts all facts known from 11th-century sources.

The "Illuminated Chronicle" narrates that Stephen "led his army against Kean, Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified" following the occupation of Gyula's country. According to a number of historians, including Zoltán Lenkey and Gábor Thoroczkay, Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003. Other historians, including Györffy, say that the chronicle's report preserved the memory of Stephen's campaign against <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgaria</a> in the late 1010s.

Likewise, the identification of the "<a href="Black%20Hungarians">Black Hungarians</a>"who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Adémar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen's proselytizing policyis uncertain. Györffy locates their lands to the east of the river <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a>; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia. Bruno of Querfurt's report of the Black Hungarians' conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when "the first mission of Saint Peter"a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, Cardinal Azoarrived in Hungary. The latter attended the meeting in <a href="Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a> where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20P%C3%A9cs">Bishopric of Pécs</a> was issued on 23 August 1009.

The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Eger">Diocese of Eger</a> was also set up around 1009. According to Thoroczkay, "it is very probable" that the bishopric's establishment was connected with the conversion of the <a href="Kabars">Kabars</a>an ethnic group of <a href="Khazars">Khazar</a> origin and their chieftain. The head of the Kabarswho was either <a href="Samuel%20Aba">Samuel Aba</a> or his father married Stephen's unnamed younger sister on this occasion. The <a href="Aba%20%28family%29">Aba clan</a> was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy. The reports by <a href="Anonymus%20%28chronicler%29">Anonymus</a>, Simon of Kéza and other Hungarian chroniclers of the Bár-Kalán, <a href="Cs%C3%A1k%20%28genus%29">Csák</a> and other 13th-century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process.

Stephen set up a territory-based administrative system, establishing <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">counties</a>. Each county, headed by a royal official known as a count or "<a href="isp%C3%A1n">ispán</a>", was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, <a href="Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r">Székesfehérvár</a> and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.

Stephen's brother-in-law, <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry II</a>, became <a href="King%20of%20Germany">King of Germany</a> in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013. Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th century. Even when Henry II's discontented brother, <a href="Bruno%20of%20Augsburg">Bruno</a>, sought refuge in Hungary in 1004, Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers-in-law. Around 1009, he gave his younger sister in marriage to <a href="Otto%20Orseolo">Otto Orseolo</a>, <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge of Venice</a> (r. 1008–1026), a close ally of the <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a>, <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> (r. 976–1025), which suggests that Hungary's relationship with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> was also peaceful. On the other hand, the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018. The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava. Györffy and Kristó write that a <a href="Pechenegs">Pecheneg</a> incursion into Transylvania, the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, also took place in this period, because the Pechenegs were close allies of the Polish duke's brother-in-law, Grand Prince <a href="Sviatopolk%20I%20of%20Kiev">Sviatopolk I of Kiev</a> (r. 1015–1019).

Poland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the <a href="Peace%20of%20Bautzen">Peace of Bautzen</a> in January 1018. Later in the same year, 500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20I%20the%20Brave">Boleslav of Poland</a> to <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty. The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen. According to Leodvin, the first known <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Oradea%20Mare">Bishop of Bihar</a> (r. 1050 – 1060), Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against "<a href="barbarian">barbarian</a>s" in the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a>. The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took "Cesaries" which Györffy identifies as the present-day town of <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>. Leodvin's report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with <a href="Byzantine%20conquest%20of%20Bulgaria">their conquest of Bulgaria</a> in 1018. However, the exact date of his expedition is uncertain. Györffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians.

Bishop Leodvin wrote that Stephen collected <a href="relic">relic</a>s of a number of saints in "Cesaries" during his campaign in the Balkans, including <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> and <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">Saint Nicholas</a>. He donated them to his new triple-naved basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Székesfehérvár, where he also set up a <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> and his new capital. His decision was influenced by the opening, in 1018 or 1019, of a new <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> route that bypassed his old capital, Esztergom. The new route connected Western Europe and the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> through Hungary. Stephen often met the pilgrims, contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe. Abbot <a href="Odilo%20of%20Cluny">Odilo of Cluny</a>, for example, wrote in a letter to Stephen that "those who have returned from the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">shrine of our Lord</a>" testify to the king's passion "towards the honour of our divine religion". Stephen also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> and <a href="Rome">Rome</a>.

In addition to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but were attacked by Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. Stephen's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX ("King Stephen") and REGIA CIVITAS ("royal city") were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>.

Stephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary. <a href="Gerard%20of%20Csan%C3%A1d">Gerard</a>, a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk who arrived in Hungary from the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> between 1020 and 1026, initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land, but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king. Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at <a href="P%C3%A9csv%C3%A1rad%20Abbey">Pécsvárad</a>, <a href="Zalav%C3%A1r">Zalavár</a> and <a href="Bakonyb%C3%A9l%20Abbey">Bakonybél</a>in this period.

The "<a href="Long%20Life%20of%20Saint%20Gerard">Long Life of Saint Gerard</a>" mentions Stephen's conflict with <a href="Ajtony">Ajtony</a>, a chieftain in the region of the river <a href="Mure%C8%99%20River">Maros</a>. Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s, although Györffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier. The conflict arose when Ajtony, who "had taken his power from the Greeks", according to Saint Gerard's legend, levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river. The king sent a large army led by <a href="Csan%C3%A1d">Csanád</a> against Ajtony, who was killed in battle. His lands were transformed into a Hungarian <a href="Csan%C3%A1d%20County">county</a> and the king set up a <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Szeged-Csan%C3%A1d">new bishopric at Csanád</a> (Cenad, Romania), Ajtony's former capital, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army. According to the "<a href="Annales%20Posonienses">Annales Posonienses</a>", the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030.

Stephen's brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024. He was succeeded by a distant relative, <a href="Conrad%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Conrad II</a> (r. 1024–1039), who adopted an offensive foreign policy. Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolothe husband of Stephen's sisterfrom Venice in 1026. He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, <a href="Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry</a>, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, Emeric had a strong claim to the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Duchy of Bavaria</a> through his mother. Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop <a href="Werner%20I%20%28Bishop%20of%20Strasbourg%29">Werner of Strasbourg</a>, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. Conrad II's biographer <a href="Wipo%20of%20Burgundy">Wipo of Burgundy</a> narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.

Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River <a href="R%C3%A1ba">Rába</a>. However, according to the "Annals of Niederalteich", the emperor, suffering from consequences of the <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> tactics used by the Hungarian army, returned to Germany "without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>". Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers <a href="Lajta">Lajta</a> and <a href="Fischa">Fischa</a> to Hungary in the summer of 1031.

Stephen's biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, "restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son", <a href="Saint%20Emeric%20of%20Hungary">Emeric</a>. However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031. After the death of his son, the elderly King could never "fully regain his former health", according to the "Illuminated Chronicle". Kristó writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the king keeping the <a href="vigil%20%28liturgy%29">vigils</a> and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son.

Emeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state, because Stephen's cousin, <a href="Vazul">Vazul</a>who had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the "<a href="Annales%20Altahenses">Annals of Altaich</a>" Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian <a href="Peter%20Orseolo">Peter Orseolo</a>, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, <a href="Levente">Levente</a>, <a href="Andrew%20I%20of%20Hungary">Andrew</a> and <a href="B%C3%A9la%20I%20of%20Hungary">Béla</a>, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court. According to Kristó, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the "Illuminated Chronicle".

In the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen's "Second Book of Laws" on the "conspiracy against the king and the kingdom" imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen. However, this view has not been universally accepted. Györffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009. Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Györffy, it was issued during Stephen's reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szakács argue that it "might be a later addition".

Stephen died on 15 August 1038. He was buried in the basilica of Székesfehérvár. His reign was followed by a long period of civil wars, pagan uprisings and foreign invasions. The instability ended in 1077 when <a href="Ladislaus%20I%20of%20Hungary">Ladislaus</a>, a grandson of Vazul, ascended the throne.

Stephen married <a href="Gisela%20of%20Hungary">Gisela</a>, a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria, who was a nephew of <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Gisela's mother was <a href="Gisela%20of%20Burgundy">Gisela of Burgundy</a>, a member of the <a href="Elder%20House%20of%20Welf">Welf dynasty</a>. Born around 985, Gisela was younger than her husband, whom she survived. She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in <a href="Passau">Passau</a> in Bavaria around 1060.

Although the "Illuminated Chronicle" states that Stephen "begot many sons", only two of them, Otto and Emeric, are known by name. Otto, who was named after Otto III, seems to have been born before 1002. He died as a child.

<a href="Saint%20Emeric%20of%20Hungary">Emeric</a>, who received the name of his maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His "Legend" from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his <a href="chastity">chastity</a> even during his marriage. According to Györffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's blinding and civil wars.

The following family tree presents Stephen's ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article.

"*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady."<br>"**Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian</a> <a href="Cometopuli%20dynasty">Cometopuli dynasty</a>."<br>"***Samuel Aba might have been the son of Stephen's sister instead of her husband."

Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary. His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the <a href="Huns">Huns</a>, <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a> and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory. As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom "forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule".

His successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements. Although Vazul's son, <a href="Andrew%20I%20of%20Hungary">Andrew I of Hungary</a>, secured the throne due to a <a href="Vata%20pagan%20uprising">pagan uprising</a>, he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should "live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them", according to the 14th-century "Illuminated Chronicle". In <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281000%E2%80%931526%29">medieval Hungary</a>, communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own "<a href="Privilege%20%28law%29">liberties</a>" often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen. An example is a 1347 letter from the people of <a href="T%C3%A1p">Táp</a> telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted "the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen".

Stephen's cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors. However, there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization. For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, <a href="Stephen%20II%20of%20Hungary">Stephen II</a>, was born in the early 12th century.

Stephen's canonization was initiated by Vazul's grandson, King <a href="Ladislaus%20I%20of%20Hungary">Ladislaus I of Hungary</a>, who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, <a href="Solomon%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary">Solomon</a>. According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was "decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see", suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII. The ceremony started at Stephen's tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying. Legend tells that Stephen's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at <a href="Visegr%C3%A1d">Visegrád</a>. The opening of Stephen's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen's legends. Historian Kristó attributes the healings either to <a href="Folie%20%C3%A0%20deux">mass psychosis</a> or deception. Stephen's legends also say that his "balsam-scented" remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with "rose-colored water", on 20 August. On the same day, Stephen's son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csanád, Gerard, were also canonized.

Stephen's first legend, the so-called "Greater Legend", was written between 1077 and 1083. It provided an idealized portrait of the king, one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary. However, Stephen's "Lesser Legend"composed around 1100, under King <a href="Coloman%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary">Coloman</a>emphasized Stephen's severity. A third legend, also composed during King Coloman's reign by Bishop Hartvic, was based on the two existing legends. Sanctioned in 1201 by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>, Hartvic's work served as Stephen's official legend. Gábor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen's legends "opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre", suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers. Stephen was the first triumphant "<a href="Miles%20Christianus">miles Christi</a>" ("Christ's soldier") among the canonized monarchs. He was also a "<a href="Confessor%20of%20the%20Faith">confessor king</a>", one who had not suffered martyrdom, whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs.

Stephen's cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary. Initially, he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a>, in Bavaria, but his relics were also taken to <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Montecassino">Montecassino</a> and <a href="Namur%2C%20Belgium">Namur</a>. Upon the liberation of <a href="Buda">Buda</a> from the Ottoman Turks, <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20XI">Pope Innocent XI</a> expanded King Saint Stephen's cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686, and declared 2 September his <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a>. As the feast of Saint <a href="Joachim">Joachim</a> was moved, in 1969, from 16 August, the day immediately following the day of Stephen's death, Stephen's feast was moved to that date. Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary, and regarded as the protector of kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons and bricklayers, and also of children suffering from severe illnesses. His canonization was recognized by <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Ecumenical Patriarch</a> <a href="Bartholomew%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Bartholomew I of Constantinople</a> in 2000. In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Stephen's feast is observed on 20 August, the day on which his relics were <a href="translation%20%28relics%29">translated</a>. In addition, a separate feast day (30 May) is dedicated to his "Holy Dexter".

Stephen's intact dexter, or right hand (), became the subject of a cult. A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1084 in <a href="Bihar%20County">Bihar County</a>. The theft of sacred relics, or "furta sacra", had by that time become a popular topic of saints' biographies. Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen's right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions. An abbey erected in Bihar County (now <a href="S%C3%A2niob">Sâniob</a>, Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter.

The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420. Following the <a href="Ottoman%20Hungary">Ottoman occupation</a> of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th century, it was guarded in many places, including <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a>, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a> donated it to the cloister of the <a href="Sisters%20of%20Loreto">Sisters of Loreto</a> in Buda. It was kept in <a href="Buda%20Castle">Buda Castle</a>'s St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Basilica">St. Stephen's Basilica</a> in Budapest. An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government. It was resumed in 1988.

According to Stephen's "Greater Legend", the king "himself compiled a book for his son on moral education". This work, now known as "Admonitions" or "De institutione morum", was preserved in manuscripts written in the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>. Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century.

The "Admonitions" argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the "pillars of his rule", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, "ispáns" and warriors.

King St Stephen has been a popular theme in <a href="Hungarian%20poetry">Hungarian poetry</a> since the end of the 13th century. The earliest poems were religious <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the <a href="Hungarian%20People%27s%20Republic">Communist regime</a> between 1949 and 1989.

A popular hymn, still sung in the churches, was first recorded in the late . It hails King St. Stephen as "radiant star of Hungarians". <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> composed his "<a href="King%20Stephen%20%28Beethoven%29">King Stephen Overture</a>" for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> in 1812. According to musician James M. Keller, "[t]he descending unisons that open the "King Stephen Overture" would seem to prefigure the opening of the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a>" [a]nd then a later theme, introduced by flutes and clarinets, seems almost to be a of the famous "Ode 'To Joy"' melody of the Ninth Symphony's finale". Hungarian composer <a href="Ferenc%20Erkel">Ferenc Erkel</a> named his last complete <a href="opera">opera</a> from 1885, "István király" ("King Stephen"), after him. In 1938, <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Kod%C3%A1ly">Zoltán Kodály</a> wrote a choral piece titled "Ének Szent István Királyhoz" ("Hymn to King Stephen"). In 1983, Levente Szörényi and <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20Br%C3%B3dy">János Bródy</a> composed a <a href="rock%20opera">rock opera</a>—"<a href="Istv%C3%A1n%2C%20a%20kir%C3%A1ly">István, a király</a>" ("Stephen, the King")—about the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Szörényi composed a sequel called "Veled, Uram!" ("You, Sir").
