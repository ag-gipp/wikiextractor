Halo: Contact Harvest

Halo: Contact Harvest is a <a href="military%20science%20fiction">military science fiction</a> <a href="novel">novel</a> by <a href="Joseph%20Staten">Joseph Staten</a>, based on the <a href="Halo%20%28series%29">"Halo" series</a> of <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s. The book was released in October 2007 and is the fifth "Halo" novel, following 2006's "", written by <a href="Eric%20Nylund">Eric Nylund</a>. Staten was a longtime employee of <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a>, the developer of the "Halo" video game series; he directed the <a href="cut%20scenes">cut scenes</a> in the video games and is a major contributor to "Halo"s storyline. He set out to write a novel that appealed to gamers, as well as those who had never read a "Halo" novel.

Set in 2525, twenty-seven years before the events of "", the novel tells the story of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Space%20Command">United Nations Space Command's</a> first encounter with the alien collective known as the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a> on the colony world of Harvest, and the beginning of the long war that follows. The novel is an ensemble piece, following human and alien characters. The protagonist is a young <a href="Marine%20Corps">Marine</a>, <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Avery%20Johnson">Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>, who also appears in the "Halo" video games. Upon release, the book was generally well received and became "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" bestseller in its first week. Critics pointed to the novel's success as a sign of the increasing importance of story in video games.

According to author <a href="Joseph%20Staten">Joseph Staten</a>, publisher <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor Books</a> asked "Halo"s developer, <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a>, if they had someone suited to writing the next novel. Staten, having written much of the "Halo" series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was the perfect way to elaborate on the "Halo" story without stripping it down for a video game: "I always felt we shortchanged [the player]. We don't have a lot of time to tell story while the bullets are flying." In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4TV</a>'s question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of "Halo". The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a "strong, consistent voice".

Originally, the novel was due to ship before the September 25 release of "Halo 3"; Staten stated that due to his involvement with both projects, the novel slipped behind. He also emphasized that he hoped "Contact Harvest" was a good novel, not just a good "Halo" novel; "... someone who isn't a "Halo" fan – someone who hasn't read any of the previous novels – will be able to pick up "Contact Harvest" and enjoy the read". 

This focus on accuracy was a challenge for Staten, as he believes his audience is highly intelligent, willing, and able to report flaws; fellow <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a> employees cross-referenced his drafts with the ""Halo" Story Bible" to ensure canonical agreement. One example of fans taking Staten to task over the novel occurred soon after the novel's cover was revealed in July 2007. The cover depicts the protagonist, Sergeant <a href="Avery%20J.%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a> holding a weapon known as the Battle Rifle. As the weapon was first introduced in the video game "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>" and the events of "Contact Harvest" take place decades before the game, fans were quick to say that Staten had made a mistake. Staten later pointed out he had good reasons for including the offending weapon in the book, and justified the inclusion by stating that the weapon is a prototypical form of the version players use in the game.

"Contact Harvest" takes place in the year 2524 of the Halo universe, where faster-than-light technology has allowed humanity to spread across the galaxy, founding new colonies administrated by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Space%20Command">United Nations Space Command</a>, or UNSC. The wealthier "Inner" colonies are politically dominant over the more recently established outer colonies, although the older planets rely on the new worlds for raw materials. Tensions lead to unrest and outright rebellion, with radical members of the outer colonies known as "Insurrectionists" launching terrorist attacks on the UNSC in a bid for independence.

"Contact Harvest" is an ensemble piece, with the action being narrated from both human and alien <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a> viewpoints. The novel features several characters seen previously in the video games as well as new characters. The protagonist is <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Avery%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a>, a <a href="Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> who is sent to the colony of Harvest to deal with suspected Insurrectionist activity; Johnson had previously appeared in the video game "" and its sequels, as well as the novel "". A side character is <a href="Private%20Jenkins">Wallace Jenkins</a>, a hapless Marine who is assimilated by the parasitic <a href="Flood%20%28Halo%29">Flood</a> in "Halo: Combat Evolved" and plays an important role in the <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of the game, "". "Contact Harvest" also illuminates the origins of several alien Covenant characters who play important roles in the video games, such as the Chieftain Tartarus and the three <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23High%20Prophets">Prophet Hierarchs</a>, Truth, Mercy, and Regret.

Humanity has spread across the galaxy, and the outer colony "Harvest" is one of the most remote. Although Harvest itself is only one-third the size of Earth, its fertile surface serves as the breadbasket for the other colonies. The United Nations Space Command <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Intelligence">Office of Naval Intelligence</a> (ONI) notices strange disappearances of human ships around Harvest, and assumes that Insurrectionists are attacking the vessels. ONI pulls Staff Sergeants <a href="Avery%20J.%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a> and Nolan Byrne from the frontlines of the civil war to raise a militia to protect Harvest. The disappearances are revealed to be alien <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Kig-Yar</a> vessels intercepting the ships in their search for relics left by the <a href="Forerunners%20%28Halo%29">Forerunners</a>, an ancient race sacred to the Kig-Yar and other members of the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>. Members of the vessel are shocked to discover that their instruments indicates hundreds of thousands of Forerunner relics on the planet of Harvest. A Covenant <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Unggoy</a> Deacon named Dadab is alarmed when he realizes the Kig-Yar shipmistress intends to steal a portion of the relics for herself, starting with relics leaving the planet on a human cargo ship. The ship is actually a trap set by the humans, with Johnson and Byrne on board. Johnson and Byrne kill several of the Covenant boarding party when they enter the cargo ship, which is later destroyed by a methane explosion. Dadab and his <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Huragok</a> friend, Lighter than Some, escape the blast and are picked up by a Covenant ship crewed by <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Jiralhanae</a>. These agents, led by their <a href="Tribal%20chief">chieftain</a> Maccabeus, have been ordered to confirm the presence of the relics; despite the reservations of his nephew, Tartarus, Maccabeus agrees to parley with the humans on Harvest. In the midst of the meeting in Harvest's gardens, the Covenant begin a firefight and the peace talks are shattered.

On the Covenant holy city of "High Charity", two <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">San 'Shyuum</a>, the Minister of Fortitude and the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, plot to take the place of the three Prophet Hierarchs currently leading the Covenant. They visit the old, supposedly senile Philologist for blessings and advice, seeking a third San 'Shyuum to help them usurp the throne. As Tranquility and Fortitude are meeting with the Philologist, the "Oracle", a <a href="Forerunners%20%28Halo%29">Forerunner</a> A.I. named <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%2305-032%20Mendicant%20Bias">Mendicant Bias</a>, suddenly awakens from eons of dormancy. Mendicant Bias informs the San 'Shyuum that the "Forerunner artifacts" found at Harvest are actually the A.I.'s "makers", living Forerunners—meaning that the humans themselves are the descendants of the Covenant's gods, and that all the Covenant's writings are false. The Minister of Fortitude realizes that the truth must never be revealed, as this revelation would tear the Covenant apart. Instead, Fortitude, Tranquility, and the Philologist plot to quickly take the throne so they can exterminate the "reclaimers".

Back on Harvest, Johnson and his squad of militia are heavily out-manned and out-gunned. Maccabeus is ordered to "<a href="Vitrification">glass</a>" the planet from space, but disobeys and launches a ground assault in an effort to recover the "relics". The human militia tries to keep the aliens busy while evacuating the civilians from the planet; this requires Johnson and his team to board an orbital platform controlled by Dadab and his troops. Tartarus challenges Maccabeus for control of the Jiralhanae pack, killing his uncle and becoming the next leader. Lighter than Some is killed by Tartarus' troops, and Dadab goes off to kill those he believes are responsible. As his weapon only has one more shot left, Dadab searches for Tartarus, who is fighting Johnson. Dadab destroys Tartarus' shield, and the enraged Brute kills the deacon. Wallace Jenkins, a young militia member that had lost his family in the battle, attempts to finish Tartarus off, but the alien escapes. The human civilians and survivors of Harvest successfully evacuate the planet on hundreds of freighters, while on "High Charity", the Minister of Fortitude, Tranquility, and The Philologist become the new Prophet Hierarchs. They take the names Truth, Regret, and Mercy, declaring a new age for the Covenant has begun, and that the humans must be annihilated for their crimes.

Upon release, "Contact Harvest" debuted at #3 on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Best Sellers list. The novel also appeared on the "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" and "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" bestseller's list at the same time. Reviewers noted that despite being an unproven writer, Staten had succeeded in crafting an excellent novel; complaints included the perceived overly descriptive prose and use of military <a href="jargon">jargon</a>. Will Tuttel of <a href="Gamespy.com">Gamespy.com</a> said said that the novel's success made sense because videogames are increasingly about the story. A ten-CD <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> was later released, featuring the voices of <a href="Holter%20Graham">Holter Graham</a> and <a href="Jen%20Taylor">Jen Taylor</a>; "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" enjoyed Graham's performance, but felt Taylor's over-emphasis and [sic]cheesy dialects detracted from the tension of the novel.

"Contact Harvest"s success was surprising to some. On January 8, 2008, <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s "All Things Considered" segment ran a story in which reporter Chana Joffe asked Staten if gamers read and acted surprised that "Halo" had a story at all. Several writers covering the story believed that the "All Things Considered" piece was biased against gamers and insulting. Scott Siegel of <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>, in particular, railed against interviewer Chana Joffe, saying that she "takes unfair jabs at video game fans".

USS Iowa turret explosion

On 19 April 1989, the Number Two <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">16-inch</a> <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> exploded. The explosion in the center gun room killed 47 of the turret's crewmen and severely damaged the gun turret itself. Two major investigations were undertaken into the cause of the explosion, one by the U.S. Navy and then one by the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) and <a href="Sandia%20National%20Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a>. The investigations produced conflicting conclusions.

The first investigation into the explosion, conducted by the U.S. Navy, concluded that one of the gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the explosion, had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a <a href="Homosexuality">homosexual</a> relationship and that Hartwig had caused the explosion after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused the explosion with either an electronic or chemical <a href="detonator">detonator</a>.

The victims' families, the media, and members of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> were sharply critical of the U.S. Navy's findings. The <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">U.S. Senate</a> and <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">U.S. House Armed Services Committees</a> both held hearings to inquire into the Navy's investigation and later released reports disputing the U.S. Navy's conclusions. The Senate committee asked the GAO to review the U.S. Navy's investigation. To assist the GAO, <a href="Sandia%20National%20Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> provided a team of scientists to review the Navy's technical investigation.

During its review, Sandia determined that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused an explosion in the <a href="gun%20breech">gun breech</a>. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.

In response to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion and concluded that the cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but did not offer apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.

Ordered in 1938 under the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201938">Second Vinson Act</a>, "Iowa" was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Iowa-class%20battleship">her class</a> of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 27 August 1942 and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 22 February 1943. "Iowa"’s main battery consisted of nine <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">16 inch (406.4mm)/50 caliber</a> guns.

After serving in both <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, "Iowa" was decommissioned on 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at <a href="Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>. She remained in the Reserve Fleet until 1983. At this time, "Iowa" was moved to <a href="Avondale%20Shipyards">Avondale Shipyards</a> near <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, to undergo a modernization as part of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s "<a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a>" plan. Under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> Gerald E. Gneckow, she was recommissioned on 28 April 1984, one year ahead of schedule. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to "Iowa"s engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory US Navy <a href="Board%20of%20Inspection%20and%20Survey">Board of Inspection and Survey</a> (InSurv) inspection was not conducted at that time.

Almost two years later, beginning on 17 March 1986, "Iowa" underwent her overdue InSurv inspection under the supervision of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="John%20D.%20Bulkeley">John D. Bulkeley</a>; the ship failed the inspection. Among many other deficiencies, the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of during a full-power engine run. Other problems discovered included <a href="hydraulic%20fluid">hydraulic fluid</a> leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling per turret per week, <a href="Cosmoline">Cosmoline</a> (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns, deteriorated <a href="bilge">bilge</a> piping, frequent shorts in the electrical wiring, pump failures, unrepaired soft patches on high-pressure steam lines, and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. Bulkeley personally recommended to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> (CNO), Admiral <a href="James%20D.%20Watkins">James Watkins</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a>, <a href="John%20Lehman">John Lehman</a>, that "Iowa" be taken out of service immediately. Lehman, who had advocated bringing the "Iowa"-class ships out of mothballs, did not take the ship out of service, but instructed the leaders of the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a> to ensure that "Iowa"s deficiencies were corrected.

A month after the InSurv, "Iowa" failed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation. A short time later, the ship retook and passed the evaluation. In July 1987, <a href="Larry%20Seaquist">Captain Larry Seaquist</a> assumed command of the ship.

After a deployment to the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, "Iowa" returned to Norfolk for maintenance on 10 March 1988. On 23 May, Captain Seaquist was replaced by <a href="Fred%20Moosally">Captain Fred Moosally</a> as "Iowa"'s commanding officer.

A week after taking command, Moosally and his executive officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1 million repair package for "Iowa"s main gun batteries, including repairs to the main gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all; instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, "Iowa" set sail on sea trials around the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> area and then began refresher training in the waters around <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> in October.

Between September 1988 and January 1989, sailors aboard "Iowa" reportedly conducted little training with her main guns, in part because of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">Ensign</a> Dan Meyer, the officer in charge of the ship's Turret One, <a href="morale">morale</a> and operational readiness among the gun-turret crews suffered greatly.

In January 1989 "Iowa"s <a href="Master%20Chief%20Petty%20Officer">Master Chief</a> <a href="Fire%20Controlman">Fire Controlman</a>, Stephen Skelley, and Gunnery Officer, <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> Kenneth Michael Costigan, persuaded Moosally to allow them to experiment with increasing the range of the main guns using "supercharged" powder bags and specially designed shells. Moosally was led to believe, falsely, that top officials from <a href="Naval%20Sea%20Systems%20Command">Naval Sea Systems Command</a> (NAVSEA) had authorized the experiments. In fact, John McEachren, a mid-level bureaucrat with NAVSEA, had given the go-ahead to conduct the experiments even though he had no authority to do so. McEachren concealed his approval of the gunnery experiments from his superiors.

Several of the <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and <a href="petty%20officer">petty officer</a>s in charge of the main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of the guns and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, "Iowa"s chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.

On 20 January 1989, off <a href="Vieques%20Island">Vieques Island</a>, "Iowa"s Turret One fired six of the experimental shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed that one of the 16 inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16 inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and <a href="Petty%20Officer%20First%20Class">Petty Officer First Class</a> Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.

A week after the long range shoot at Vieques, "Iowa"s new executive officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, over the objections of his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to <a href="smoldering">smolder</a> before the <a href="breechlock">breechlock</a> was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers at the base of the main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was "the most frightening experience I have ever had in my life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic."

In February the battleship returned to Norfolk. There Ziegler complained to his wife about the morale, training, and safety situation aboard "Iowa", stating, "We're shorthanded. Chiefs with seventeen years of service are quitting. I've got to teach these kids to push the right button, or they'll blow us to kingdom come! My butt is on the line!" He added that if he died at sea, he wanted to be buried at sea. Before leaving Norfolk in early April 1989, Third Class Gunner's Mate Scot Blakey, a member of Turret Two's crew, told his sister, Julie Blakey, "I'm not thrilled with some of the things we're doing on the "Iowa". We shouldn't be doing them. Something could go wrong." When Julie asked, "Why are you doing them?" Scot replied, "We don't have a choice."

On 10 April the battleship was visited by commander of the <a href="US%202nd%20Fleet">US 2nd Fleet</a>, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jerome%20L.%20Johnson">Jerome L. Johnson</a>, and on 13 April "Iowa" sailed from Norfolk to participate in a fleet <a href="military%20exercise">exercise</a> in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> near Puerto Rico. The exercise, titled "FLEETEX 3-89", began on or around 17 April under Johnson's command. "Iowa" served as Johnson's <a href="flagship">flagship</a> during the exercise.

Throughout the night of 18 April, Turret Two's crew conducted a major overhaul of their turret in preparation for a firing exercise scheduled to take place the next day. The center gun's <a href="compressed%20air">compressed air</a> system, which cleansed the bore of sparks and debris each time the gun was fired, was not operating properly.

Also on 18 April, "Iowa"s fire-control officer, <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Leo Walsh, conducted a briefing to discuss the next day's main battery exercise. Moosally, Morse, Kissinger, and Costigan did not attend the briefing. During the briefing, Skelley announced that Turret Two would participate in an experiment of his design in which D-846 powder would be used to fire 2700 lb (1224.7 kg) shells.

The powder lots of D-846 were among the oldest on board "Iowa", dating back to 1943–1945, and were designed to fire 1900 lb (861.8 kg) shells. In fact, printed on each D-846 powder canister were the words, "WARNING: Do Not Use with 2,700-pound projectiles." D-846 powder burned faster than normal powder, which meant that it exerted greater pressure on the shell when fired. Skelley explained that the experiment's purpose was to improve the accuracy of the guns. Skelley's plan was for Turret Two to fire ten 2,700-pound practice (no explosives) projectiles, two from the left gun and four rounds each from the center and right guns. Each shot was to use five bags of D-846, instead of the six bags normally used, and to fire at the empty ocean away.

Ziegler was especially concerned about his center gun crew. The rammerman, Robert W. Backherms, was inexperienced, as were the powder car operator, Gary J. Fisk, the primerman, Reginald L. Johnson Jr., and the gun captain, Richard Errick Lawrence. To help supervise Lawrence, Ziegler assigned <a href="Gunner%27s%20Mate">Gunner's Mate</a> Second Class Clayton Hartwig, the former center gun captain, who had been excused from gun turret duty because of a pending reassignment to a new duty station in <a href="London">London</a>, to the center gun's crew for the firing exercise. Because of the late hour, Ziegler did not inform Hartwig of his assignment until the morning of 19 April, shortly before the firing exercise was scheduled to begin.

The rammerman's position was of special concern, as ramming was considered the most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( per second), but there was no safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the <a href="Blasting%20cap">primer</a> might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of "Iowa"s rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car. "Iowa" crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun rammer would sometimes "take off" uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.

At <a href="24-hour%20clock">08:31</a> on 19 April, the main turret crewmembers were ordered to their stations in Turrets One, Two, and Three. Thirty minutes later the turrets reported that they were manned, swiveled to starboard in firing position, and ready to begin the drill. Vice Admiral Johnson and his staff entered the bridge to watch the firing exercise. "Iowa" was northeast of Puerto Rico, steaming at .

Turret One fired first, beginning at 09:33. Turret One's left gun misfired and its crew was unable to get the gun to discharge. Moosally ordered Turret Two to load and fire a three-gun salvo. According to standard procedure, the misfire in Turret One should have been resolved first before proceeding further with the exercise.

Forty-four seconds after Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch reported that Turret Two's right gun was loaded and ready to fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, "We have a problem here. We are not ready yet. We have a problem here." Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having a little trouble. We'll straighten that out." Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that the left and right guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, "Mort! Mort! Mort!" Ziegler shouted, "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth in the rear of the turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, "Oh, my God! There's a flash!"
At 09:53, about 81 seconds after Moosally's order to load and 20 seconds after the left gun had reported loaded and ready, Turret Two's center gun exploded. A fireball between and traveling at with a pressure of blew out from the center gun's open breech. The explosion caved in the door between the center gun room and the turret officer's booth and buckled the bulkheads separating the center gun room from the left and right gun rooms. The fireball spread through all three gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret. The resulting fire released toxic gases, including <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> gas from burning <a href="polyurethane">polyurethane</a> foam, which filled the turret. Shortly after the initial explosion, the heat and fire ignited of powder bags in the powder-handling area of the turret. Nine minutes later, another explosion, most likely caused by a buildup of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> gas, occurred. All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed. The turret contained most of the force of the explosion. Twelve crewmen working in or near the turret's powder magazine and annular spaces, located adjacent to the bottom of the turret, were able to escape without serious injury. These men were protected by blast doors which separate the magazine spaces from the rest of the turret.

Firefighting crews quickly responded and sprayed the roof of the turret and left and right gun barrels, which were still loaded, with water. Meyer and Kissinger, wearing <a href="gas%20mask">gas mask</a>s, descended below decks and inspected the powder flats in the turret, noting that the metal walls of the turret flats surrounding several tons of unexploded powder bags in the turret were now "glowing a bright cherry red". Meyer and Kissinger were accompanied by Gunner's Mate Third Class Noah Melendez in their inspection of the turret. On Kissinger's recommendation, Moosally ordered Turret Two's magazines, annular spaces, and powder flats flooded with seawater, preventing the remaining powder from exploding. The turret fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes. Brian Scanio was the first fireman to enter the burning turret, followed soon after by Robert O. Shepherd, Ronald G. Robb, and Thad W. Harms. The firemen deployed hoses inside the turret.

After the fire was extinguished, Mortensen entered the turret to help identify the bodies of the dead crewmen. Mortensen found Hartwig's body, which he identified by a distinctive <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a> on the upper left arm, at the bottom of the deep center gun pit instead of in the gun room. His body was missing his lower forearms, legs below the knees, and was partially, but not badly, charred. The gas ejection air valve for the center gun was located at the bottom of the pit, leading Mortensen to believe that Hartwig had been sent into the pit to turn it on before the explosion occurred. Mortensen also found that the center gun's powder hoist had not been lowered, which was unusual since the hoist door was closed and locked.
After most of the water was pumped out, the bodies in the turret were removed without noting or photographing their locations. The next day, the bodies were flown from the ship by helicopter to <a href="Roosevelt%20Roads%20Naval%20Station">Roosevelt Roads Naval Station</a>, Puerto Rico. From there, they were flown on a <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> <a href="C-5%20Galaxy">C-5 Galaxy</a> transport aircraft to the <a href="Charles%20C.%20Carson%20Center%20for%20Mortuary%20Affairs">Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs</a> at <a href="Dover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dover Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. Meyer made a rudimentary sketch of the locations of the bodies in the turret which would later contradict some of the findings in the U.S. Navy's initial investigation. With assistance from the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), the U.S. Navy was able to complete identification of all 47 sets of remains on 16 May 1989. Contradicting FBI records, the U.S. Navy would insist that all the remains had been identified by 24 April 1989, when all of the bodies were released to the families (Thompson, p. 171). The FBI cut the fingers off the unidentified corpses to identify them later. Body parts which had not been matched to torsos were discarded. Many of the remains were released to family members for burial before they were positively identified. Most of the bodies recovered from the center gun and turret officer's booth were badly burned and in pieces, making identification difficult. The bodies discovered lower in the turret were mostly intact; those crewmen had apparently died from suffocation, poisonous gases, or from impact trauma after being thrown around by the explosion. An <a href="explosive%20ordnance%20disposal">explosive ordnance disposal</a> technician, <a href="Operations%20Specialist%20%28United%20States%20Navy%29">Operations Specialist</a> First Class James Bennett Drake, from the nearby was sent to "Iowa" to assist in unloading the powder in Turret Two's left and right guns. After observing the scene in the center gun room and asking some questions, Drake told "Iowa" crewmen that, "It's my opinion that the explosion started in the center gun room caused by compressing the powder bags against the sixteen-inch shell too far and too fast with the rammer arm". Drake also helped Mortensen unload the powder from Turret One's left gun. When Turret One's left gun's breech was opened, it was discovered that the bottom powder bag was turned sideways. The projectile in Turret One's left gun was left in place and was eventually fired four months later.

Morse directed a cleanup crew, supervised by Lieutenant Commander Bob Holman, to make Turret Two "look as normal as possible". Over the next day, the crew swept, cleaned, and painted the inside of the turret. Loose or damaged equipment was tossed into the ocean. No attempt was made to record the locations or conditions of damaged equipment in the turret. "No one was preserving the evidence," said Brian R. Scanio, a fireman present at the scene. A team of Naval Investigative Service (NIS) investigators (the predecessor of the <a href="Naval%20Criminal%20Investigative%20Service">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> or NCIS) stationed nearby on the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> was told that their services in investigating "Iowa"s mishap were not needed. At the same time, Moosally called a meeting with all of his officers, except Meyer, who was working in Turret One, in the ship's <a href="wardroom">wardroom</a>. At the meeting, "Iowa"s legal officer, Lieutenant Commander Richard Bagley, instructed the ship's officers on how to limit their testimony during the forthcoming investigation into the explosion. Terry McGinn, who was present at the meeting, stated later that Bagley "told everybody what to say. It was a party line pure and simple".
On 23 April "Iowa" returned to Norfolk, where a memorial service was held on 24 April. Several thousand people, including family members of many of the victims, attended the ceremony at which President George H. W. Bush spoke. During his speech, Bush stated, "I promise you today, we will find out 'why,' the circumstances of this tragedy." In a press conference after the ceremony, Moosally said that the two legalmen killed in the turret were assigned there as "observers". He also claimed that everyone in the turret was qualified for the position that they were filling.

Shortly after the memorial service at Norfolk on 24 April, Kendall Truitt told Hartwig's family that Hartwig had taken out a $50,000 <a href="double%20indemnity%20%28insurance%29">double indemnity</a> <a href="life%20insurance">life insurance</a> policy on himself and named Truitt as the sole beneficiary. Truitt was a friend of Hartwig's and had been working in Turret Two's powder magazine at the time of the explosion, but had escaped without serious injury. Truitt promised to give the life insurance money to Hartwig's parents. Unsure if she could trust Truitt, Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, mailed letters on 4 May to Moosally, Morse, Costigan, "Iowa"s <a href="Chaplain">Chaplain</a> Lieutenant Commander James Danner, and to Ohio Senators <a href="Howard%20Metzenbaum">Howard Metzenbaum</a> and <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a> in which she described the life insurance policy. She asked that someone talk to Truitt to convince him to give the money to Hartwig's parents.

Several hours after the explosion, Admiral <a href="Carlisle%20Trost">Carlisle Trost</a>, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), issued a moratorium on the firing of all 16-inch guns. Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell, commander of Surface Forces Atlantic, appointed Commodore Richard D. Milligan; a former commanding officer of USS New Jersey (BB-62), sister ship of Iowa, from 15 September 1983 to 7 September 1985; to conduct an informal one-officer investigation into the explosion. An informal investigation meant that testimony was not required to be taken under oath, witnesses were not advised of their rights, defense attorneys were not present, and no one, including the deceased, could be charged with a crime no matter what the evidence revealed.

Milligan boarded "Iowa" on 20 April and toured Turret Two. He did not attempt to stop the ongoing cleanup of the turret. Accompanying Milligan to assist him in the investigation was his personal staff, including his chief of staff, Captain Edward F. Messina. Milligan and his staff began their investigation by interviewing members of "Iowa"s crew.

During Meyer's interview by Milligan and his staff, Meyer described Skelley's gunnery experiments. Meyer stated that Moosally and Kissinger had allowed Skelley to conduct his experiments without interference or supervision. At this point, according to Meyer, Messina interrupted, told the <a href="stenographer">stenographer</a> to stop typing, and took Meyer out into the passageway and told him, "You little shit, you can't say that! The admiral doesn't want to hear another word about experiments!"

After reentering the interview room, Meyer told the panel that he and Mortensen had found Hartwig's body in the gun pit. After his interview was over, Meyer warned Mortensen, who was scheduled to be interviewed later, to be careful with what he said, because, in Meyer's opinion, Milligan and his staff appeared to have a hidden agenda. Later, when Meyer and Mortensen read transcripts of their interviews with Milligan's panel, they found that some of what they had said had been altered or expunged, including what Meyer had said about the location of Hartwig's body.
Scanio was interviewed by Milligan and his panel three days later. Scanio, in describing the interview, stated, "I told them everything that exactly happened...and it seemed that when I said certain things, they just stopped the recorder, and then they'd go on and ask a different question, and they wouldn't finish the question they were on." Scanio said that Milligan would not allow him to identify whose body was found at the bottom of the center gun pit.

During his interview, Skelley admitted that he was aware that it was illegal to use D-846 powder with 2,700-pound rounds. Skelley also admitted that he had no written permission from NAVSEA authorizing his experiments. In his interview with Milligan, Moosally complained that the U.S. Navy had given him a bunch of "misfits" for his crew.

Captain Joseph Dominick Miceli, from NAVSEA, was assigned to Milligan's team to lead the technical investigation into the explosion. Miceli had commanded the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Crane%20Division">Naval Weapons Support Center</a> at <a href="Crane%2C%20Indiana">Crane, Indiana</a> from 1982 to 1985. Much of the powder in use on "Iowa" was bagged under Miceli's direction at Crane. While at Crane, Miceli had also begun the use of "wear reducing" polyurethane foam jackets on the powder bags. Cyanide gas from the burning foam jackets had killed many of the turret crewmen. Therefore, as noted by Navy officers and later by outside observers, Miceli had a potential <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> regarding any findings that powder or powder bags had contributed to the explosion or to any deaths afterwards. <a href="John%20E.%20Gordon">Ted Gordon</a>, former Navy Deputy Judge Advocate General, stated: "Joe Miceli had his own turf to protect. The guns, the shells, the powder were all his responsibility. He had a vested interest in seeing that they were not at fault in the "Iowa" accident."

Upon receiving Kubicina's letters concerning Hartwig's life insurance policy, Morse and Moosally turned them over to Milligan on 7 May. Milligan immediately called Claude Rollins, the NIS regional director in Norfolk, and requested NIS assistance in the investigation. Ted Gordon, the commanding officer of the NIS, objected to opening a formal criminal investigation because Milligan's investigation was supposed to be informal. Admiral <a href="Leon%20A.%20Edney">Leon A. Edney</a>, the U.S. Navy's <a href="Vice%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Vice Chief of Naval Operations</a>, however, told Gordon that formal NIS participation in the investigation under Milligan's supervision was fine.

Meeting with NIS agents at Norfolk on 9 May, Messina explained that Hartwig had been Turret Two's center gun captain, had been peering into the gun's breech at the time of the explosion, according to the wounds found on his body, and had likely inserted an ignition device between two of the powder bags as the gun was loaded. Messina told the NIS agents about Hartwig's insurance policy and that a homosexual relationship had possibly existed between Hartwig and Truitt. Later, Milligan's team told the NIS that a book called "Getting Even: The Complete Book of Dirty Tricks" by <a href="George%20Hayduke%20%28author%29">George Hayduke</a> had been found in Hartwig's locker. Milligan subsequently reported that the book contained instructions on how to construct a bomb.

NIS agents Tom Goodman and Ed Goodwin interviewed Kubicina soon after accepting the case. After initially discussing the insurance policy, the agents began asking Kubicina about Hartwig's sexuality. Kubicina later found out that the U.S. Navy had also interviewed Hartwig's best friend from high school and lied to him about what she had said. NIS agents interviewed Truitt and repeatedly pressed him to admit to a sexual relationship with Hartwig. Other agents interviewed Truitt's wife Carole, also pressing her about the sexual orientation of Hartwig and Truitt, asking questions about how often she and her husband had sex, what sorts of sexual acts they engaged in, and whether she had ever had sex with any of Truitt's crewmates. When Truitt learned of the interview, he advised the NIS that he would not cooperate further with the investigation. A search of Truitt's locker turned up a burlap bag of the type filled with gunpowder for firing the big guns. Based on this, the insurance policy, Hartwig's known antipathy for Truitt's wife, and the belief that Truitt and Hartwig had been sexually involved, the NIS considered Truitt a suspect. Truitt and Hartwig had previously been questioned about being gay in February 1987, but each denied it and the matter had been dropped.
Beginning in May, reports on the NIS investigation began to appear in news media, including "<a href="The%20Virginian-Pilot">The Virginian-Pilot</a>", "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>", "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", and the "<a href="Daily%20Press%20%28Virginia%29">Daily Press</a>", most of which mentioned Hartwig or Truitt by name. The reporters later stated that the information in their stories was leaked to them by sources in the NIS, the U.S. Navy's <a href="Public%20affairs%20%28military%29">Chief of Naval Information</a> (CHINFO) office, led by Rear Admiral Brent Baker, or by other <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> (DoD) officials. On 24 May, the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a> (NBC) aired an <a href="NBC%20news">NBC news</a> story by Fred Francis and Len Tepper that identified Truitt and Hartwig as criminal suspects in the "Iowa" explosion and implied that the two had been in a homosexual relationship. NIS special agent James Whitener had—without authorization, it was later revealed by NIS officials—given Tepper and Francis <a href="Classified%20information">classified</a> computer diskettes containing the complete NIS files on the "Iowa" investigation. Later media reports indicated that the U.S. Navy believed that Hartwig had intentionally caused the explosion after his relationship with Truitt had gone sour.

On 25 May at Norfolk, NIS agents Goodman and Mike Dorsey interrogated Seaman David Smith, an "Iowa" crewman and friend of Hartwig. The NIS agents kept Smith in the interrogation room for 7 hours and 40 minutes and, according to Smith, repeatedly threatened that they would charge him with 47 counts of <a href="Accessory%20%28legal%20term%29">accessory to murder</a>, <a href="perjury">perjury</a>, and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> unless he admitted that Hartwig had told him that he intended to blow up Turret Two. Smith refused. At 10:00 p.m., Smith was allowed to return to "Iowa", where he then stood a nine-hour <a href="Watch%20system">watch</a>. Less than one hour after finishing the watch, Smith was taken back to the NIS building at Norfolk and interrogated for an additional six hours. Finally, Smith claimed that Hartwig had made romantic advances towards him, had shown him an explosive timer, and had threatened to blow up Turret Two. Three days later, however, Smith recanted his statement to the NIS in its entirety when he was asked to reread and reaffirm a transcript of the interrogation, and signed a statement to that effect. Smith's original statement was later leaked to the media without noting that he had retracted it.

Lieutenant Commander Thomas Mountz, a clinical psychologist assigned to assist the NIS investigation, asked the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>'s (FBI) <a href="Behavioral%20Analysis%20Unit">Behavioral Analysis Unit</a> for help in compiling a "psychological autopsy" on Hartwig. Visiting the FBI's facility at <a href="Quantico%2C%20Virginia">Quantico, Virginia</a>, Mountz, Goodman, Goodwin, and NIS employee Dawn Teague explained to FBI special agents Richard Ault and <a href="Roy%20Hazelwood">Roy Hazelwood</a> that the "Iowa" explosion was not an accident, but an act of sabotage. The NIS gave the FBI agents copies of their interviews with several "Iowa" crewmen, including Smith, and with Hartwig's family and acquaintances. They did not tell the FBI that Smith had recanted his statement to the NIS. On 15 June, the day after receiving the material about Smith's interview, Ault and Hazelwood issued a 15-page "equivocal death analysis" stating that, in their opinion, Hartwig was not homosexual but that he "died as a result of his own actions, staging his death in such a fashion that he hoped it would appear to be an accident".

NIS agents Robert Nigro and Goodman briefed Miceli on their case against Hartwig, telling him that they believed that Hartwig had blown up Turret Two with a <a href="Radio%20Shack">Radio Shack</a> timer, and gave him a copy of Smith's interview. They did not tell Miceli that Smith had recanted his statement or that the NIS had been unable to find any evidence that Hartwig had ever purchased any electronic device from Radio Shack. Miceli directed his team to begin testing to see if an electrical timer could have ignited the powder bags. Technicians at the Navy's metallurgical laboratory at Norfolk Naval Shipyard tested the copper-nickel-alloy rotating band from the center gun's projectile, and stated that they had found trace chemical elements, including barium, silicon, aluminum, and calcium, under the band, which indicated that an electronic timer had been used to cause the explosion. Miceli asked the FBI to duplicate the test on the band. After testing the band, the FBI stated that they did not believe an electronic timing device had been present and that chemicals found on the band likely came from Break-Free solvent used by the Navy to extract the projectile from the center gun barrel after the explosion. According to Ken Nimmich of the <a href="FBI%20Laboratory">FBI Laboratory</a>, Miceli then abruptly terminated the Navy's request for assistance from the FBI lab.

On 28 August, technicians at the Naval Weapons Support Center at Crane, Indiana confirmed the FBI's conclusion that an electronic timer, batteries, and/or a primer were not involved in the explosion. Subsequently, Miceli's team announced that a chemical—not electrical—ignition device had been used to cause the explosion, but the new conclusion was not included in Milligan's report before the report was released. On 11 August 1989 the Navy, acting on a recommendation from Miceli, recertified the "Iowa"-class battleship's 16-inch guns for operation.

On 15 July 1989 Milligan submitted his completed report on the explosion to his chain of command. The 60-page report found that the explosion was a deliberate act "most probably" committed by Hartwig using an electronic timer. The report concluded that the powder bags had been overrammed into the center gun by , but had been done so under Hartwig's direction in order to trigger the explosive timer that he had placed between two of the powder bags.

Donnell, on 28 July, endorsed Milligan's report, saying that the determination that Hartwig had sabotaged the gun "leaves the reader incredulous, yet the opinion is supported by facts and analysis from which it flows logically and inevitably". Donnell's superior, <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a> Commander Admiral <a href="Powell%20F.%20Carter%2C%20Jr.">Powell F. Carter, Jr.</a>, then endorsed the report, adding that the report showed that there were "substantial and serious failures by Moosally and Morse", and forwarded the report to the CNO, Carlisle Trost. Although Miceli had just announced that test results at <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Dahlgren</a> showed that an electronic timer had not caused the explosion, Trost endorsed the report on 31 August, stating that Hartwig was "the individual who had motive, knowledge, and physical position within the turret gun room to place a device in the powder train". Trost's endorsement cited Smith's statement to the NIS as further evidence that Hartwig was the culprit. Milligan's report was not changed to reflect Miceli's new theory that a chemical igniter, not an electrical timer, had been used to initiate the explosion.

Most of the victims' family members criticized the Navy's conclusions. Many of the families told media representatives of private misgivings that the victims had expressed to them about problems with training and the dangerous gunfire experiments occurring on "Iowa" before the explosion. Hartwig's family disputed the allegations that he was depressed and suicidal.

Several journalists immediately began questioning the results of Milligan's investigation. John Hall, a reporter for the "<a href="Richmond%20Times-Dispatch">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>", wrote a series of four articles beginning on 17 September that revealed that "Iowa" was engaged in illegal powder experiments when the gun blew up; that conflicts of interest were evident in the investigators assigned to the inquiry; that many of the ship's crew were improperly or inadequately trained; and that evidence did not support the Navy's theory that Hartwig caused the explosion. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> picked up Hall's story and it was run in other newspapers throughout the United States. Robert Becker and A. J. Plunkett from the <a href="Daily%20Press%20%28Virginia%29">"Daily Press"</a> wrote a lengthy story which criticized Milligan's report in detail. ABC reporter Robert Zelnick wrote an <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a> piece, which ran in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on 11 September, heavily criticizing the Navy for, in Zelnick's words, "scapegoating a dead seaman." Television <a href="newsmagazine">newsmagazine</a>s "<a href="20/20%20%28US%20television%20series%29">20/20</a>" and "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" both ran stories questioning the Navy's conclusions. "The Washington Post", in contrast, ran a story by George Wilson that generally supported the Navy's findings.

On 3 October, Donnell disciplined "Iowa"s officers in response to findings in Milligan's report. Moosally and Bob Finney, "Iowa"s operations officer, were given nonpunitive "letters of admonition" which were not placed in their permanent personnel records. Kissinger and Skelley received punitive letters of admonition which were placed in their records, as well as fines of $2,000 and $1,000 respectively. Donnell suspended both fines. Shortly thereafter, the Navy issued a statement explaining that the safety violations and training deficiencies found aboard "Iowa" during the investigation were unrelated to the explosion. Two weeks later, a panel of thirteen admirals recommended that Moosally be given another major command, stating that Moosally was "superbly fit" for such responsibility. Milligan was one of the admirals on the panel who supported the recommendation. After "60 Minutes" producer Charles Thompson asked Brent Baker and Chief of Naval Personnel <a href="Jeremy%20Michael%20Boorda">Jeremy Michael Boorda</a> about the recommendation, Moosally's name was withdrawn.

Ohio Senators <a href="Howard%20Metzenbaum">Howard Metzenbaum</a> and <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a> were concerned with the Navy's conclusions and arranged to hold a hearing on the Navy's investigation in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC), chaired by <a href="Sam%20Nunn">Sam Nunn</a>. Also, <a href="Member%20of%20Congress">Congresswoman</a> <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Oakar">Mary Rose Oakar</a> asked <a href="Nicholas%20Mavroules">Nicholas Mavroules</a>, chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Armed%20Services%20Subcommittee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Investigations">Investigations Subcommittee</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">House Armed Services Committee</a> to look into the Navy's findings and schedule hearings. John Glenn asked the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) to review the Navy's investigation into the explosions as well as to examine the unauthorized gunfire experiments and other unsafe practices that may have occurred on "Iowa" and review the Navy's utilization of the four "Iowa"-class battleships.

The first Senate hearing took place on 16 November 1989. Trost, Milligan, Miceli, and Robert Powers from the NIS testified at the hearing and were questioned by Senators Glenn, <a href="Alan%20Dixon">Alan Dixon</a>, <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, and <a href="James%20Exon">James Exon</a>. The senators questioned the Navy officers about the lack of adequate training on "Iowa"; the age and condition of the ship's powder; problems with the center gun's rammer; the illegal gunfire experiments; the methods used and conclusions reached in the investigation; and the series of leaks to the media from Navy and NIS personnel.

On 11 December 1989 Moosally testified before the SASC. He denied that "Iowa" had carried out illegal or unauthorized gunfire experiments. In response to questions from the senators, Moosally stated that he believed the explosion was an intentional act, but that he could not support Milligan's conclusion that Hartwig was the culprit. During the hearing, Sam Nunn announced that <a href="Sandia%20National%20Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had agreed to a request by the GAO to assist with the Navy's technical investigation to see if there might be a natural explanation for the explosion. Later, FBI agents Ault and Hazelwood appeared before the committee and answered questions about how they had prepared their equivocal death analysis on Hartwig. In addition, Truitt plus two other "Iowa" sailors and acquaintances of Hartwig testified that Hartwig was not suicidal and that the Navy was trying to "cover up" that the explosion was likely an accident.

On 12, 13, and 21 December, the House Armed Services Committee held its hearings into the Navy's investigation. The committee, including Mavroules, <a href="Les%20Aspin">Les Aspin</a>, <a href="Larry%20J.%20Hopkins">Larry Hopkins</a>, <a href="Norman%20Sisisky">Norman Sisisky</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Brennan">Joseph Brennan</a>, interviewed Donnell, Ault, Hazelwood, Milligan, Miceli, Truitt, Nimmich, and Richard Froede, the Armed Services Medical Examiner.

In early March 1990, the House Armed Services Committee released its report, titled "USS "Iowa" Tragedy: An Investigative Failure". The report criticized the Navy for failing to investigate every natural possible cause before concluding that the explosion was an intentional act. The report also criticized the Navy for allowing the turret and projectile to become contaminated; for permitting evidence to be thrown overboard; for endorsing Milligan's report prior to completing the technical investigation; and for neglecting to disclose the nature of the disagreement with the FBI laboratory over substances found on the projectile's rotating band. The FBI's equivocal death analysis was labeled the "single major fault of the investigation". The NIS's actions in the investigation were described as "flawed" and the NIS agents assigned to the case were criticized for unprofessional interviewing techniques and for leaking sensitive documents and inaccurate information. Finally, the report concluded that Milligan was unfit to oversee a major criminal investigation.

Forty scientists from Sandia, led by Richard Schwoebel, began an independent technical inquiry into the explosion on 7 December 1989. In order to investigate the Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical ignition device had been used to cause the explosion, Schwoebel asked Miceli to examine the projectiles removed from Turret Two's left and right guns to compare with the one taken from the center gun. Miceli informed Schwoebel that both projectiles had been misplaced and he could not locate them.

At a 16 January 1990 meeting with the Sandia scientists, Steve Mitchell, a technician from <a href="Indian%20Head%20Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center">Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center</a>, reported that his team had discovered that the propellant pellets making up the powder in "Iowa"s powder bags could fracture and give off hot fragments in drop tests, and that the fractured surface often had a burnt appearance and odor. At this point, according to Schwoebel, Miceli interjected and said, "This kind of thing can't be duplicated during the actual loading operation. This result is not relevant to the explosion." Mitchell added that his team had found it extremely unlikely that friction or static electricity could have ignited the center gunpowder bags. Tom Doran, a member of Miceli's team from Dahlgren, reported that his team had conducted tests to see if an overram could have caused the explosion, but revealed that the tests had used bags filled with wooden pellets with black powder pouches at the ends, not actual powder bags.

Sandia investigators asked if two similar explosions on the battleship could be related to the "Iowa" explosion. In 1924 and 1943, open breech explosions had occurred in the Turret Two center gun aboard "Mississippi", each time killing most of the crewmen in the turret. Miceli's team responded that the explosions were not related, because the "Mississippi" incidents were not actual explosions, but "intense burnings" of the powder which resulted from different causes than the "Iowa" incident. A staff officer from Naval Sea Systems Command, Rear Admiral Robert H. Ailes, told Sandia that the "Mississippi" explosions "would not be discussed".

Sandia's chemical and materials analysis group, headed by James Borders, investigated further the theory about a chemical igniter. Navy technicians stated that the discovery under the center gun's projectile's rotating band of minute steel-wool fibers that were encrusted with <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, a fragment of polyethylene terephthalate (commonly used in plastic bags), and different glycols, including brake fluid, <a href="hypochlorite">hypochlorite</a>, antifreeze, and <a href="Brylcreem">Brylcreem</a> together indicated the use of a chemical igniter. The Navy was unable to locate the steel-wool fiber evidence for Borders to examine. No untouched portions of the rotating band remained and Sandia was provided with a section to examine that had already been examined by the FBI. Borders' team examined the rotating band and did not find any traces of polyethylene terephthalate. The team found that the glycols present actually came from the Break-Free cleaning solution which had been dumped into the center gun's barrel to help free the projectile after the explosion. The team also found that calcium and chlorine were present in "Iowa"s other gun turrets and in the gun turrets of the other "Iowa"-class battleships, and that this was indicative of routine exposure to a maritime environment. Borders concluded that ordinary sources accounted for all of the "foreign materials" found by the Navy on the center gun projectile, and that the theory that a chemical igniter had been used to cause the explosion was extremely doubtful.

Karl Schuler, a member of Sandia's team, determined that the five powder bags in Turret Two's center gun had been rammed into the gun, farther than the that the Navy had estimated in Milligan's report. After spending 50 hours exploring the ramifications on a <a href="Cray">Cray</a> supercomputer, Schuler concluded that this overram, combined with the of pressure produced by the rammer, likely compressed the powder bags to the point that they had ignited. Mel Baer, a Sandia team member, determined that the explosion likely occurred in the vicinity of the first (most forward) powder bag, corroborating the Navy's conclusion on this point.
Another group of Sandia investigators, directed by Paul Cooper, conducted 450 drop tests using small bags of D-846 powder in late March to early May 1990. The team determined that the "tare" or "trim" layer (a small amount of powder placed at the end of each bag to equalize the bag's weight, inserted in the mid-1980s when the powder was mixed and rebagged under Miceli's direction) would often ignite when compressed at high speed. Cooper found that the burning fragments did not ignite adjacent powder in the same bag, but instead would burn through the bag material and ignite the adjacent bag's black powder patch and thereby ignite the rest of the bags. The week of 7 May, Schwoebel asked Miceli to conduct drop tests at Dahlgren using five actual bags of powder compressed into a steel cylinder of the same diameter as a 16-inch gun. Miceli responded that Cooper's finding "has no relation to actual 16-inch gun conditions" and refused repeated requests from Sandia to conduct the tests.

Concerned that Miceli's refusal to conduct full-scale drop tests was placing Navy gun crews at risk, on 11 May Schwoebel contacted Rick DeBobes, Nunn's counsel for the SASC. On 14 May 1990, a letter from Nunn was sent to Trost requesting that the Navy conduct the tests as requested by Sandia and that Sandia be allowed to observe the tests. That same day, Miceli's supervisor, Vice Admiral Peter Hekman, commander of Sea Systems Command, called Sandia's president, Al Narath, and told him that the Navy would conduct the full-scale drop tests as requested and Sandia was invited to participate.

The drops tests were conducted at Dahlgren under Miceli's and Tom Doran's direction. The tests consisted of vertically stacking five D-846 powder bags under an weight and dropping them three feet onto a steel plate to simulate a high-speed overram in a 16-inch gun barrel. On 24 May 1990 on the 18th drop test, witnessed by Cooper and Schuler, the powder bags exploded, destroying the entire testing apparatus. Miceli immediately told Hekman, who notified the Navy's leadership to halt any further use of 16-inch guns and to reopen the Navy's investigation.

The next day Schwoebel, Schuler, Cooper, and Borders publicly briefed the SASC in the <a href="Hart%20Senate%20Office%20Building">Hart Senate Office Building</a> on the results of their investigation, stating that, in Sandia's opinion, the explosion had occurred because of an overram of the powder caused by either an accident due to human error or an equipment failure. In his closing remarks the committee chairman, Sam Nunn, rejected Milligan's finding that the explosion had resulted from an intentional act. Nunn added that Milligan's conclusions were not supported "by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence". Nunn later criticized the NIS, saying, "The Navy's whole investigative technique here should be under serious question."

Also testifying before the Senate on 25 May was Frank C. Conahan from the GAO. Conahan reported that the GAO had found that the "Iowa"-class battleships were not assigned an equal share of personnel in comparison with other Navy ships, especially in the main gun department. The GAO observed that the <a href="nonjudicial%20punishment">nonjudicial punishment</a> rate on the battleships was 25% higher than for the rest of the Navy. Conahan concluded by suggesting that, because of the issues surrounding the limited deployment availability of the battleships, they "seem to be top candidates for deactivation as we look for ways to scale back US forces."

After the Senate hearing, the Secretary of the Navy, <a href="Henry%20L.%20Garrett%20III">Henry L. Garrett III</a>, reopened the investigation. Nunn, via DeBobes, directed that no one associated with the first investigation, especially Milligan or Miceli, be involved with the second. In spite of this request, the Navy chose Miceli to lead the new investigation but continuously report on his progress to a technical oversight board. On 30 June 1990 <a href="Frank%20Kelso">Frank Kelso</a> relieved Trost as CNO and <a href="Jerome%20L.%20Johnson">Jerome L. Johnson</a> replaced Edney as vice-chief. Shortly thereafter, DeBobes visited Kelso in the Pentagon and suggested that it was not a good idea to leave Miceli in charge of the reinvestigation. Kelso listened but declined to remove Miceli. Sandia, at the Senate's request, remained involved in the investigation. The Navy stated that it expected the reinvestigation to be completed in six months.

In June and July 1990, Miceli's team conducted overram tests using a full-scale mock-up of a gun breech. The tests were conducted at rammer speeds of 2, 4, 8, and . One of the tests at caused an explosion in the breech. Cooper and Schuler, who were observing the tests, reported to Schwoebel that, in their opinion, Miceli tried to limit the scope of the testing and conduct most of the ram tests at lower speeds. The Sandia team members also noted that Miceli refused to allow his civilian technicians to test alternate overram scenarios and appeared, by various means, to deliberately delay the progress of the investigation.

During further overram testing by Miceli's team, four more explosions occurred. Tom Doran, a civilian member of Miceli's team, told Schwoebel on 18 July that his tests had shown that overram explosions could occur much more easily and at slower speeds depending on the configuration of loose pellets in the powder bags. Doran reported that Miceli then ordered him not to conduct further testing along that avenue of inquiry.

In August 1990, the Navy lifted the restriction on firing 16-inch guns. The Navy removed the trim layers from the 16-inch powder bags, added a color-coded system on the 16-inch gun ram to indicate the slow-speed ram position, and instructed gun crews to conduct additional training on rammer operations.

In November 1990, Cooper discovered the two missing Turret Two left and right projectiles in a warehouse at Dahlgren. Cooper and other Sandia scientists examined the shells and found the same iron fibers and chemicals on the two shells that had been found on the center gun projectile. Said Schwoebel, "It should have ended the Navy's case against Hartwig right then and there." The Navy disagreed that the materials found on all three shells were the same.

On 3 July 1991 Miceli briefed the NAVSEA technical oversight board and stated that his investigation supported the Navy's original theory that the explosion was an intentional act. Although Sandia representatives were present at Miceli's briefing, the board members did not invite Sandia to rebut or comment on Miceli's assertions.

Sandia's final findings were submitted to the Senate in August 1991 and included in the GAO's report on its investigation. Schwoebel's team concluded that the fibers and various chemical constituents found by the Navy on the center gun projectile were unrelated to the explosion. The team found that an overram had occurred, but could not determine the speed at which the rammer had compressed the powder bags against the projectile. Sandia found that the overram had likely caused the explosion and that the probability was 16.6% of selecting a group of five-bag charges from the propellant lot aboard "Iowa" that was sensitive to ignition by overram. The report stated that, in Sandia's opinion, the explosion had occurred immediately with the overram—that there was no delay as theorized by the Navy. Sandia theorized that the overram may have occurred due to inadequate training of some members of the center gun crew; a poorly conceived, briefed, and executed firing plan that contributed to confusion; and—possibly—a malfunction of the rammer. Sandia's report concluded that the probability of powder ignition in the 16-inch guns by an overram was such that measures needed to be taken to ensure that overrams were precluded at any speed. The GAO report concluded that the possibility of an overram-caused explosion was a "previously unrecognized safety problem". Schwoebel's team also briefed Admiral Kelso at the Pentagon on their findings.

On 17 October 1991, 17 months after the Navy reopened the investigation, Kelso conducted a press conference at the Pentagon to announce the results of the Navy's reinvestigation. Kelso noted that the Navy had spent a total of $25 million on the investigation. He stated that the Navy had uncovered no evidence to suggest that the gun had been operated improperly, nor had it established a plausible accidental cause for the explosion. Kelso stated, "The initial investigation was an honest attempt to weigh impartially all the evidence as it existed at the time. And indeed, despite the Sandia theory and almost two years of subsequent testing, a substantial body of scientific and expert evidence continue to support the initial investigation finding that no plausible accidental cause can be established." Kelso added that the Navy had also found no evidence that the explosion was caused intentionally. He further announced that he had directed the Navy to never again use an informal board composed of a single officer to investigate such an incident. Kelso concluded by offering "sincere regrets" to the family of Clayton Hartwig and apologies to the families of those who died, "that such a long period has passed, and despite all efforts no certain answer regarding the cause of this terrible tragedy can be found".

Turret Two was trained forward with its own mechanism after the explosion, and superficial repairs were conducted. All the related repair pieces were stored inside the turret and the turret was sealed shut. The turret was never put back into operation.

"Iowa" was decommissioned in Norfolk on 26 October 1990 and became part of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Reserve%20Fleet">National Defense Reserve Fleet</a>. Around the same time, from August 1990 to February 1991, the "Iowa"-class battleships and were deployed to the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. The two battleships fired 1,182 16-inch shells in support of <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> combat operations without mishap.

As part of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Reserve%20Fleet">National Defense Reserve Fleet</a>, "Iowa" was berthed at the <a href="Naval%20Education%20and%20Training%20Center">Naval Education and Training Center</a> in Newport from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when she began her journey under tow to <a href="California">California</a>. The ship was stored at <a href="Suisun%20Bay">Suisun Bay</a> near <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> from 21 April 2001 to 28 October 2011 as part of the <a href="Reserve%20Fleet">Reserve Fleet</a> there. In May 2012, "Iowa" was towed to <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20Los%20Angeles">San Pedro, California</a>, and is now a <a href="museum%20ship">floating museum</a>.

Milligan and Miceli retired from the Navy in 1992 as a rear admiral and captain, respectively. Milligan later taught economics at the <a href="Naval%20Postgraduate%20School">Naval Postgraduate School</a>, then became vice president of a national insurance company.

Captain Moosally retired at that rank in May 1990. At his change of command ceremony on "Iowa" on 4 May, Moosally criticized the Navy for mismanaging the investigation, saying that the investigators were "people who, in their rush to manage the "Iowa" problem, forgot about doing the right thing for the "Iowa" crew". Later, Moosally began working for <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a> in the Washington, D.C. area. In 2001, Moosally told "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", "Only God knows what really happened in that turret. We're never really going to know for sure."

Skelley was transferred to the battleship "Wisconsin" in late 1990 or early 1991 and helped direct that ship's gunnery participation during the Gulf War. He retired from the Navy in the fall of 1998.

Meyer resigned in 1991. In his resignation letter, he complained about the Navy's investigation into the explosion, and Miceli's and other officers' roles in what Meyer claimed was a cover-up. The letter was passed to Vice Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda, then chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, who requested, unsuccessfully, that Meyer withdraw it. When Meyer subsequently received his discharge papers, he discovered that statements in his letter criticizing the Navy and certain officers had been removed. Following assignment to the Middle East Force during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Meyer followed through with his resignation, and matriculated at the Indiana University School of Law at Bloomington. Meyer later served as the director of civilian reprisal investigations for the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Inspector%20General%2C%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense">Inspector General</a> for the U.S. Department of Defense. As one of two director-level leaders of the <a href="The%20Department%20of%20Defense%20Whistleblower%20Program">Department of Defense Whistleblower Program</a>, he conducted and oversaw allegations of whistleblower reprisal made by DoD civilian employees and submitted to the Inspector General.

Kendall Truitt was denied reenlistment, reportedly in retaliation for his speaking to the press and defending Hartwig. He was discharged on 9 February 1990. He continued his effort to clear Hartwig's name in statements to the media.

"The New York Times" in 1993 severely criticized the U.S. Navy for a series of botched investigations, including the <a href="Tailhook%20scandal">Tailhook scandal</a>, the "Iowa" explosion, <a href="Clayton%20J.%20Lonetree">security breaches</a> at the U.S. embassy in <a href="Moscow">Moscow, Russia</a>, and a problematic investigation into the murder of a homosexual sailor in <a href="Yokosuka%20%28city%29">Yokosuka, Japan</a>. The newspaper stated, "Each fumbled inquiry may have exposed a different U.S. Navy foible. The repeated bungling suggests a systemic problem in the Naval Investigative Service—and a management failure at the highest levels."

Schwoebel, in 1999, published a book titled "Explosion Aboard the Iowa" on his experience directing Sandia's investigation into the explosion. In the book, Schwoebel concluded that, in his opinion, the "Iowa" incident and aftermath illustrated that high-consequence incidents should be investigated by an independent group instead of by a self-assessment, as had occurred with the U.S. Navy investigating itself in this case. He also observed that abuse results when a powerful organization attempts to manipulate the press, as the U.S. Navy had apparently tried to do through leaks of information about the investigation. Furthermore, Schwoebel noted the unfair and indiscriminate recitation by the press of the sensational material leaked by the U.S. Navy. Finally, he observed that the U.S. Navy was lacking a due process in military justice as it related to deceased personnel.

Also in 1999, Charles Thompson published a book, titled <a href="A%20Glimpse%20of%20Hell%20%28book%29">"A Glimpse of Hell: The Explosion on the USS Iowa and Its Cover-Up"</a>, documenting his investigation into the explosion and its aftermath. The book was extremely critical of many of "Iowa"s crewmembers, as well as many of those involved with the subsequent U.S. Navy investigation, and the NCIS (formerly NIS). Thompson stated that after the book was published, a previously scheduled invitation to speak at the U.S. Navy's <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">National Museum</a> was rescinded, his book was banned from being sold in the museum's book store, and <a href="Base%20exchange">Navy exchange</a> stores at bases throughout the world were forbidden from selling his book.

Alan E. Diehl, a former safety manager for the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">U.S. Navy</a>, described the USS "Iowa" incident in his 2003 book "Silent Knights: Blowing the Whistle on Military Accidents and Their Cover-Ups". Diehl called the incident and its aftermath the worst military cover-up he had ever seen.

An of the TV series "<a href="JAG%20%28TV%20series%29">JAG</a>" was based upon the incident.

On 19 April 1991, the Hartwig family sued the Navy for "<a href="intentional%20infliction%20of%20emotional%20distress">intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress</a>" under the <a href="Federal%20Tort%20Claims%20Act">Federal Tort Claims Act</a>. On 30 June 1992 the Hartwigs added another count of emotional distress to the lawsuit, after the Navy sent a letter to Hartwig's parents inviting the dead sailor to join the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">U.S. Naval Reserve</a>. The Hartwigs sued for emotional distress in order to avoid the limitations imposed by the <a href="Feres%20v.%20United%20States">"Feres" Doctrine</a>. The DoD asked for a dismissal of the Hartwigs' suit on grounds of <a href="sovereign%20immunity">sovereign immunity</a>, but in May 1993, US <a href="United%20States%20district%20court%23United%20States%20district%20judges">District Judge</a> Paul R. Matia ruled in Cleveland that the Hartwigs' suit could proceed. After <a href="Discovery%20%28law%29">discovery</a>, the government again moved for dismissal. On 26 January 1999 <a href="United%20States%20magistrate%20judge">Magistrate Judge</a> David Perelman issued a recommendation to grant dismissal because several years of discovery had revealed that defamation was essential to the Hartwigs' claims, and that pure defamation claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The Hartwig family filed objections, but on 10 November 1999 District Judge Solomon Oliver, Jr. adopted the recommendation to dismiss, ruling that "however hurtful the government's action may have been, they cannot form the basis of a claim against the United States."

The Hartwigs sued NBC News for $10 million for emotional distress, claiming that the reports by Fred Francis had falsely portrayed Hartwig as a suicidal mass murderer. NBC responded by claiming that it could not be held liable, because its information had come directly, via leaks, from the NIS. A federal judge dismissed the suit.

Thirty-eight of the other "Iowa" victims' family members filed suit against the Navy, seeking $2.35 billion in damages for the death of their family members in the explosion. Citing the "Feres" case, US District Judge Claude M. Hilton in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a>, summarily dismissed the suit.

In March 2001 Captains Moosally, Miceli, Morse, and CDR Finney filed suit against "Glimpse of Hell" author Thompson, his publisher, <a href="W.%20W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W.W. Norton</a>, and Dan Meyer, who the <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a>s stated provided much of the information used in the book, for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. In April 2001 Mortensen filed a separate suit for the same causes of action.

In April 2004, the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Supreme%20Court">South Carolina Supreme Court</a> dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. In February 2007 the suit was settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said that they felt "totally vindicated". W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending a letter to the former officers stating, in part, "To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family."

A memorial to the 47 sailors killed in the explosion was erected at "Iowa Point" on Norfolk Naval Station. The project was overseen by regional Naval Commander RADM Paul Moses and his public affairs staff. Each year after the accident on 19 April a memorial service is held at Iowa Point in memory of those killed in the explosion.

Since her decommissioning, the Battleship "Iowa" Museum (San Pedro, Calif.) hosts an annual memorial ceremony for the deceased crewmen of Turret 2. Preparations are already underway for the April 19, 2019 ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the incident. That official memorial will occur aboard the ship in San Pedro, officiated by the Veteran's Association of the USS Iowa. A similar event will occur the same day at Iowa Point in Norfolk, Va.

Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment

The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, most commonly known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> unit of riflemen in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. The American <a href="Long%20rifle">rifle</a> units complemented the predominant, <a href="musket">musket</a>-equipped, <a href="line%20infantry">line infantry</a> forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward <a href="skirmisher">skirmisher</a>s and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation was not nearly as structured as that of the line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered <a href="line%20%28formation%29">linear formations</a>. The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions.

The Maryland and Virginia Rifle <a href="Regiment">Regiment</a> consisted of nine <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a>—four from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state composition of the new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an <a href="Extra%20Continental%20regiments%20and%20Additional%20Continental%20regiments">Extra Continental regiment</a>.
Because most of the newly formed regiment surrendered to British and German forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Washington">Battle of Fort Washington</a> on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it marked the end of the regiment as a combat entity, a significant portion of the unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout most of the remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a>'s elite <a href="Morgan%27s%20Riflemen">Provisional Rifle Corps</a> at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at <a href="Fort%20Pitt%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Fort Pitt</a>, headquarters of the Continental Army's <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Western Department</a>, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of the Continental Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war.

During the American Revolutionary War, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> directed the organization of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776. The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in Maryland and Virginia by decree of Congress in mid-1775, and six new companies—two from Maryland and four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. <a href="Michael%20Cresap">Michael Cresap</a>, Thomas Price, and <a href="Beverley%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Hugh Stephenson</a>. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment, which was originally the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Rifle%20Regiment">Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment</a>. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was an <a href="Extra%20Continental%20regiments%20and%20Additional%20Continental%20regiments">Extra Continental regiment</a> because of its two-state composition. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the Continental Army). The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment's <a href="field%20officer">field officer</a>s were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders <a href="Moses%20Rawlings">Moses Rawlings</a> of Cresap's company and <a href="Otho%20Holland%20Williams">Otho Holland Williams</a> of Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended to the end of the year. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, Maryland, and Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.

By early November 1776, the majority of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the <a href="New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey%20campaign">New York and New Jersey campaign</a>. They were initially stationed at <a href="Fort%20Washington%20%28New%20York%29">Fort Washington</a> on Manhattan Island and nearby <a href="Fort%20Lee%20Historic%20Park">Fort Lee</a> on the opposite side of the Hudson River. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Washington">Battle of Fort Washington</a>. The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessian</a> troops. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced. About 140 of the regiment's officers and enlisted men—one-third of the unit's total complement of about 420 men—were not present at the battle, however, because they were still completing organization and recruiting. A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining active force, which continued to serve with the Main Army. On December 1, the first day of the army's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington, Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit's highest ranking officers still free—Capts. Alexander Lawson Smith and <a href="Gabriel%20Long">Gabriel Long</a>. Smith's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment, whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long's command.

The regiment's two composite companies served with the Main Army during its retreat across New Jersey in late 1776, in the ensuing Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Trenton</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Princeton">Princeton</a> in Brig. Gen. <a href="Hugh%20Mercer">Hugh Mercer</a>'s <a href="Brigade">Brigade</a>, and in the early 1777 skirmishing in northern New Jersey, a period termed the <a href="Forage%20War">Forage War</a>. While in winter quarters at <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown</a> during the winter and spring of 1777, the two-company force and other riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia Line regiments supported detached elements of line infantry units in front-line positions and conducted patrols in northern New Jersey, primarily to keep the enemy's aggressive foraging activities in check. Because the two units under Captains Smith and Long provided an experienced, if small, force, Washington also used them to bolster the new <a href="11th%20Virginia%20Regiment">11th Virginia Regiment</a> commanded by Col. <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> after its arrival at Morristown in early April by formally attaching them to this Virginia regiment. Washington's decision to join the two composite companies with the 11th Virginia Regiment was based on Morgan's earlier direct association with the original three independent Continental rifle companies of 1775 that formed the core element of Rawlings' regiment. Inasmuch as the attachment of one military unit to another was technically a temporary arrangement, however, the permanent unit of Smith's and Long's composite companies remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. The first muster rolls of the two companies taken after the Battle of Fort Washington, both dated May 16, 1777, were compiled by the army staff as a result of the attachment process and show that the units comprised about 110 officers and enlisted men on active duty in the spring of 1777. The rolls also document that the units had lost a number of men over the winter months following the battle, primarily through desertion and a few deaths due to illness or wounds.

The success of these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled with the arrival of large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create additional provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the <a href="Morgan%27s%20Riflemen">Provisional Rifle Corps</a>, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. The men from the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; with the exception of a single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in the Rifle Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Battles of Saratoga</a>.

Most members of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, however, were not chosen for the Rifle Corps and remained with the Main Army. The Marylanders in Smith's composite company served with the 11th Virginia Regiment in the 3rd Virginia Brigade at the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Brandywine</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Germantown</a>, as well as at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a> after they were administratively attached to the <a href="4th%20Maryland%20Regiment">4th Maryland Regiment</a> of the 2nd Maryland Brigade at the end of the 1777 campaign season. The Virginians in Long's composite company remained attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment and fought at the same engagements in 1777 and 1778. Lt. (later Capt.) Philip Slaughter was the acting commander of the company during Long's nearly two-year attachment to the Rifle Corps and its permanent commander after Long's resignation.

Soon after Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, a Marylander, was exchanged from British captivity in late December 1777 or January 1778, the <a href="Board%20of%20War">Board of War</a>, at the request of the Maryland state government, assigned him command of the prisoner-of-war camp at <a href="Fort%20Frederick%20State%20Park">Fort Frederick</a>, Maryland, and its state militia guard. The elements of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in the field continued to be led by the company commanders until recruiting could bring the regiment up to greater strength. Maj. Otho Holland Williams, exchanged on January 16, 1778 (likely with Rawlings), had been promoted to colonel of the <a href="6th%20Maryland%20Regiment">6th Maryland Regiment</a> in December 1776 while a prisoner of war; he took command of this unit upon his release. The position of major in the reduced Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was never refilled.

In the late spring of 1778, Rawlings began marshaling his regiment, including returning prisoners of war and new recruits, to reestablish its full complement. His efforts met with only limited success, however, despite Washington's request to Maryland governor <a href="Thomas%20Johnson%20%28jurist%29">Thomas Johnson</a> in late December 1777 in anticipation of Rawlings' imminent exchange "that the most early and vigorous measures will be adopted, not only to make [Rawlings'] Regiment more respectable, but compleat ." Moreover, in early October 1778 Congress permitted Rawlings and his officers to recruit outside Maryland, with each new enlistee being officially entitled to the enlistment bonus and clothing allowance of his own state's line organization. Implementation of this unusual ruling, however, added few men to the unit, reflecting the Continental Army's increasing difficulty in recruiting by this time of the war. The few recruiting records for the unit that exist indicate that by the end of 1778, Rawlings' force of Continental regulars at Fort Frederick probably included no more than 30 to 40 new enlistees.

Washington initiated more definitive measures to strengthen the regiment in early 1779. At his request, Congress authorized on January 23 the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment to be reorganized into three companies, recruited to full strength, and reassigned from Fort Frederick to <a href="Fort%20Pitt%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Fort Pitt</a>, headquarters of the Continental Army's <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Western Department</a>. The reorganization, which was implemented on March 21, served to supplement forces engaged in the defense of frontier settlements of present-day western Pennsylvania and vicinity from Indian raids that had started in early 1777. In mid-1778, after more than a year of these attacks, largely by warriors of British-allied <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> tribes and <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> forces, Washington commenced a concerted effort to neutralize the threat to the backcountry settlements of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia—the war's western front. In support of the reorganization process, on February 16, 1779, Washington ordered that all the regiment's detached members in the Main Army be reincorporated into the unit. Pursuant to Washington's order, the enlisted men in Smith's composite company who were attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment rejoined Rawlings' command. In contrast, the Virginians of Long's composite company already had been all but formally incorporated into the 11th Virginia Regiment by order of the Virginia state government in February 1777. (Because Long's unit was a component of an <a href="Extra%20Continental%20regiments%20and%20Additional%20Continental%20regiments">Extra Continental regiment</a> and therefore had no administrative connection to an individual state, the Virginia state government had exceeded its authority in this action, which was technically only within the purview of Congress. Washington tacitly accepted the arrangement, but the process was probably not formalized until the reorganization and redesignation of the 11th Virginia Regiment as the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779.) Moreover, the enlisted men of Smith's and Long's companies who were still attached to the Provisional Rifle Corps, which was not part of the Main Army at this time, remained in that unit until mid-1779, at which time they left the service because their three-year enlistment periods had expired. Rawlings' force therefore now consisted of almost all Marylanders and was variously identified as the "Maryland Corps," "Maryland Rifle Corps," and "Maryland Independent Corps" during its service on the western frontier. The unit, however, remained outside the state line organization, a source of great frustration for its officers. Because no unit-redesignation orders accompanied the reorganization orders, the unit's formal name remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment despite significant variations from the unit's original 1776 configuration.

After recruitment of the three companies had been no more than partially completed, Rawlings' regiment set off for Fort Pitt, arriving there in late May 1779. The three companies consisted of about 100 enlisted men, well below the prescribed total of about 60 enlisted men per company in a Continental Army line infantry regiment in 1779. Moreover, a month after its arrival, the unit lost almost half of its troop strength because the three-year enlistment periods of those men who had joined the regiment during its organization in mid-1776 had terminated. To further complicate matters, Rawlings resigned his command of the regiment on June 2, primarily because of his frustration over not being able to fully rebuild the unit, and did not accompany his men. He remained the commandant of Fort Frederick and subsequently served as Deputy Commissary of Prisoners for Maryland. Capt. Alexander Lawson Smith also did not proceed to Fort Pitt with the riflemen. He likely stayed with the 4th Maryland Regiment of the Main Army in a continued attached capacity until Congress approved his resignation from "the regiment formerly Rawlins " in September 1780. The regiment was now commanded by senior captain Thomas Beall and later Capt. <a href="Adamson%20Tannehill">Adamson Tannehill</a>, both of whom had been with the unit since its inception.

The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment complemented the existing garrison at Fort Pitt: the <a href="8th%20Pennsylvania%20Regiment">8th Pennsylvania</a> and 9th (formerly <a href="13th%20Virginia%20Regiment">13th</a>) Virginia Regiments. The men of these Pennsylvania and Virginia line infantry units had been recruited from the central and western frontier counties of the two states and were assigned to the army's <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Western Department</a> while at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>, reflecting a clear logic on Washington's part. With the arrival of Rawlings' regiment, Western Department commander Col. <a href="Daniel%20Brodhead%20IV">Daniel Brodhead</a> now led a force of largely frontier raised men experienced in Indian-style woodlands warfare. In his most notable tactical achievement, Brodhead headed a campaign of about 600 of his Continental regulars, which included the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, local militia, and volunteers to the upper waters of the <a href="Allegheny%20River">Allegheny River</a> in August and September 1779, where they destroyed the villages and crops of hostile <a href="Mingo">Mingo</a> and <a href="Lenape">Munsee</a> Indians. Brodhead's expedition was part of Washington's wide-ranging, coordinated offensive of the summer of 1779 that also included the larger, concurrent <a href="Sullivan%20Expedition">Sullivan Campaign</a> led by Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Sullivan%20%28general%29">John Sullivan</a> and Brig. Gen. <a href="James%20Clinton">James Clinton</a> against enemy <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> and <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> units in southern and western New York State. From mid-1779 until late 1780, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was primarily deployed in detachments to support line infantry contingents at several of the frontier outposts in the general vicinity of Fort Pitt, including <a href="Fort%20Laurens">Fort Laurens</a>, <a href="Fort%20McIntosh%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Fort McIntosh</a>, and <a href="Fort%20Henry%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Fort Henry</a> (Wheeling) in what is now eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northernmost West Virginia, respectively.

Change in command of the regiment occurred for the third time in late 1780. Under continual pressure to maintain sufficient troop strength in the unit, regimental commander Capt. Thomas Beall ran afoul of army regulations and Western Department commander Brodhead by approving the enlistment of a British prisoner of war in February 1780. Beall tried to rectify his lapse in judgment by discharging the recruit, although after he had already been given his recruitment bounty and service clothes. On August 14, 1780, at Fort Pitt, Captain Beall was tried by court-martial, found guilty of "discharging a Soldier after having been duly inlisted and receiving his regimental cloathing through private and interested views thereby defrauding the United States," and on October 13, was dismissed from the service. Capt. <a href="Adamson%20Tannehill">Adamson Tannehill</a> succeeded Beall as commander of the regiment for the remaining few months of the unit's existence.

On November 1, 1780, Washington issued orders approved by Congress that specified plans for the comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1, 1781. All Additional and Extra Continental regiments, such as the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, that had not been annexed to a state line organization were disbanded by that date. The much-diminished unit comprised only 2 officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780. The officers received discharges on January 1, 1781, and the enlisted men of the unit were transferred to the <a href="Maryland%20Line">Maryland Line</a>. Relocation of the men from their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments, however, was not completed until November 1781, at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process.

The lineage of the regiment's Virginia elements is carried on by the <a href="201st%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">201st Field Artillery Regiment (United States)</a>.

The track's turns are <a href="Banked%20turn">banked</a> at 24 degrees; both the <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">front stretch</a> (the location of the finish line) and the back stretch (opposite the front) have a five-degree banking.

Before the race, <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 1,881 <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20points%20scoring%20systems%231975%E2%80%932010">points</a>, with teammate <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a> in second and <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> third. <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> were fourth and fifth, and <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a>, <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a>, <a href="Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> and <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> rounded out the top twelve. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a> with 96 points, 35 points ahead of its rival <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> in second. <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> with 52 points was 19 points ahead of <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> in the battle for third place. <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a> was the race's defending champion.

The Coca-Cola 600 was conceived by race car driver <a href="Curtis%20Turner">Curtis Turner</a>, who built the Charlotte Motor Speedway. It was first held in 1960 in an attempt by NASCAR to stage a <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> weekend race to compete with the open-wheel <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a>; the two races were held together on the same day starting from 1974. The race is the longest in terms of distance on the NASCAR calendar, and is considered by several drivers to be one of the sport's most important races alongside the <a href="Daytona%20500">Daytona 500</a>, the <a href="Brickyard%20400">Brickyard 400</a> and the <a href="Bojangles%27%20Southern%20500">Southern 500</a>. The long distance makes it the most physically demanding event in NASCAR, and teams adapt to changing track conditions because the race occurs between late afternoon and evening. It was known as the World 600 until 1984 when <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a> purchased the naming rights to the race and renamed it the Coca-Cola World 600 in 1985. It has been called the Coca-Cola 600 every year since 1986 except for 2002 when the name changed to Coca-Cola Racing Family 600.

In preparation for the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on May 7–8, 2007, to allow teams to prepare for the May races at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Sessions began at 2:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">Eastern Daylight Time</a> (EDT) on May 7 and concluded at 9:00 p.m. On May 8, sessions started at 1:00 p.m. and stopped at 9:00 p.m. Eighty-two cars participated in the May 7 afternoon session; <a href="Martin%20Truex%2C%20Jr.">Martin Truex, Jr.</a> was quickest with a speed of and <a href="David%20Stremme">David Stremme</a> had the highest speed of the two days at in the evening session. Towards the end of the second session, Hamlin lost control of his car and made heavy contact with an outside <a href="SAFER%20barrier">SAFER barrier</a>; he was evaluated at the infield care center and was later released to continue testing. During the third session with eighty-four cars, <a href="Jeremy%20Mayfield">Jeremy Mayfield</a> had the fastest speed of and Kurt Busch set the fastest speed of in the fourth and final session held in the evening. <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a> spun but avoided contact with the wall.

There was one change of driver before the race. Starting at the 2007 Coca-Cola 600, <a href="1988%20NASCAR%20Winston%20Cup%20Series">1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series</a> champion <a href="Bill%20Elliott">Bill Elliott</a> returned to NASCAR on a part-time schedule for <a href="Wood%20Brothers%20Racing">Wood Brothers Racing</a>, replacing the team's regular driver <a href="Ken%20Schrader">Ken Schrader</a>, who drove in the season's first eleven races. Elliott was eligible to use six <a href="NASCAR%20rules%20and%20regulations%23Provisional%20rule">Champion's Provisionals</a> if the need arose. Elliott was looking forward to returning to racing: "I was pretty honored to get a call from the Wood Brothers to drive the 21 car. I've seen them struggle the last few weeks, being outside the top 35, and it breaks my heart to see them miss races. I hope I can get in the car, get us qualified well every week and see what we can make up in the points battle along the way."

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race; one on Thursday and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, the second 50 minutes and the third 60 minutes. In the first practice session, <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a> was fastest with a time of 29.697 seconds; Kahne was second and <a href="Ricky%20Rudd">Ricky Rudd</a> third. Johnson was fourth, and <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a> placed fifth. Kenseth, <a href="Joe%20Nemechek">Joe Nemechek</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a>, <a href="Scott%20Riggs">Scott Riggs</a> and <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> completed the session's top-ten drivers. <a href="Sterling%20Marlin">Sterling Marlin</a> hit one of the walls lining the track and switched to a back-up car. <a href="Michael%20Waltrip">Michael Waltrip</a> did not need to switch cars after a similar collision.

Although forty-nine cars were entered in the qualifier; according to NASCAR's <a href="NASCAR%20rules%20and%20regulations%23Qualifying%20procedure">qualifying procedure</a> only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who set their laps late in qualifying had an advantage because the track was at its coolest. <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> clinched his thirty-ninth <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> of his career, with a time of 29.140 seconds. He was joined on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">grid</a>'s front row by his <a href="Team%20Penske">Penske Racing South</a> teammate Kurt Busch, and was the second-to-last driver to record his lap. Sadler qualified third, <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a> fourth, and Kenseth started fifth. Hamlin, Rudd, <a href="Dave%20Blaney">Dave Blaney</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> and Stremme rounded out the top ten qualifiers. <a href="Jeff%20Green%20%28racing%20driver%29">Jeff Green</a> wrecked his car in the second turn while on a lap and used a provisional to qualify. The six drivers that failed to qualify were <a href="Kevin%20Lepage">Kevin Lepage</a>, <a href="David%20Reutimann">David Reutimann</a> (who crashed on his lap) Waltrip (who lost control of his car in the second turn on his second qualifying lap, tearing off a front tire after hitting the inside wall and made contact with the wall a second time before stopping), <a href="Mike%20Bliss">Mike Bliss</a>, <a href="Paul%20Menard">Paul Menard</a> and <a href="Ward%20Burton">Ward Burton</a>. After the qualifier, Newman said he felt pressure to achieve Penske's Racing South's first victory at Charlotte Motor Speedway: "He's only been trying here for like 20 years, so yeah it would be special. It's been something that weighs on the drivers and the teams". He also said he felt he could have recorded a faster lap time and was worried about teammate Kurt Busch's qualifying form.

On Saturday afternoon in sunny and warm weather conditions, Newman was fastest in the second practice session with a time of 30.562 seconds, ahead of Sadler and Kurt Busch. <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> was fourth-fastest; <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> was fifth and Earnhardt sixth. Edwards, Rudd, McMurray and Kahne followed in the top ten. During the session, teams were scuffing their tires; in the first minute, Bowyer crashed after he spun in turn two and switched to a back-up car in which he set five more lap times. Shortly afterward, Nemechek spun after exiting the second turn but avoided damaging his car. Later that day, Edwards paced the final practice session with a time of 30.043 seconds; Biffle was second and Newman third. Sadler was fourth-fastest, ahead of <a href="J.%20J.%20Yeley">J. J. Yeley</a> and Truex. Kurt Busch was seventh-fastest, Jeff Gordon eighth, Kenseth ninth, and Jeff Burton tenth. Kyle Busch damaged his right-rear quarter after hitting the outside wall, but did not switch to a back-up car.

Live television coverage of the race began at 5:00 p.m. EDT in the United States on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a>. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were partly cloudy with an air temperature between and a track temperature which ranged between . <a href="William%20K.%20Thierfelder">William K. Thierfelder</a>, president of <a href="Belmont%20Abbey%20College">Belmont Abbey College</a> in <a href="Belmont%2C%20North%20Carolina">Belmont, North Carolina</a>, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Country and pop music singer <a href="LeAnn%20Rimes">LeAnn Rimes</a> performed the national anthem, and sponsored contest award winners commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, three drivers moved to the rear of the field because of unapproved changes; Boywer had switched to his back-up car, and <a href="David%20Ragan">David Ragan</a> and Harvick had changed their engines.

The race began at 5:52 p.m. Newman maintained his pole-position advantage heading into the first corner. After starting 21st, Jimmie Johnson moved to 15th position by lap eight. Kurt Busch passed teammate Newman for the lead three laps later. By the 20th lap, Kurt Busch, Newman, Earnhardt, Kenseth and Yeley were running in the top five positions. Earnhardt got ahead of Newman for second place four laps later. Hamlin moved to third position by lap 32. Hamlin made up a further position on lap 43 after he passed Earnhardt for second and was 1.2 seconds behind race leader Kurt Busch. The first <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">caution</a> of the race was shown four laps later when Biffle hit the turn two wall after his right-front tire had been cut and dropped debris on the track. Biffle's car sustained heavy damage to the right-hand side, ending his race. All drivers elected to make <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a>s for tires and fuel during the caution.

Kurt Busch, who made a 10.4-second pit stop for fuel and no tires, maintained the lead on the lap-52 <a href="Rolling%20start">restart</a> ahead of Hamlin, Kenseth, Earnhardt and Johnson. One lap later, a <a href="The%20Big%20One%20%28NASCAR%29">multi-car collision</a> occurred on the front stretch when <a href="A.%20J.%20Allmendinger">A. J. Allmendinger</a> lost control of his car in turn two and collided with the right-rear quarter panel of Johnson's car, which had a cut left-rear tire that burst after leaving turn four. Johnson's burst tire caused Blaney and Stewart to collide after Stewart slowed to avoid a collision with Johnson. Both drivers slid, collecting Gilliland, Sadler, <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20Montoya">Juan Pablo Montoya</a>, Green, Bowyer, Truex, Marlin, <a href="Johnny%20Sauter">Johnny Sauter</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Petty">Kyle Petty</a> and Harvick, all of whom had damage to their cars. The incident triggered the race's second caution. Johnson and Stewart made pit stops to repair the damage to their cars; both rejoined the race in eighteenth and twenty-fifth positions.

Kurt Busch led on the lap-62 restart, ahead of Hamlin, Kenseth, Earnhardt, and Gordon. The third caution was prompted on the same lap when <a href="Tony%20Raines">Tony Raines</a> lost control of his car and slid sideways into Jeff Gordon, and both drivers were sent into the infield grass. Jeff Gordon went back up towards the outside wall and was hit by Allmendinger at the start-finish line, resulting in the former going airborne; <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a> and Burton were also involved in the accident. Gordon was unhurt; drivers involved in the accidents, that caused the second and third cautions, made pit stops for repairs. Kurt Busch maintained his lead at the lap-70 restart, followed by Hamlin and Kenseth. Eight laps later, Burton caused the fourth caution after heavy contact with the turn three wall. During the caution, most of the leaders made pit stops; Newman stopped for a <a href="Panhard%20rod">track bar</a> adjustment and had a new <a href="Gear%20stick">shifter ball</a> installed. Kurt Busch and Kenseth chose not to pit and remained the leaders at the lap-83 restart, with Rudd in third place. Ten laps later, Newman, who was in eighth position, reported his car was "extremely tight" after the adjustments made at his pit stop. Stewart had moved back to eleventh and Johnson was thirteenth by lap 96. Kurt Busch's lead was four seconds over Kenseth after 100 laps, with <a href="Brian%20Vickers">Brian Vickers</a> following in third, Ragan fourth and Kyle Busch in fifth. Johnson passed Yeley for seventh position eleven laps later.

<a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">Green-flag</a> pit stops began on lap 112, with Kenseth pitting on the same lap for tires and a wedge change. Kurt Busch made his stop two laps later, handing the lead to Vickers for twelve laps. Kyle Busch took the lead on lap 126 with an advantage of ten seconds over Johnson by lap 131. Kyle Busch made his pit stop on the next lap, handing the lead to Johnson for one lap. Stewart took over the lead until his stop on lap 133, when Yeley became the race leader. Edwards and Elliott both held the lead in the next two laps. After the pit stops, Vickers regained the lead. On lap 140, Vickers' six-second lead was reduced to nothing when the fifth caution was triggered after debris was spotted on the backstretch. Most of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Mears was observed speeding, and was required by NASCAR to drop to the rear of the longest line.

Racing resumed on lap 146 with Vickers leading Kyle Busch, Earnhardt, Yeley and Stewart as daylight began to fade. Mears was afflicted with an <a href="Alternator%20%28automotive%29">alternator</a> issue on lap 149, and switched to a back-up <a href="Automotive%20battery">battery</a>. A <a href="flat%20tire">flat tire</a> slowed Earnhardt on lap 154; he pitted for new tires two laps later. Ragan moved back into the top five by lap 160. Ten laps later, debris was spotted in the turn two <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">groove</a>, causing the sixth caution, during which all of the race leaders made pit stops. Vickers led on the lap-173 restart, followed by Kurt Busch and Martin. Kurt Busch drove down to the track's inside and passed Vickers for the lead on lap 175; three laps later, Newman drove to his garage to retire with an engine failure. Mears' team installed a new battery into his car, and switched between his main and back-up battery to ensure engine power was maintained. Vickers retook the lead from Kurt Busch on the 181st lap, and Stewart got ahead of Kyle Busch one lap later. Johnson took the lead from Vickers on lap 185.

On lap 186, Kurt Busch nudged the turn two wall with his right-rear side and spun on the backstretch, triggering the seventh caution. He regained control of his car to run in ninth place. Most of the leaders made pit stops. Johnson led at the lap-190 restart, followed by Vickers and Kenseth. Johnson held a one-second lead over Vickers by the 200th lap, by which time Edwards moved past Stewart. Vickers retook the lead from Johnson on lap 206. Fifteen laps later, the eighth caution was triggered when Edwards's car suffered a cut right-rear tire, slowed on the track and spun at turn four while driving cautiously to the pit road. Edwards collected his teammate, Ragan, who was run into by Elliott. Mears was close by the incident but avoided damaging his car. On lap 222, Vickers reported a <a href="power%20steering">power steering</a> problem, and Kyle Busch was losing battery power. Most of the leaders, including Vickers, made pit stops. Kyle Busch's car had a replacement battery fitted and Vickers topped up with more fluids; both drivers rejoined in twelfth and thirteenth positions. Johnson led at the lap-227 restart, with Kenseth in second place. One lap later, Kenseth passed Johnson to take over first place, while Kyle Busch made heavy contact with the wall on his right side; a caution was not needed. Johnson reclaimed the first position from Kenseth on the backstretch on the 245th lap. Kyle Busch's right-front tire was cut, and went into the turn four wall on lap 252, triggering the ninth caution. During the caution, most of the leaders, including Johnson, chose to make pit stops. Johnson made changes to his car's left and right rear spring rubber, and Stewart's car's air pressure was adjusted.

Kyle Busch drove to his garage with a broken brake motor on the 254th lap and Mayfield led the field back up to speed for the restart on the 256th lap, ahead of Kenseth, Vickers, Stewart and Johnson. Mayfield dropped to third place as Kenseth and Vickers moved into first and second places on lap 257. Kenseth held a 2.2-second lead over Stewart, who moved to second and was closing on Kenseth by lap 265. The race's tenth caution was triggered two laps later when Kahne lost control of his car and hit the turn two outside wall. Most of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops. Johnson led the field on the lap-272 restart, followed by Kenseth and Stewart. Kenseth passed Johnson to reclaim the first position four laps later. Vickers and Rudd made contact while leaving the fourth turn on lap 281 but no caution was needed. Johnson retook the lead from Kenseth two laps later. Mayfield spun 360 degrees on the front stretch and went into the infield grass after trying to avoid a slower car on his outside on lap 291, causing the eleventh caution. The leaders, including Johnson, made pit stops for tires under caution. Rudd took over the lead for one lap before pitting on lap 293. Johnson regained the lead after the pit stops, maintaining it at the lap-297 restart; he was followed by Kenseth and Earnhardt. Kyle Busch rejoined the race on the same lap. Kurt Busch lost control of his car on the backstretch on lap 298; his car spun off and hit the inside wall, causing the twelfth caution. He drove to his garage to retire.

Johnson led the field back up to speed at the lap-301 restart. Kenseth retook the lead from Johnson on the 311th lap, and Johnson reclaimed the position one lap later. Stewart got ahead of Kenseth for second place on lap 314; he was six-tenths of a second behind race leader Johnson. After receiving a free pass from the tenth caution, Petty was running in ninth place by lap 316; he battled <a href="Reed%20Sorenson">Reed Sorenson</a> for eighth place. Fourteen laps later, Mears moved into third position. The thirteenth (and final) caution of the race was triggered on lap 337 when Vickers hit the turn two wall, damaging his car's right-hand side, sustaining a cut right-front tire and dropped debris onto the track. The leaders, including Johnson, made pit stops; Johnson's pit crew dropped a left-rear <a href="lug%20nut">lug nut</a>, costing him time while his mechanics searched for it, falling to tenth position. Stewart led the field on the lap-342 restart, ahead of Mears and Earnhardt. Johnson moved to fourth place by lap 367; three laps later, Stewart had a 1.1-second lead over Mears and extended it to 2.7 seconds by the 380th lap.

The second round of green-flag pit stops for fuel began on lap 381, as Earnhardt got past Mears for second place on the following lap. Mears lost third place to his teammate Johnson on lap 390. Johnson made his pit stop on the next lap and avoided a collision with Mears. Stewart drove slowly down the pit road on the 393rd lap because he was two laps short of fuel, allowing Earnhardt to move into first place before his own stop one lap later. Hamlin took over the lead before his pit stop on lap 395, allowing Mears to take over the first position. By lap 398, Mears held a ten-second lead over Yeley, who was closing the gap, and felt his car was tight when he drove to the track's outside, but held a strong line at the track's bottom when he moved out of traffic. Mears conserved fuel after slowing his pace following persuasion by his crew chief <a href="Darian%20Grubb">Darian Grubb</a>; he maintained his lead for the remaining two laps to win his first race in the Nextel Cup Series. He ran out of fuel on his cool-down lap; his engine cut out shortly after crossing the start-finish line. Yeley finished second, ahead of Petty in third, who secured his first top-five finish since the <a href="1997%20MBNA%20400">1997 MBNA 400</a>. Sorenson was fourth and Vickers came in fifth. Stewart, Rudd, Earnhardt, Hamlin and Johnson completed the top-ten finishers. The race had thirteen cautions and 29 lead changes among 15 drivers. Kurt Busch's total of 107 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Mears led for one period in the race, for a total of six laps.

Mears appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> to celebrate his first win in the Nextel Cup Series in front of the crowd; the win earned him US$377,425 and is his only career win as of 2019. Mears was delighted with his victory, saying in the post-race press conference, "This is unbelievable. I'm very, very excited about it and, at the same time, very relieved. I was afraid Darien [Grubb] was going to call me in. I'm glad he didn't. The only way we could win was to gamble and that's what we did." Mears said he had "a fourth place car at best". It was the first time since 1991 a person with the surname Mears had won in auto racing. Yeley, who finished second, said, "This is probably the first time in two years of Cup racing I didn't catch the bad break. I've always run into bad luck.", and, "At the end, we were a top-five car at best". Third-place finisher Petty said, "In all honesty, it's just a race. We didn't change the world tonight. It feels good to come back and race with these guys. I guess third place was just the cherry on the sundae." He also said he had a car that was capable of finishing in the top ten and that he would not have been able to run with the top drivers. Petty also praised Mears for his victory and said he felt Mears would have similar success in the future. Hamlin said he felt the top-five finishers were lucky to achieve their finishing positions and that his crew chief <a href="Mike%20Ford%20%28NASCAR%29">Mike Ford</a> said there was "no glory in winning a fuel-mileage race, other than saying you didn't run hard and were saving fuel".

Kurt Busch, who led 107 laps (more than any other driver) was frustrated after his lap-298 crash: "How in the world we can be so strong during the day here and almost in an instant go completely in the opposite direction is beyond my comprehension. We have to get a handle on it sooner or later. I'm frustrated and down right now, but we'll just keep plugging along looking for the answer." Newman, who led the first ten laps of the race, was happy despite retiring from the race: "We had a good car. We had just gotten the lucky dog and we were going to be one of the 15 cars on the lead lap. Everybody at Penske Racing has been doing a great job. We've just got to keep it up and stay focused." After finishing the race in fifth place (then the best finish for a Toyota car) Vickers said it was "rough" driving without the use of power steering that cut in and out but he felt <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing%20Team">Red Bull Racing Team</a> had "the best car" for the race. Stewart's crew chief <a href="Greg%20Zipadelli">Greg Zipadelli</a> was disappointed his driver could not take the victory: "If we hadn't had an opportunity to win, I'd say that finishing sixth and leading laps would be awesome, But sitting where we are right now, it seems that everything is stacked against us. We were probably a second- or third-place car at worst, so it's disappointing." Eighth-place finisher Earnhardt said he thought he secured a second-place finish and was unaware the leaders had made pit stops. Nevertheless, he said was happy with the way his team ran the race.

After retiring from the race on lap 221, Elliott blamed himself for the collision with Ragan, saying he waited too long to react and was heavily committed to driving down the racetrack. He was also unable to remove his foot from his brake pedal. Ragan said he felt he should have passed <a href="Roush%20Fenway%20Racing">Roush Fenway Racing</a> teammate Edwards, who spun up the racetrack. Edwards also said he was trying to avoid wrecking himself. According to Montoya, who was involved in the multi-car collision on the 53rd lap: "I saw a car flying, and as soon as I saw the car flying I checked up. We actually slowed down the car and everything. The ten car or somebody came right in behind us and just pushed us through the whole mess." Jeff Gordon said he was "fine" after the accident and that it "looked a lot worse than it really was ... Unfortunate because, man, what an awesome race car we had. I was so proud of <a href="Steve%20Letarte">Steve Letarte</a> and the guys. When we bring race cars like that to the track, it just makes me have a whole lot of fun. I was having a blast out there and I hate we are out of it. But I am ok." Allmendinger claimed responsibility for causing the crash and asked his <a href="Spotter%20%28auto%20racing%29">spotter</a> to apologize to Johnson's spotter, who relayed the message to Johnson via radio.

The result meant Jeff Gordon maintained his lead in the Drivers' Championship with 1,921 points, ahead of teammate Johnson with 1,789. Kenseth remained in third with his points advantage over Hamlin reduced to thirty-two. Burton remained in fifth place and Stewart remained in sixth. Harvick moved into seventh position while Edwards moved up two positions to eighth. Kurt Busch's non-finish meant he slipped to ninth and Bowyer was tenth. Kyle Busch and McMurray rounded out the top twelve. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet with 105 points extended its lead to forty-two points over its main rival Ford. Dodge increased its points advantage over Toyota in the battle for third place. The race took four hours, thirty-six minutes and twenty-seven seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 9.561 seconds.

SMS Wörth

SMS "Wörth" ("His Majesty's Ship Wörth") was one of four <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of the , built in the early 1890s. The class also included , , and . The ships were the first ocean-going battleships built for the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a> (Imperial Navy). "Wörth" was laid down at the <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in May 1890. The ship was launched on 6 August 1892 and commissioned into the fleet on 31 October 1893. "Wörth" and her three sisters carried six heavy guns rather than four, as was standard for most other navies' battleships. She was named for the <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%B6rth%20%281870%29">Battle of Wörth</a> fought during the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870–1871.

"Wörth" served in the German fleet for the first decade of her career, participating in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. She took part in the German naval expedition to China in 1900 to suppress the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>; by the time the fleet arrived the siege of Peking had already been lifted, and "Wörth" saw little direct action in China. She was placed in reserve in 1906 as newer, more powerful vessels had supplanted the "Brandenburg" class as front-line battleships. Obsolete by the start of World War I, "Wörth" and "Brandenburg" served in a limited capacity in the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> as coastal defense ships for the first two years of the war; they did not see action. By 1916, "Wörth" was reduced to a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>, a role in which she served until the end of hostilities. Despite plans to convert her into a freighter after the war, "Wörth" was scrapped in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> in 1919.

"Wörth" was the fourth of four s, the first <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of the "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a>, chief of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Alexander%20von%20Monts">Alexander von Monts</a> and instructed him to include four <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in the 1889–1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Tirpitz</a>-era <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the "<a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a>" (Young School).

"Wörth" was long, with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a draft of . She displaced as designed, and up to at full combat load. The ship was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple expansion steam engines</a> that produced and a top speed of on trials; steam was provided by twelve coal-fired, transverse cylindrical <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men.

The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of six heavy guns in three twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, rather than the four guns typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 inch) K L/40 guns, while the <a href="amidships">amidships</a> turret mounted a pair of 28 cm (11 inch) guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/35">SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>, also casemate mounted. "Wörth"s armament system was rounded out with six 45 cm <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. The main battery was heavier than that of other capital ships of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships.

The ship was protected with <a href="compound%20armor">compound armor</a>. Her main <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery barbettes were protected with thick armor.

"Wörth" was ordered as battleship "B", and was laid down at <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 3 March 1890. Initial work on the ship proceeded at the slowest pace of all four vessels in the class; her hull was not launched until 6 August 1892, more than eight months after the other three ships. <a href="Princess%20Viktoria%20of%20Prussia">Princess Viktoria</a>, the sister of <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, christened the ship. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and she was commissioned on 31 October 1893, the first ship of the class to enter active duty. Extensive <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s followed her commissioning and lasted until April 1894. During her trials, she was briefly assigned to the maneuver squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet) to replace her sister , which was damaged by a boiler pipe explosion. On 1 August 1894, "Wörth" was assigned as the flagship of the German fleet for the annual autumn maneuvers, under the command of Admiral <a href="Max%20von%20der%20Goltz">Max von der Goltz</a>. Goltz came aboard the new battleship on 19 August with his staff, which included then-"<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain at Sea) Alfred von Tirpitz. Toward the end of the maneuvers, which took place in both the <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>s, Kaiser Wilhelm II came aboard "Wörth" and reviewed a fleet parade on 21 September.

During this period, "Wörth" was commanded by <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a>, the younger brother of Wilhelm II; the senior watch officer aboard the ship in 1894 was <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>, who went on to command the German battlecruiser squadron during World War I and later the entire High Seas Fleet. On 1 November, Czar <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III</a> of Russia died; Wilhelm II initially planned to send his brother to <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> to represent Germany at the funeral aboard his flagship. But General <a href="Bernhard%20Franz%20Wilhelm%20von%20Werder">Bernhard Franz Wilhelm von Werder</a> suggested that sending a warship named for the <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%B6rth">Battle of Wörth</a> of the still-recent <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870–1871 would antagonize the French delegation and would be unwise, given the recently signed <a href="Franco-Russian%20Alliance">Franco-Russian Alliance</a>. Wilhelm II agreed, and so Prince Heinrich traveled to the funeral by train. After her sister entered service, she replaced "Wörth" as the fleet flagship. "Wörth" was thereafter assigned to the I Division of the I Squadron, in turn replacing the old <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a> .

"Wörth" and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> at Kiel on 3 December 1894. The squadron subsequently began a winter training cruise in the Baltic Sea; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet. In previous years, the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months. The I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a>. Further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs. From 19 December to 27 March 1895, "Wörth" returned to her old duty as fleet flagship while "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm" was in dock for repairs. The ship was occupied with individual and divisional training in early 1895. In May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic, concluding with a visit by the fleet to <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> in <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a> in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony.

On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise into the Atlantic; on the return voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> for the <a href="Cowes%20Regatta">Cowes Regatta</a>. While there on 6 August, Wilhelm II held a remembrance ceremony for the 25th anniversary of "Wörth"s namesake battle. This was sharply criticized in the British press. The fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the <a href="Helgoland%20Bight">Helgoland Bight</a> on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> capsized and sank in the storms—only three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a>. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> and in <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off <a href="Jaros%C5%82awiec%2C%20West%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship">Jershöft</a> concluded the maneuvers on 14 September.

The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted through April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included a visit to the Dutch ports of <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> and <a href="Nieuwediep">Nieuwediep</a>. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy <a href="Li%20Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. The following month, Czar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> visited the fleet in Kiel, boarding "Wörth" on 8 September. The ship won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron during 1896.

"Wörth" and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. The ship represented Germany during the <a href="Fleet%20Review">Fleet Review</a> for <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a>; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to <a href="Neufahrwasser">Neufahrwasser</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, but they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men.

The fleet followed the normal routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident. A voyage to the British Isles was also included. The fleet stopped in Queenstown, <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises. The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of <a href="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a> and a pitched battle with an "Eastern Fleet" in the Danzig Bay. While steaming back to Kiel, a severe storm hit the fleet, causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. In December, the I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a>, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited <a href="Kungsbacka">Kungsbacka</a>, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of the I Division went into dock for their winter repairs.

On 25 November 1899, "Wörth" was conducting gunnery training in Eckernförde Bay when she struck a rock. It tore a wide hole in the hull, flooding three of her <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s. The ship was sent to <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> for repair work. Before repairs could be begun, about of coal had to be unloaded to lighten the ship. Temporary steel plates were riveted to cover the hole on the starboard side, while the hull plates on the port side had to be re-riveted. The work lasted from December 1899 until February 1900; she was therefore unavailable for the normal winter cruise of the I Squadron.

During the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in <a href="Peking">Peking</a> and murdered Baron <a href="Clemens%20von%20Ketteler">Clemens von Ketteler</a>, the German minister. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a>, which consisted of the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s , , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral <a href="Edward%20Hobart%20Seymour">Edward Seymour</a>, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in <a href="Tianjin">Tientsin</a> due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition would include "Wörth" and her three sisters, six <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (General Field Marshal) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Waldersee">Alfred von Waldersee</a>.

On 7 July, "Konteradmiral" <a href="Richard%20von%20Gei%C3%9Fler">Richard von Geißler</a>, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a>, bound for China. They stopped to coal at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 17–18 July and passed through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> on 26–27 July. More coal was taken on at <a href="Perim">Perim</a> in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, and on 2 August the fleet entered the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. On 10 August, the ships reached <a href="Colombo%2C%20Ceylon">Colombo, Ceylon</a>, and on 14 August they passed through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>. They arrived in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> at <a href="Wusong">Wusong</a>, downriver from <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. From there, "Wörth" was detached to cover the disembarkation of the German expeditionary corps outside the <a href="Taku%20Forts">Taku Forts</a>.

By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. "Wörth" left Taku to coal at <a href="Tsingtau">Tsingtau</a>, the German naval base in China, and on 25 October returned to Wusong via <a href="Yantai">Yantai</a>. There, she joined the blockade of the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a>. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; "Wörth" went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, when she moved to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. "Wörth" and the rest of the fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May.

On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s forced the fleet to stop in <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20Seychelles">Mahé, Seychelles</a>, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in <a href="Colony%20of%20Aden">Aden</a> and <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>. On 1 August they reached <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the <a href="Generalinspekteur%20der%20Marine">Inspector General of the Navy</a>. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks.

Following her return from China, "Wörth" was taken into the drydocks at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul that lasted from 14 to 17 August. She then joined the fleet for autumn maneuvers. In the meantime, "Wörth" and her sisters, which had been assigned to the I Division before their expedition to China, had been transferred to the II Division of the I Squadron following their return. On 24 November, "Wörth" was decommissioned for a major reconstruction at the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Wilhelmshaven; she was the first member of her class to be modernized. During the modernization, a second <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was added in the aft superstructure, along with a <a href="wikt%3Agangway">gangway</a>. "Wörth" and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had their superstructure amidships reduced. The work lasted until December 1903.

After her modernization, "Wörth" returned to service on 27 September 1904 assigned to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Squadron</a>, where she replaced the old coastal defense ship . She served briefly as the flagship of "Konteradmiral" <a href="Alfred%20Breusing">Alfred Breusing</a> from September until December, when she was replaced in that role by . On 16 February 1905, "Wörth" ran aground in the <a href="Kieler%20F%C3%B6rde">Kieler Förde</a>. She was pulled free two days later after enough coal and ammunition were thrown overboard to lighten the ship. She then steamed into Kiel and entered drydock, where her bottom was found to be slightly dented. A second accident occurred on 5 July, when the torpedo boat ran across "Wörth"s bow. The battleship could not turn in time and rammed the torpedo boat, damaging it severely. One of "S 124"s boiler rooms flooded and the rush of steam from the boilers badly burned three men.

On 4 July 1906, "Wörth" was transferred to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm". She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a maintenance staff. Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, "Konteradmiral" <a href="Heinrich%20Sass">Heinrich Sass</a>. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> in Kiel to maintain her for future service.

On 5 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, "Wörth" was assigned to the <a href="V%20Battle%20Squadron">V Battle Squadron</a> under the command of "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Max%20von%20Grapow">Max von Grapow</a>. The squadron was initially used for coastal defense in the North Sea. From 19 to 26 September, "Wörth" and the rest of the V Squadron went on a sortie into the eastern Baltic but encountered no Russian forces. The ships subsequently returned to the North Sea and resumed their guard duties. "Wörth" was briefly transferred to the <a href="VI%20Battle%20Squadron">VI Battle Squadron</a> from 16 January to 25 February 1915 to strengthen the defenses of the Jade Bight and the mouth of the <a href="Weser">Weser</a>. On 5 March, she was moved to Kiel, where her crew was reduced. After a short period of rest, her crew was restored and she and "Brandenburg" were transferred to <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. She served as the flagship of "Konteradmiral" <a href="Alfred%20Begas">Alfred Begas</a>, the new commander of the V Squadron. In Libau, they were assigned as guard ships in the recently conquered Russian harbor.

The two old battleships were initially moored outside the harbor while it was cleared of wrecks. During this period, the ships prepared for an expected attack by the new Russian s, but the assault did not materialize. On 12 July, the crews of both ships were reduced again. On 15 January 1916, the V Squadron was disbanded and Begas removed his flag from "Wörth". She left Libau on 7 March and arrived in Neufahrwasser the following day. On 10 March she was decommissioned in Danzig to free her crew and guns for other uses. Some of her main battery guns were converted into <a href="28%20cm%20K%20L/40%20%26quot%3BKurf%C3%BCrst%26quot%3B">"Kurfürst"</a> railroad guns; they were ready for service by early 1918. "Wörth" herself was employed as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> in Danzig until the end of the war in November 1918. Both "Wörth" and "Brandenburg" were struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping. The two ships were purchased by "Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft"; "Wörth" was initially to be rebuilt into a freighter, but the planned reconstruction did not eventuate. Instead, "Wörth" was broken up for scrap in Danzig.

SMS "Brandenburg" was the lead ship of the <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, which included , , and , built for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) in the early 1890s. She was the first pre-dreadnought built for the German Navy; earlier, the navy had only built <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s and armored <a href="frigates">frigates</a>. The ship was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> dockyard in 1890, <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 21 September 1891, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the German Navy on 19 November 1893. "Brandenburg" and her three sisters were unique for their time in that they carried six heavy guns instead of the four that were standard in other navies. She was named after the <a href="Province%20of%20Brandenburg">Province of Brandenburg</a>.

"Brandenburg" served with the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Division</a> during the first decade of her service with the fleet. This period was generally limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, especially under the direction of <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s were deployed to China to suppress the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>. "Brandenburg" was scrapped in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, after the war, in 1920.

"Brandenburg" was the first <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> of the "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a>, chief of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Alexander%20von%20Monts">Alexander von Monts</a> and instructed him to include four <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s in the 1889–1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Tirpitz</a>-era <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the "<a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a>" (Young School).

"Brandenburg" and her sister ships—, , and —were long, with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of . The ship displaced as designed, and up to at full combat load. She was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple expansion steam engines</a> that produced and a top speed of on trials. Steam was provided by twelve transverse cylindrical <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men.

The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of six heavy guns in three twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, rather than the four guns typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 in) K L/40 guns, while the <a href="amidships">amidships</a> turret mounted a pair of 28 cm (11 in) guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/35">SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>, also casemate mounted. "Brandenburg"s armament system was rounded out with six 45 cm <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. Although the main battery was heavier than other capital ships of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships.

The ship was protected with <a href="compound%20armor">compound armor</a>. Her main <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were protected with thick armor.

Ordered as battleship "A", "Brandenburg" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> at <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a> in May 1890. Her hull was completed by September 1891 and <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 21 September, when she was christened by Wilhelm II. <a href="Fitting%20out">Fitting out</a> work followed and was finished, with the exception of the installation of her guns, by the end of September 1893, when she was transferred to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. There, her guns were mounted, and on 19 November "Brandenburg" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the fleet. <a href="Sea%20trials">Sea trials</a> began four days later; on the first day of trials, Wilhelm II and a delegation from the <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> provincial government came aboard the ship to observe. On 27 December, the ship received a flag bearing the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Brandenburg">coat of arms of Brandenburg</a>, which was flown on special occasions. At the end of the month, "Brandenburg" was formally assigned to the II Division of the Maneuver Squadron.

Trials continued into 1894, and while conducting <a href="forced%20draft">forced draft</a> tests in <a href="Strander%20Bucht">Strander Bucht</a> on 16 February 1894, the ship suffered the worst machinery accident in the history of the "Kaiserliche Marine". One of the main steam valves from the starboard boilers exploded, killing forty-four men in the boiler room and injuring another seven. The cause of the explosion was a defect in the construction of the valve. <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Henry</a>, aboard the nearby transport ship "Pelikan", immediately ordered the ship to come to "Brandenburg"s aid, and took off the dead and wounded men. "Brandenburg" then put into <a href="Wiker%20Bucht">Wiker Bucht</a>, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. The accident caused a minor political incident after the press criticized Wilhelm II for failing to send Prince Henry to the funerals for the sailors. Additionally, "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a>, the State Secretary of the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Naval%20Office">"Reichsmarineamt"</a> (Imperial Naval Office) stated before the "<a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a>" (Imperial Diet) that "such accidents could occur again and again", which increased parliamentary resistance to further increases in naval budgets; this led to an initial rejection of funds for the first <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>, . Admirals <a href="Eduard%20von%20Knorr">Eduard von Knorr</a> and <a href="Hans%20von%20Koester">Hans von Koester</a> criticized the comment, forcing Hollmann to publicly apologize.

Repair work was completed by 16 April, allowing "Brandenburg" to return to trials which lasted until the middle of August, and included a cruise through the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. On 21 August, the ship joined the II Division, though a reorganization of the fleet saw the ship transferred to the I Division, along with her three <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s. The I Division was based in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. "Brandenburg" and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> at Kiel on 3 December 1894. The squadron thereafter began a winter training cruise in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet. In previous years, the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months. During this voyage, the I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a>. King <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">Oscar II</a> held a reception for the visiting German delegation. Thereafter, further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs.

The year 1895 began with what became the normal training cruises to <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> and then to <a href="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a>, with Wilhelm II on board the <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm". This was followed by individual ship and divisional training, which was interrupted by a voyage to the northern North Sea, the first time that units of the main German fleet had left home waters. On this trip, "Brandenburg" joined "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm" and the two battleships stopped in <a href="Lerwick">Lerwick</a> in Shetland from 16 to 23 March. These exercises tested the ships in heavy weather; both vessels performed admirably. In May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic, and they were concluded by a visit of the fleet to <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> in Orkney. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were under way for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a> in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony. Further training exercises lasted until 1 July, when the I Division began a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. This operation had political motives; Germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels—the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> , the coastal defense ship , and the sailing <a href="frigate">frigate</a> —to an international naval demonstration off the Moroccan coast at the same time. The main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to Spanish waters. Rough weather again allowed "Brandenburg" and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent <a href="seakeeping">seakeeping</a>. The fleet departed <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> and stopped in <a href="Cobh">Queenstown</a>, Ireland. Wilhelm II, aboard his yacht <a href="SMY%20Hohenzollern">"Hohenzollern"</a>, attended the <a href="Cowes%20Regatta">Cowes Regatta</a> while the rest of the fleet stayed off the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>.
On 10 August, the fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers later that month. The first exercises began in the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a> on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a> capsized and sank in the storms—only three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming exercises, including live-fire exercises, in the Kattegat and the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a>. During this period, on 22 August, "Brandenburg" collided with the <a href="aviso">aviso</a> , though only the latter was damaged in the accident. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. The next day, while she was in Kiel, <a href="Czar">Czar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a> of Russia inspected "Brandenburg" during a visit to Germany. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> and in <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off <a href="Jaros%C5%82awiec%2C%20West%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship">Jershöft</a> concluded the maneuvers on 14 September. The rest of the year was spent on individual ship training. The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May, which included a visit to the Dutch ports of <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> and <a href="Nieuwediep">Nieuwediep</a>. Further maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters where the ships visited <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy <a href="Li%20Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training.

"Brandenburg" and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. Early in the year, the naval command considered deploying the I Division to another naval demonstration off Morocco to protest the murder of two German nationals there, but a smaller squadron of sailing frigates was sent instead. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and "<a href="Kaiserin">Kaiserin</a>" (Empress) Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> to accompany the Kaiser, who proceeded to the capital at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. They had returned to <a href="Neufahrwasser">Neufahrwasser</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt", "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new commander of the I Squadron, "Vizeadmiral" <a href="August%20von%20Thomsen">August von Thomsen</a>. These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery, especially at longer ranges, though the necessities of the <a href="line-ahead">line-ahead</a> formation led to a great deal of rigidity in the tactics. Thomsen's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven.

In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men. Additionally, while steaming through the Great Belt, "Brandenburg" collided with the ironclad , damaging both vessels and forcing them to put into Kiel for repairs. After temporary repairs to "Brandenburg" were completed, she moved to Wilhelmshaven, where a new <a href="naval%20ram">ram bow</a> had to be installed. The fleet followed the typical routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident, though a voyage to the British Isles was also included and the fleet stopped in Queenstown, <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises: the maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of <a href="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a> and a pitched battle with an "Eastern Fleet" in the Danzig Bay. While steaming back to Kiel, a severe storm hit the fleet, causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued the maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. In December, the I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a>, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited <a href="Kungsbacka">Kungsbacka</a>, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of the I Division went into dock for their winter repairs.

During a snow storm on 22 March 1899, the anchor chain for the ironclad broke, allowing the ship to drift out and <a href="Ship%20grounding">run aground</a> in Strander Bucht. "Brandenburg" and the shipyard steamer towed "Oldenburg" free and back to port. On 5 April, the ship participated in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Eckernf%C3%B6rde">Battle of Eckernförde</a> during the <a href="First%20Schleswig%20War">First Schleswig War</a>. In May, the I and II Divisions, along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic, went on a major cruise into the Atlantic. On the voyage out, the I Division stopped in <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and the II Division went into <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth</a> to restock their coal supplies. The I Division joined the II Division at Falmouth on 8 May, and the two units then departed for the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, arriving at <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> on 12 May. There, they met the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> of eight battleships and four armored cruisers. The German fleet departed for Germany, stopping again in Dover on 24 May. There, they participated in the <a href="Fleet%20review%20%28Commonwealth%20realms%29">naval review</a> celebrating <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s 80th birthday. The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May.

In July, the fleet conducted squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with soldiers from the <a href="X%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">X Corps</a>. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers. The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, which lasted until 7 September. After a third phase of the maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September, the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In the second half of March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in the Shetlands from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, the ships of the I Division were reassigned to the II Division.

During the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in <a href="Peking">Peking</a> and murdered Baron <a href="Clemens%20von%20Ketteler">Clemens von Ketteler</a>, the German <a href="plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a>. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a>, which consisted of the protected cruisers "Kaiserin Augusta", , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral <a href="Edward%20Hobart%20Seymour">Edward Seymour</a>, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in <a href="Tianjin">Tientsin</a> due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition included "Brandenburg" and her three sisters, six <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" (General Field Marshal) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Waldersee">Alfred von Waldersee</a>.

On 7 July, "Konteradmiral" <a href="Richard%20von%20Gei%C3%9Fler">Richard von Geißler</a>, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a>, bound for China. They stopped to coal at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 17–18 July and passed through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> on 26–27 July. More coal was taken on at <a href="Perim">Perim</a> in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, and on 2 August the fleet entered the Indian Ocean. On 10 August, the ships reached <a href="Colombo%2C%20Ceylon">Colombo, Ceylon</a>, and on 14 August they passed through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>. They arrived in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> at <a href="Wusong">Wusong</a>, downriver from <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>.

By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Nevertheless, "Brandenburg" took up patrol duties in the area surrounding the mouth of the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a>, and in October participated in the occupations of the <a href="coastal%20fortification">coastal fortification</a>s protecting the cities of <a href="Shanhaiguan%20District">Shanhaiguan</a> and <a href="Qinhuangdao">Qinhuangdao</a> before returning to the Yangtze. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; "Brandenburg" went to Hong Kong for her overhaul in January and February 1901. After the work was completed, she steamed to <a href="Tsingtao">Tsingtao</a> in the German <a href="Kiautschou%20Bay%20concession">Kiautschou Bay concession</a>, where she took part in training exercises with the rest of the expeditionary force.

On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s forced the fleet to stop in <a href="Mah%C3%A9%2C%20Seychelles">Mahé, Seychelles</a>, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in <a href="Colony%20of%20Aden">Aden</a> and <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>. On 1 August they reached <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral Koester, who was now the <a href="Generalinspekteur%20der%20Marine">Inspector General of the Navy</a>. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>.

Upon their return, "Brandenburg" and her sisters were assigned to the I Squadron. On 21 August, the annual fleet maneuvers began; these were interrupted on 11 September when Nicholas II visited the fleet while on another visit to Germany. The ships conducted a <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> for his visit in the <a href="Putziger%20Wiek">Putziger Wiek</a>. For the remainder of the maneuvers, the navy cooperated with the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> in joint exercises in <a href="West%20Prussia">West Prussia</a> that included the ships' "<a href="Seebataillon">Seebataillon</a>" (marines), and the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">I Corps</a> and the <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">XVII Corps</a>. Later in the year, "Brandenburg" took part in a winter cruise, followed by a period in the shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance. The year 1902 followed the routine pattern of individual, unit, and fleet training, along with a major cruise to Norway and Scotland, which concluded by passing through the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. After completing the fleet maneuvers in August and September, "Brandenburg" was decommissioned on 23 October. The ship's crew were sent to man the newly commissioned battleship , which took her place in the I Squadron.

In the early 1900s, the four "Brandenburg"s were taken into the drydocks at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven for major reconstruction. "Brandenburg" was modernized between 1903 and 1904. During the modernization, a second <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was added in the aft <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>, along with a <a href="wikt%3Agangway">gangway</a>. "Brandenburg" and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had the <a href="%3Awikt%3Ahamper%23Noun%202">hamper</a> amidships reduced. She was recommissioned on 4 April 1905 and was assigned to the II Squadron of what was now renamed the Active Battlefleet, though she remained in service only briefly. She participated in the normal routine of training exercises through 1905, 1906, and 1907, before being decommissioned again on 30 September 1907. During this period, the only noteworthy incident involving "Brandenburg" was a minor grounding outside <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> that did not inflict any damage on the ship. Upon her second decommissioning, her crew was again sent to staff a new battleship, this time . "Brandenburg" was thereafter assigned to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea.

By 1910, the first <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s began to enter service with the German fleet, rendering older vessels like "Brandenburg" obsolescent. That year, she temporarily returned to service with the III Squadron to take part in the annual fleet maneuvers. After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. "Brandenburg" again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Ostsee">Marinestation der Ostsee</a>", where she remained inactive for the following two years.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, "Brandenburg" was reactivated and assigned to the V Squadron, which was initially tasked with coastal defense duties in the North Sea. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Henry. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Brandenburg" and the rest of the squadron returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic. Prince Henry next ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December.

The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of the V Squadron ships. "Brandenburg" had her crew reduced in Kiel, and she was briefly assigned to the reserve division in the Baltic. From July to December, she underwent shipyard maintenance, before being transferred to <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. On 20 December, she was decommissioned there, for use as a water <a href="distillation">distillation</a> and <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>. Her heavy guns were removed for use in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, but there is no record of them ever having been shipped to the Ottomans. Near the end of the war, "Brandenburg" was taken back to Danzig, where work began to convert her into a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>, but the war ended before the reconstruction was completed. "Brandenburg" was struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping. The ship was purchased by "Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft", a shipbreaking firm headquartered in Berlin, and she was then <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> in Danzig.

23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian)

The 23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian) was a <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">mountain infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> of the "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>", the armed wing of the German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> that served alongside but was never formally part of the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> during World War II. It was composed of German officers and <a href="Bosniaks">Bosnian Muslim</a> soldiers. Named "Kama" after a small <a href="dagger">dagger</a> used by Balkan shepherds, it was one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the "Waffen"-SS during World War II. Formed on 19 June 1944, it was built around a <a href="En%20cadre">cadre</a> from the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a> but did not reach its full strength and never saw action as a formation.

Elements of the division fought briefly against <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> forces in southern Hungary in early October 1944 alongside the <a href="31st%20SS%20Volunteer%20Grenadier%20Division">31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division</a>. They were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun a move to the German <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a>, the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, to join the 13th SS Division when the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the "Kama" division mutinied on 17 October 1944. The cadre quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in the division being formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.

After the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> by the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> on 6 April 1941, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist <a href="Ante%20Paveli%C4%87">Ante Pavelić</a>, who had been in exile in <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>, was appointed "<a href="Poglavnik">Poglavnik</a>" (leader) of an <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>-led Croatian state – the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, all of modern-day <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and parts of modern-day <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> into an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate". NDH authorities, led by the <a href="Usta%C5%A1e%20Militia">Ustaše Militia</a>, immediately launched a campaign of mass killings, expulsions and forced religious conversions to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> targeting the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox</a> population living within the borders of the new state.

Despite Pavelić's assurances of equality with the predominantly Catholic Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Ustaše rule. An Islamic leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. By early 1942, fierce fighting had broken out between the Ustaše, <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a> and Partisans in NDH territory. Some Ustaše militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Ustaše violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the <a href="Croatian%20Home%20Guard%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Croatian Home Guard</a>, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as "of minimal combat value". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a>-based Home Guard "<a href="Had%C5%BEiefendi%C4%87%20Legion">Hadžiefendić Legion</a>" led by <a href="Muhamed%20Had%C5%BEiefendi%C4%87">Muhamed Hadžiefendić</a>, was of any significance.

The <a href="Bosniaks">Bosnian Muslims</a> sought protection and independence from the NDH, and saw German support as a means to achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg (<a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a>) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect their people and wrote to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because he did not want to create problems for Pavelić, "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> saw this as an opportunity to create a "Waffen-SS" recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims. In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-<a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> people, the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a>. The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH.

The Germans wanted to recruit a second SS division from the Muslims of Bosnia, as part of Himmler's goal to expand "Waffen-SS" recruiting in the Balkans. His plan was to form two <a href="corps">corps</a> of two divisions, with one corps to operate in the <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnian region</a> of the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the "<a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Volksdeutsche</a>" <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a> and together would form a Balkan SS mountain army of five divisions. On 28 May 1944, Hitler gave his formal approval for the creation of a 23rd SS Division, with its formation to begin on 10 June and training to be complete by the end of 1944. Himmler followed the advice of the commander of the 13th SS Division "Handschar", "<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">SS Brigadeführer and Generalmajor of Waffen-SS</a>" (Brigadier) <a href="Karl-Gustav%20Sauberzweig">Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig</a>, and agreed to form the division in the neighbouring <a href="Ba%C4%8Dka">Bácska</a> () region <a href="Hungarian%20occupation%20of%20Yugoslav%20territories">annexed by Hungary</a> instead of Bosnia. Sauberzweig believed that if the division was raised in the NDH, the Ustaše would undermine the morale of the recruits. The new division was named "Kama" after a small <a href="dagger">dagger</a> used by Balkan shepherds.

Orders were given to the 13th SS Division to provide a <a href="En%20cadre">cadre</a> for the new division, and "<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">SS Standartenführer</a>" (Colonel) <a href="Helmuth%20Raithel">Helmuth Raithel</a>, a regimental commander from the 13th SS Division, was appointed as the new division's commanding officer. The formation of the division was delayed by <a href="13th%20%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29%23Anti-Partisan%20operations%20June%20to%20August%201944">Operation "Vollmond"</a> to which the 13th SS Division was heavily committed, so formation did not begin until 19 June. On 21 June, Himmler promoted Sauberzweig to "<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS Gruppenführer and Generalleutnant of Waffen-SS</a>" (major general) and appointed him to command the Bosnian corps, which was given the title <a href="IX%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Corps%20of%20the%20SS%20%28Croatian%29">IX "Waffen" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian)</a>. The corps was to form at <a href="B%C3%A1csalm%C3%A1s">Bácsalmás</a> in southern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a>, where the <a href="18th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Horst%20Wessel">18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division "Horst Wessel"</a> was deployed.

Beginning on 23 June, 54 officers, 187 <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s (NCOs) and 1,137 enlisted men of the 13th SS Division that had been selected for transfer to the 23rd SS Division "Kama" were assembled in <a href="Bo%C5%A1njaci">Bošnjaci</a> in <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Posavina County</a> of the NDH, and they were moved into Bácska on 15 July. They included three NCOs from every company of the 13th SS Division, and one cavalry squadron, one battery from each of its artillery battalions, as well as specialist troops. German officers and NCOs were also provided by "Waffen-SS" replacement units. The divisional area lay along the <a href="Great%20Ba%C4%8Dka%20Canal">Franzen Canal</a>, with garrisons in <a href="Srbobran">Szenttamás</a> () and <a href="Kula%2C%20Serbia">Kúla</a> () and on either side of the line <a href="Sombor">Zombor</a>-<a href="Vrbas%2C%20Serbia">Verbász</a> (). The 10,000 men for a full-strength division were to be obtained from volunteers, from Muslim conscripts born in 1926 and 1927 (with some exceptions), and if necessary, from the various Muslim militias in the NDH. The conscripts were subjected to the draft by the NDH government then transferred to German command along with the others, who were then transported to "Waffen-SS" recruiting depots at Zombor and Bošnjaci. These men were to report by 15 September 1944, but in mid-August, "Waffen-SS" recruiting officer "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS Obergruppenführer</a>" (Lieutenant General) <a href="Gottlob%20Berger">Gottlob Berger</a> reported to Himmler that there would be insufficient reliable Muslim men available, and Catholic Croats would also have to be accepted into the 23rd SS Division. During Pavelić's visit to Hitler in September 1944, General <a href="%C4%90uro%20Gruji%C4%87">Đuro Grujić</a>, chief of Pavelić's Military Office, indicated to the Germans that it would be difficult to recruit another 5,000 men to complete the division after 5,000 had already been assigned. Many "Volksdeutsche" from the NDH and a few from Hungary were recruited into the division to act as interpreters between the Bosnian Muslims and the German cadre and to enhance unit cohesion.

On 10 September the division reached a strength of 126 officers, 374 non-commissioned officers and 3,293 men, composed of German officers and Bosnian Muslim soldiers, a fraction of its prescribed strength of 19,000 men. By this time, morale was waning within the new division just as it completed the final phase of its training in Hungary; the war was not going well, and there were rumours that the Germans were going to abandon the Balkans and leave the Muslims to defend themselves. Faced with high rates of desertion from the 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed a plan to disarm the Bosnians in both divisions, and on 18 September travelled to see Himmler. The "Reichsführer-SS" instead opted for a plan to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division to the area of operations of the 13th SS Division in Bosnia and re-organise both divisions there. <a href="Combat%20Arms">Combat arms</a> units from the 13th SS Division were to be brought under the direct control of IX "Waffen" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian), which would also move to Bosnia. Issued on 24 September, the plan cancelled the formation of the 23rd SS Division, and directed "<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">SS Oberführer</a>" (Senior Colonel) <a href="Gustav%20Lombard">Gustav Lombard</a> to form and command a new SS infantry division using the German cadre and equipment of the 23rd SS Division, supplemented by ethnic Germans recruited from Hungary. The Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division were to be transported by rail back to the <a href="Gradi%C5%A1te%2C%20Croatia">Gradište</a>-<a href="%C5%BDupanja">Županja</a>-Bošnjaci area for re-organisation into a "new" "Kama" division.

The staff of IX "Waffen" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) headquarters left Hungary, and on 3 October 1944 they arrived in the village of <a href="Andrija%C5%A1evci">Andrijaševci</a>, near <a href="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a>. The headquarters became partially operational on 7 October. The Bosnians did not leave Bácska immediately, and for a short period were garrisoned alongside Lombard's new <a href="31st%20SS%20Volunteer%20Grenadier%20Division">31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division</a>. In the meantime, the Red Army continued to advance into Hungary, and on 9 October 1944 a telegram was sent by the commander of "Waffen-SS" forces in Hungary to IX SS Mountain Corps in Bosnia announcing that "battle ready units from SS Oberführer Lombard's division and Bosnians from the Division "Kama" had been thrown into the fighting in Bacska". The Bosnian elements were deployed along the <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> () river for a week or so as part of "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a> Syr" in an attempt to slow the Soviet advance. As a result, the return of the Bosnians to the NDH was delayed.

The Bosnians were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun the move to Bosnia to join the 13th SS Division when they mutinied on 17 October 1944. Raithel quickly regained control, but the mutiny meant the re-organisation of a "new" 23rd SS Division was abandoned. A small number of reliable Bosnians from the division were used as replacements in the 13th SS Division, and the 23rd SS Division was formally dissolved on 31 October 1944. Despite its short existence, the 23rd SS is considered one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the "Waffen-SS" during World War II. After the division was disbanded, the numerical designator "23rd" was given to the <a href="23rd%20SS%20Volunteer%20Panzer%20Grenadier%20Division%20Nederland">23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division "Nederland"</a>, and Raithel went on to command the 11th SS-Gebirgsjäger Regiment ""<a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>"" of the <a href="6th%20SS%20Mountain%20Division%20Nord">6th SS Mountain Division "Nord"</a> against the United States Army in southern Germany during the final months of World War II.

The division's final order of battle consisted of:

The division also included a workshop company, veterinary company and administrative section.

The divisional insignia was a <a href="Vergina%20Sun">sun with 16 rays</a>, the ancient symbol of the Macedonian king <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region during the summer of 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 <a href="fez">fez</a>: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a <a href="swastika">swastika</a>. These non-standard uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.

Golden swallow

The golden swallow ("Tachycineta euchrysea") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> in the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family, Hirundinidae. Two subspecies are recognised, the <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>n "T. e. euchrysea" and "T. e. sclateri" of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> (<a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>). It usually inhabits the hills on the interior of islands, preferring open country. Currently, this swallow is restricted to isolated <a href="montane%20forest">montane forest</a>s that primarily consist of the <a href="Hispaniolan%20pine">Hispaniolan pine</a>. This species is considered to be a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), although the nominate subspecies, "T. e. euchrysea", is likely extinct. The exact cause of extinction is unknown, but likely factors include predation by mammals and <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>, although the habitat loss theory is not supported by very much evidence. The last sighting of the nominate subspecies was in <a href="Hardwar%20Gap">Hardwar Gap</a> (located on the boundary between <a href="Saint%20Andrew%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint Andrew</a> and <a href="Portland%20Parish">Portland</a> parishes), with three birds being seen on 8 June 1989.

A relatively small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze sides of the head. The ears and <a href="lores">lores</a> are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-<a href="coverts">coverts</a> are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irides</a> are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with its breast, and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts, being mottled grey-brown. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, "T. e. sclateri", is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.

In Hispaniola, this swallow breeds from April to July, where it lays a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> consisting of two to four white eggs. It formerly bred from June to July in Jamaica. The eggs are laid in a <a href="cup%20nest">cup nest</a> that is mainly found in Hispaniolan pine. It also nests in caves, under the eaves of houses, in burned stands, and in nest boxes. This swallow is an aerial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>, foraging for insects at heights that are usually under , and very rarely at heights over . When foraging, it is known to explore most habitats except forests.

The golden swallow was first described as "Hirundo euchrysea" by English naturalist <a href="Philip%20Henry%20Gosse">Henry Gosse</a>, in his 1847 book "The Birds of Jamaica", many years after European settlement of the island. Early naturalists were not aware of this species. The current genus "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>", on the other hand, was originally described in 1850 by the ornithologist <a href="Jean%20Cabanis">Jean Cabanis</a>. The binomial name is from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>. "Tachycineta" is from "takhukinetos", "moving quickly", and the specific "euchrysea" is from "eukhrusos", meaning "rich in gold". This is derived from "eu", meaning "plenty", and "khruseios", meaning "golden".

This species has two subspecies; the second, "Tachycineta euchrysea sclateri", was originally suspected of being distinct by <a href="Henry%20Bryant%20%28naturalist%29">Henry Bryant</a> in 1866, who recorded it as "var. "dominicensis"?" and noted differences in plumage from the nominate subspecies. However, his report lacked a <a href="species%20description">species description</a>. It was finally described as "Hirundo sclateri" in 1884 by American ornithologist <a href="Charles%20B.%20Cory">Charles Cory</a>, who felt it distinct enough to warrant separate species status. The subspecies name "sclateri" is dedicated to <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>, an English <a href="zoologist">zoologist</a>. The nominate subspecies, "T. e. euchrysea", is likely extinct.

This swallow, along with the <a href="violet-green%20swallow">violet-green swallow</a> and <a href="Bahama%20swallow">Bahama swallow</a>, comprise a <a href="clade">clade</a>. It is also considered to be of the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Tachycineta", the nominate subgenus, in addition to the violet-green swallow, Bahama swallow, and <a href="tree%20swallow">tree swallow</a>.

A small <a href="swallow">swallow</a>, the golden swallow measures, on average, . The adult of the nominate subspecies' upperparts, including the sides of the head, the cheek, and the chin, are an iridescent bronze. The ear coverts and lores are duller, and the forehead, crown, and nape are more green. This contrasts with the golden or coppery-bronze colouring of the mantle, shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts. The lesser and median-coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary wing-coverts being more green and dusky. The edges of the greater coverts and tertials are more golden. The primaries, secondaries, tail, axillaries, and underwing-coverts are dusky bronze-green, with the axillaries and underwing-coverts only having this colour on the edges. The tail is only slightly forked on the nominate subspecies, unlike the more deeply forked tail of the other subspecies, "sclateri". Its underparts are white, with dusky bronze streaks on the flanks. The legs and the feet are dark brown and the bill is black. Its <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irides</a> are also dark brown. The female is similar, although some of the underparts, specifically the breast and occasionally the throat and undertail-coverts, are mottled grey-brown. The mottling around the breast and collar is likely to decrease over time. The juvenile, like the female, is mottled grey-brown. The juvenile also has less glossy plumage and the sides of its head are a dusky grey.

The other subspecies, "sclateri", has slightly longer wings and a smaller bill. The plumage is less golden, with the forehead and uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and with both the wings and tail being blue-black. The underparts of "T. e. sclateri" also vary in being pure white without streaks.

This bird has a soft, two-note call, often described as a "tchee-weet", that is repeated.

The golden swallow is native to the islands of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, although the sole subspecies that resides in Jamaica, "Tachycineta euchrysea euchrysea", is likely extinct. It is found up to elevations of , from sea-level in Jamaica, and from in Hispaniola. It is likely that this species, when not breeding, moves down to lower altitudes. The estimated extent of occurrence for this swallow is . Primarily inhabiting hills of the interior of islands, this swallow prefers open country, but will occasionally be seen in forests and over towns. It is restricted to patches of <a href="montane%20forest">montane forest</a> that consists primarily of <a href="Pinus%20occidentalis">Hispaniolan pine</a>. Never common in Jamaica, it was restricted to mountainous limestone country in the island's interior.

The golden swallow usually builds its deep <a href="cup%20nest">cup nest</a> in dead snags, especially those of the Hispaniolan pine, in holes created by woodpeckers, primarily the <a href="Hispaniolan%20woodpecker">Hispaniolan woodpecker</a>. It also nests in caves, under the <a href="eaves">eaves</a> of houses, and in recently burned <a href="Grove%20%28nature%29">stand</a>s. The nests are made with fine <a href="vegetable%20fibre">vegetable fibre</a>s like silk, cotton, and pappus, with the seeds being broken off from the fibres. The nests are lined with cotton, silk, and feathers. One nest had a diameter of about , and a depth of about .

The breeding season occurs from June to July in Jamaica, and from April to July in Hispaniola. When breeding, the golden swallow usually nests in pairs and occasionally will nest in colonies. This swallow is not known to compete for nests with any other birds. The only species, an insect, that is known to inhabit nest boxes occupied by golden swallows is "<a href="Polyancistrus%20loripes">Polyancistrus loripes</a>", a species of <a href="katydid">katydid</a>. Only about 9.6% of nesting attempts are second nesting attempts, although this number may be low.

The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of this swallow is two to four white to creamy white eggs with little spotting. The eggs measure around , and weigh on average. They are generally laid one per day, although there are instances of the female skipping a day in laying. The incubation period ranges from 17 to 20 days, with the female incubating the young. The young usually fledge 24 to 27 days after they hatch.

This species is an aerial insectivore, usually feeding on <a href="flies">flies</a>, <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a> (or true bugs), and various other insects. It usually can be seen to forage low to the ground, either by itself or in small groups. It is not usually found to forage above , and very rarely above . <a href="Black%20swift">Black swift</a>s flying below are frequently found near golden swallows when the swallows are foraging. It is known to forage in most habitats except the forest. Generally, the golden swallow starts to forage at dawn, with activity increasing in the morning and decreasing during the afternoon.

The golden swallow is victim to various mammalian nest predators, including the introduced <a href="Indian%20mongoose">Indian mongoose</a>, feral cats, and multiple species of rats. These predators are thought to be linked to the extinction of the nominate subspecies. Nests on or near the ground in mines are especially vulnerable.

The golden swallow is considered to be a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>. This status is on account of the small, fragmented, and decreasing population and range. The nominate subspecies is presumed to be extinct, possibly because of habitat loss and predation. The remaining "T. e. sclateri" population is declining, mostly due to shifting agriculture and predation by introduced mammalian species. The population is estimated to be anywhere from 1,500 to 7,000 mature birds, in an area estimated to be .

This swallow is legally protected in Jamaica, although it is presumed to be extinct there. Not known to the early settlers on the island, it was considered to be common in the 1800s, but it declined and eventually became rare in the 1890s. In the last half of the 1900s, it was restricted to the area of <a href="Cockpit%20Country">Cockpit Country</a> east to the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Jamaica%29">Blue Mountains</a>. The last specimens collected were a pair from <a href="Portland%20Parish">Portland Parish</a> on 9 August 1908; the last confirmed sighting was in the Blue Mountains in 1950. It was regarded as rare from the 1960s to the 1980s, although its precarious status was not realised at the time. In 1987, the last major roosting site of this subspecies was destroyed. Birdwatchers in the Gosse Bird Club reported two probable sightings of several birds on Barbecue Bottom Road in <a href="Trelawny%20Parish">Trelawny Parish</a> in August and September 1982, while the last (and unconfirmed) report is of three birds at <a href="Hardwar%20Gap">Hardwar Gap</a> (located on the boundary between <a href="Saint%20Andrew%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint Andrew</a> and Portland parishes) on 8 June 1989.

Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> spent 18 years scouring the island for evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> but possibly also the Indian mongoose, is thought to be a factor. Graves points out that there is little evidence that habitat loss has played a role. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.

Flight feather

Flight feathers ("Pennae volatus") are the long, stiff, asymmetrically shaped, but symmetrically paired <a href="pennaceous%20feather">pennaceous feather</a>s on the <a href="wing">wing</a>s or tail of a bird; those on the wings are called remiges (), singular remex (), while those on the tail are called rectrices (), singular rectrix (). The primary function of the flight feathers is to aid in the generation of both <a href="thrust">thrust</a> and <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>, thereby enabling <a href="bird%20flight">flight</a>. The flight feathers of some birds have evolved to perform additional functions, generally associated with territorial displays, courtship rituals or feeding methods. In some species, these feathers have developed into long showy plumes used in visual courtship displays, while in others they create a sound during display flights. Tiny serrations on the leading edge of their remiges help <a href="owl">owl</a>s to fly silently (and therefore hunt more successfully), while the extra-stiff rectrices of <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s help them to brace against tree trunks as they hammer on them. Even flightless birds still retain flight feathers, though sometimes in radically modified forms.

The moult of their flight feathers can cause serious problems for birds, as it can impair their ability to fly. Different species have evolved different strategies for coping with this, ranging from dropping all their flight feathers at once (and thus becoming flightless for some relatively short period of time) to extending the moult over a period of several years.

Remiges (from the Latin for "oarsman") are located on the <a href="Posterior%20%28anatomy%29">posterior</a> side of the wing. <a href="Ligament">Ligament</a>s attach the long "calami" (quills) firmly to the wing bones, and a thick, strong band of <a href="tendon">tendinous</a> tissue known as the "postpatagium" helps to hold and support the remiges in place. Corresponding remiges on individual birds are <a href="symmetry">symmetrical</a> between the two wings, matching to a large extent in size and shape (except in the case of <a href="mutation">mutation</a> or damage), though not necessarily in pattern. They are given different names depending on their position along the wing. 

Primaries are connected to the <a href="manus%20%28zoology%29">manus</a> (the bird's "hand", composed of carpometacarpus and <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>); these are the longest and narrowest of the remiges (particularly those attached to the phalanges), and they can be individually rotated. These feathers are especially important for flapping flight, as they are the principal source of <a href="thrust">thrust</a>, moving the bird forward through the air. The mechanical properties of primaries are important in supporting flight. Most thrust is generated on the downstroke of flapping flight. However, on the upstroke (when the bird often draws its wing in close to its body), the primaries are separated and rotated, reducing air resistance while still helping to provide some thrust. The flexibility of the remiges on the wingtips of large soaring birds also allows for the spreading of those feathers, which helps to reduce the creation of wingtip <a href="vortex">vortices</a>, thereby reducing <a href="drag%20%28force%29">drag</a>. The barbules on these feathers, friction barbules, are specialized with large lobular barbicels that help grip and prevent slippage of overlying feathers and are present in most of the flying birds.
Species vary somewhat in the number of primaries they possess. The number in non-passerines generally varies between 9 and 11, but <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="stork">stork</a>s and <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>s have 12, and <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>es have 16. While most modern <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s have ten primaries, some have only nine. Those with nine are missing the most distal primary (sometimes called the remicle) which is typically very small and sometimes rudimentary in passerines.

The outermost primaries—those connected to the phalanges—are sometimes known as pinions.

Secondaries are connected to the <a href="ulna">ulna</a>. In some species, the ligaments that bind these remiges to the bone connect to small, rounded projections, known as <a href="quill%20knob">quill knob</a>s, on the ulna; in other species, no such knobs exist. Secondary feathers remain close together in flight (they cannot be individually separated like the primaries can) and help to provide lift by creating the airfoil shape of the bird's wing. Secondaries tend to be shorter and broader than primaries, with blunter ends (see illustration). They vary in number from 6 in <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a>s to as many as 40 in some species of <a href="albatross">albatross</a>. In general, larger and longer-winged species have a larger number of secondaries.
Birds in more than 40 non-passerine families seem to be missing the fifth secondary feather on each wing, a state known as diastataxis (those that do have the fifth secondary are said to eutaxic). In these birds, the fifth set of secondary <a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s does not cover any remiges, possibly due to a twisting of the feather papillae during <a href="embryo">embryo</a>nic development. <a href="Loon">Loon</a>s, grebes, <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="crane%20%28bird%29">crane</a>s, <a href="sandpiper">sandpiper</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, parrots, and owls are among the families missing this feather.

Tertials arise in the brachial region and are not considered true remiges as they are not supported by attachment to the corresponding bone, in this case the humerus. These elongated "true" tertials act as a protective cover for all or part of the folded primaries and secondaries, and do not qualify as flight feathers as such. However, many authorities use the term tertials to refer to the shorter, more symmetrical innermost secondaries of passerines (arising from the <a href="olecranon">olecranon</a> and performing the same function as true tertials) in an effort to distinguish them from other secondaries. The term <a href="humeral">humeral</a> is sometimes used for birds such as the albatrosses and pelicans that have a long humerus.

The calami of the flight feathers are protected by a layer of non-flight feathers called "covert" feathers or "<a href="covert%20feather">tectrices</a>" (singular "tectrix"), at least one layer of them both above and beneath the flight feathers of the wings as well as above and below the rectrices of the tail. These feathers may vary widely in size — in fact, the upper tail tectrices of the male <a href="peafowl">peafowl</a>, rather than its rectrices, are what constitute its elaborate and colorful "train".

The outermost primaries of large soaring birds, particularly raptors, often show a pronounced narrowing at some variable distance along the feather edges. These narrowings are called either notches or emarginations depending on the degree of their slope. An emargination is a gradual change, and can be found on either side of the feather. A notch is an abrupt change, and is only found on the wider trailing edge of the remige. (Both are visible on the primary in the photo showing the feathers; they can be found about halfway along both sides of the left hand feather—a shallow notch on the left, and a gradual emargination on the right.) The presence of notches and emarginations creates gaps at the wingtip; air is forced through these gaps, increasing the generation of lift.

Feathers on the <a href="alula">alula</a> or bastard wing are not generally considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers. However, alula feathers are definitely an aid to slow flight. These feathers—which are attached to the bird's "thumb" and normally lie flush against the <a href="anterior">anterior</a> edge of the wing—function in the same way as the <a href="Leading%20edge%20slats">slats</a> on an airplane wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal <a href="angle%20of%20attack">angle of attack</a> – and thus <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> – without resulting in a <a href="stall%20%28flight%29">stall</a>. By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing.

The development of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling <a href="hoatzin">hoatzin</a>s is much delayed compared to the development of these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with <a href="claw">claw</a>s on their first two <a href="finger">digits</a>. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though <a href="callus">callus</a>ed-over and unusable— into adulthood.

Rectrices (from the Latin for "helmsman"), which help the bird to brake and steer in flight, lie in a single horizontal row on the rear margin of the anatomic tail. Only the central pair are attached (via <a href="ligament">ligament</a>s) to the tail bones; the remaining rectrices are embedded into the <a href="rectricial%20bulbs">rectricial bulbs</a>, complex structures of fat and muscle that surround those bones. Rectrices are always paired, with a vast majority of species having six pairs. They are absent in grebes and some <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s, and greatly reduced in size in penguins. Many <a href="grouse">grouse</a> species have more than 12 rectrices. Some species (including <a href="ruffed%20grouse">ruffed grouse</a>, <a href="hazel%20grouse">hazel grouse</a> and <a href="common%20snipe">common snipe</a>) have a number that varies among individuals. <a href="Domestic%20pigeon">Domestic pigeon</a>s have a highly variable number, due to centuries of selective breeding.

In order to make the discussion of such topics as <a href="moult">moult</a> processes or <a href="animal">body</a> structure easier, <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a>s assign a number to each flight feather. By convention, the numbers assigned to primary feathers always start with the letter P "(P1, P2, P3, etc.)", those of secondaries with the letter S, those of tertials with T and those of rectrices with R.

Most authorities number the primaries descendantly, starting from the innermost primary (the one closest to the secondaries) and working outwards; others number them ascendantly, from the most distal primary inwards. There are some advantages to each method. Descendant numbering follows the normal sequence of most birds' primary moult. In the event that a species is missing the small distal 10th primary, as some passerines are, its lack does not impact the numbering of the remaining primaries. Ascendant numbering, on the other hand, allows for uniformity in the numbering of non-passerine primaries, as they almost invariably have four attached to the manus regardless of how many primaries they have overall. This method is particularly useful for indicating wing formulae, as the outermost primary is the one with which the measurements begin.

Secondaries are always numbered ascendantly, starting with the outermost secondary (the one closest to the primaries) and working inwards. Tertials are also numbered ascendantly, but in this case, the numbers continue on consecutively from that given to the last secondary (e.g. ... S5, S6, T7, T8, ... etc.).

Rectrices are always numbered from the centermost pair outwards in both directions.

The flight feathers of some species have undergone evolutionary changes which allow them to provide additional functionality.

In some species, for example, either remiges or rectrices make a sound during flight. These sounds are most often associated with courtship or territorial displays. The outer primaries of male <a href="broad-tailed%20hummingbird">broad-tailed hummingbird</a>s produce a distinctive high-pitched trill, both in direct flight and in power-dives during courtship displays; this trill is diminished when the outer primaries are worn, and absent when those feathers have been moulted. During the <a href="northern%20lapwing">northern lapwing</a>'s zigzagging display flight, the bird's outer primaries produce a humming sound. The outer primaries of the male <a href="American%20woodcock">American woodcock</a> are shorter and slightly narrower than those of the female, and are likely the source of the whistling and twittering sounds made during his courtship display flights. Male <a href="club-winged%20manakin">club-winged manakin</a>s use modified secondaries to make a clear trilling courtship call. A curve-tipped secondary on each wing is dragged against an adjacent ridged secondary at high speeds (as many as 110 times per second—slightly faster than a hummingbird's wingbeat) to create a <a href="stridulation">stridulation</a> much like that produced by some insects. Both <a href="Wilson%27s%20snipe">Wilson's</a> and <a href="common%20snipe">common snipe</a> have modified outer tail feathers which make noise when they are spread during the birds' roller coaster display flights; as the bird dives, wind flows through the modified feathers and creates a series of rising and falling notes, which is known as "winnowing". Differences between the sounds produced by these two former conspecific subspecies—and the fact that the outer two pairs of rectrices in Wilson's snipe are modified, while only the single outermost pair are modified in common snipe—were among the characteristics used to justify their splitting into two distinct and separate species.
Flight feathers are also used by some species in visual displays. Male <a href="standard-winged%20nightjar">standard-winged</a> and <a href="pennant-winged%20nightjar">pennant-winged nightjar</a>s have modified P2 primaries (using the descendant numbering scheme explained above) which are displayed during their courtship rituals. In the standard-winged nightjar, this modified primary consists of an extremely long shaft with a small "pennant" (actually a large web of barbules) at the tip. In the pennant-winged nightjar, the P2 primary is an extremely long (but otherwise normal) feather, while P3, P4 and P5 are successively shorter; the overall effect is a broadly forked wingtip with a very long plume beyond the lower half of the fork.

Males of many species, ranging from the widely introduced <a href="ring-necked%20pheasant">ring-necked pheasant</a> to Africa's many <a href="indigobird">whydahs</a>, have one or more elongated pairs of rectrices, which play an often-critical role in their courtship rituals. The outermost pair of rectrices in male <a href="lyrebird">lyrebird</a>s are extremely long and strongly curved at the ends. These plumes are raised up over the bird's head (along with a fine spray of modified uppertail coverts) during his extraordinary display. Rectrix modification reaches its pinnacle among the <a href="bird-of-paradise">birds of paradise</a>, which display an assortment of often bizarrely modified feathers, ranging from the extremely long plumes of the <a href="ribbon-tailed%20astrapia">ribbon-tailed astrapia</a> (nearly three times the length of the bird itself) to the dramatically coiled twin plumes of the <a href="magnificent%20bird-of-paradise">magnificent bird-of-paradise</a>.

<a href="Owl">Owl</a>s have remiges which are serrated rather than smooth on the leading edge. This adaptation disrupts the flow of air over the wings, eliminating the noise that airflow over a smooth surface normally creates, and allowing the birds to fly and hunt silently.

The rectrices of <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s are proportionately short and very stiff, allowing them to better brace themselves against tree trunks while feeding. This adaptation is also found, though to a lesser extent, in some other species that feed along tree trunks, including <a href="woodcreeper">woodcreeper</a>s and <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s.

Scientists have not yet determined the function of all flight feather modifications. Male swallows in the genera "Psalidoprocne" and "Stelgidopteryx" have tiny recurved hooks on the leading edges of their outer primaries, but the function of these hooks is not yet known; some authorities suggest they may produce a sound during territorial or courtship displays.

Over time, a small number of bird species have lost their ability to fly. Some of these, such as the <a href="Tachyeres">steamer ducks</a>, show no appreciable changes in their flight feathers. Some, such as the <a href="Titicaca%20grebe">Titicaca grebe</a> and a number of the flightless rails, have a reduced number of primaries.

The remiges of ratites are soft and downy; they lack the interlocking hooks and barbules that help to stiffen the flight feathers of other birds. In addition, the <a href="emu">emu</a>'s remiges are proportionately much reduced in size, while those of the <a href="cassowary">cassowaries</a> are reduced both in number and structure, consisting merely of 5–6 bare quills. Most ratites have completely lost their rectrices; only the ostrich still has them.

Penguins have lost their differentiated flight feathers. As adults, their wings and tail are covered with the same small, stiff, slightly curved feathers as are found on the rest of their bodies.

The ground-dwelling <a href="kakapo">kakapo</a>, which is the world's only flightless parrot, has remiges which are shorter, rounder and more symmetrically vaned than those of parrots capable of flight; these flight feathers also contain fewer interlocking barbules near their tips.

Once they have finished growing, feathers are essentially dead structures. Over time, they become worn and abraded, and need to be replaced. This replacement process is known as <a href="moult">moult</a> (molt in the United States). The loss of wing and tail feathers can affect a bird's ability to fly (sometimes dramatically) and in certain <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a> can impair the ability to feed or perform <a href="Courtship%23Courtship%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom">courtship</a> displays. The timing and progression of flight feather moult therefore varies among families.

For most birds, moult begins at a certain specific point, called a focus (plural foci), on the wing or tail and proceeds in a sequential manner in one or both directions from there. For example, most passerines have a focus between the innermost primary (P1, using the numbering scheme explained above) and outermost secondary (S1), and a focus point in the middle of the center pair of rectrices. As passerine moult begins, the two feathers closest to the focus are the first to drop. When replacement feathers reach roughly half of their eventual length, the next feathers in line (P2 and S2 on the wing, and both R2s on the tail) are dropped. This pattern of drop and replacement continues until moult reaches either end of the wing or tail. The speed of the moult can vary somewhat within a species. Some passerines that breed in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>, for example, drop many more flight feathers at once (sometimes becoming briefly flightless) in order to complete their entire wing moult prior to <a href="Bird%20migration">migrating</a> south, while those same species breeding at lower <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s undergo a more protracted moult.

In many species, there is more than one focus along the wing. Here, moult begins at all foci simultaneously, but generally proceeds only in one direction. Most grouse, for example, have two wing foci: one at the wingtip, the other between feathers P1 and S1. In this case, moult proceeds descendantly from both foci. Many large, long-winged birds have multiple wing foci.

Birds that are heavily "wing-loaded"—that is, heavy-bodied birds with relatively short wings—have great difficulty flying with the loss of even a few flight feathers. A protracted moult like the one described above would leave them vulnerable to <a href="predator">predator</a>s for a sizeable portion of the year. Instead, these birds lose all their flight feathers at once. This leaves them completely flightless for a period of three to four weeks, but means their overall period of vulnerability is significantly shorter than it would otherwise be. Eleven families of birds, including <a href="loon">loon</a>s, grebes and most <a href="Anseriformes">waterfowl</a>, have this moult strategy.

The cuckoos show what is called saltatory or transilient wing moults. In simple forms, this involves the moulting and replacement of odd-numbered primaries and then the even-numbered primaries. There are however complex variations with differences based on life history.

Arboreal <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, which depend on their tails—particularly the strong central pair of rectrices—for support while they feed, have a unique tail moult. Rather than moulting their central tail feathers first, as most birds do, they retain these feathers until last. Instead, the second pair of rectrices (both R2 feathers) are the first to drop. (In some species in the genera "Celeus" and "Dendropicos", the third pair is the first dropped.) The pattern of feather drop and replacement proceeds as described for passerines (above) until all other rectrices have been replaced; only then are the central tail rectrices moulted. This provides some protection to the growing feathers, since they're always covered by at least one existing feather, and also ensures that the bird's newly strengthened tail is best able to cope with the loss of the crucial central rectrices. Ground-feeding woodpeckers, such as the <a href="wryneck">wryneck</a>s, do not have this modified moult strategy; in fact, wrynecks moult their outer tail feathers first, with moult proceeding <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximal</a>ly from there.

There are often substantial differences between the remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted over a longer period of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.

As feathers grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible dark and light bands in the fully formed feather. These "growth bars" and their widths have been used to determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called "ptilochronology" (analogous to <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>).

In general, juveniles have feathers which are narrower and more sharply pointed at the tip. This can be particularly visible when the bird is in flight, especially in the case of raptors. The trailing edge of the wing of a juvenile bird can appear almost serrated, due to the feathers' sharp tips, while that of an older bird will be straighter-edged. The flight feathers of a juvenile bird will also be uniform in length, since they all grew at the same time. Those of adults will be of various lengths and levels of wear, since each is moulted at a different time.

The flight feathers of adults and juveniles can differ considerably in length, particularly among the raptors. Juveniles tend to have slightly longer rectrices and shorter, broader wings (with shorter outer primaries, and longer inner primaries and secondaries) than do adults of the same species. However, there are many exceptions. In longer-tailed species, such as <a href="swallow-tailed%20kite">swallow-tailed kite</a>, <a href="secretary%20bird">secretary bird</a> and <a href="European%20honey%20buzzard">European honey buzzard</a>, for example, juveniles have shorter rectrices than adults do. Juveniles of some "Buteo" buzzards have narrower wings than adults do, while those of large juvenile falcons are longer. It is theorized that the differences help young birds compensate for their inexperience, weaker flight muscles and poorer flying ability.

A wing formula describes the shape of distal end of a bird's wing in a <a href="mathematical">mathematical</a> way. It can be used to help distinguish between species with similar plumages, and thus is particularly useful for those who <a href="bird%20ringing">ring (band)</a> birds.

To determine a bird's wing formula, the distance between the tip of the most distal primary and the tip of its greater covert (the longest of the feathers that cover and protect the shaft of that primary) is measured in millimeters. In some cases, this results in a positive number (e.g., the primary extends beyond its greater covert), while in other cases it is a negative number (e.g. the primary is completely covered by the greater covert, as happens in some passerine species). Next, the longest primary feather is identified, and the differences between the length of that primary and that of all remaining primaries and of the longest secondary are also measured, again in millimeters. If any primary shows a notch or emargination, this is noted, and the distance between the feather's tip and any notch is measured, as is the depth of the notch. All distance measurements are made with the bird's wing closed, so as to maintain the relative positions of the feathers.

While there can be considerable variation across members of a species—and while the results are obviously impacted by the effects of moult and feather regeneration—even very closely related species show clear differences in their wing formulas.

The distance that a bird's longest primaries extend beyond its longest secondaries (or tertials) when its wings are folded is referred to as the primary extension or primary projection. As with wing formulae, this measurement is useful for distinguishing between similarly plumaged birds; however, unlike wing formulae, it is not necessary to have the bird in-hand to make the measurement. Rather, this is a useful "relative" measurement—some species have long primary extensions, while others have shorter ones. Among the "<a href="Empidonax">Empidonax</a>" <a href="Tyrant%20flycatcher">flycatchers</a> of the Americas, for example, the <a href="American%20dusky%20flycatcher">dusky flycatcher</a> has a much shorter primary extension than does the very similarly plumaged <a href="Hammond%27s%20flycatcher">Hammond's flycatcher</a>. Europe's <a href="common%20skylark">common skylark</a> has a long primary projection, while that of the near-lookalike <a href="Oriental%20skylark">Oriental skylark</a> is very short.

As a general rule, species which are long distance migrants will have longer primary projection than similar species which do not migrate or migrate shorter distances.

22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry

The 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an <a href="Infantry%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">infantry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> army during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The 22nd Massachusetts was organized by <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a> (future <a href="Vice-President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice-President</a> during the <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a> administration) and was therefore known as "Henry Wilson's Regiment." It was formed in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, and established on September 28, 1861, for a term of three years.

Arriving in Washington in October 1861, the regiment spent the following winter in camp at Hall's Hill, near <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. It became part of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, with which it would be associated for its entire term of service. The regiment saw its first action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Yorktown%20%281862%29">Siege of Yorktown</a> in April 1862. It was involved in the <a href="Peninsular%20Campaign">Peninsular Campaign</a>, particularly the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaines%27%20Mill">Battle of Gaines' Mill</a> during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> (60 percent). The 22nd Massachusetts was present for virtually all of the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought, including the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, the Battle of Gettysburg and <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a>'s <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a>. The 22nd was especially proficient in <a href="skirmisher">skirmish drill</a> and was frequently deployed in that capacity throughout the war.

During the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a> in October 1864, the 22nd Massachusetts was removed from the lines and sent home to Massachusetts. Of the 1,100 who initially belonged to the unit, only 125 returned at the end of their three years of service. Of these losses, roughly 300 were killed in action or died from wounds received in action, approximately 500 were discharged due to wounds or disease, and approximately 175 were lost or discharged due to capture, resignation, or desertion.

Henry Wilson, a Senator from <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and chairman of the Senate's <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Military%20Affairs">Committee on Military Affairs</a>, witnessed the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> on July 21, 1861. The disastrous defeat of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> army convinced Wilson, and the federal government in general, of the urgent need for more troops. Immediately after the battle, Wilson promised both President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and Massachusetts Governor <a href="John%20Albion%20Andrew">John Andrew</a> that he would raise a full <a href="brigade">brigade</a> including units of <a href="Infantry%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">infantry</a>, <a href="Field%20artillery%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">artillery</a>, <a href="Cavalry%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">cavalry</a> and sharpshooters.

Wilson's prestige encouraged the almost immediate formation of more than a dozen <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> of infantry in and around <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. The pressing need to send troops to the front required Wilson to abandon his original intention of raising multiple regiments of infantry and he instead selected the 10 companies closest to readiness, thus creating the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment. To this regiment were attached the <a href="3rd%20Massachusetts%20Light%20Artillery">3rd Massachusetts Light Artillery</a> and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters. Thus, the 22nd Massachusetts became one of the few infantry units in the Civil War with attached artillery and sharpshooters.

Many of the officers of the 22nd, and some of the enlisted men, had just completed an enlistment with early war regiments (the so-called "ninety day regiments"), including the <a href="5th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Militia">5th Massachusetts</a> and the <a href="6th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Militia">6th Massachusetts</a>. Five of the 10 companies were recruited in Boston. The remaining five came from <a href="Taunton%2C%20Massachusetts">Taunton</a>, <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Massachusetts">Roxbury</a>, <a href="Woburn%2C%20Massachusetts">Woburn</a>, <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a> and <a href="Haverhill%2C%20Massachusetts">Haverhill</a>.

The regiment was signed into existence by Gov. Andrew on September 28, 1861. Wilson was appointed its first colonel. The recruits of the 22nd Massachusetts trained at a camp in <a href="Lynnfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Lynnfield, Massachusetts</a>, during September and left for the front, numbering 1,117, on October 8, 1861. Traveling by railroad, the regiment paused in New York City, marching down <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, and was received with a formal ceremony and the presentation of a national battle flag made by a committee of the ladies of New York.

The 22nd arrived in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> on October 11, and on October 13, marched across the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac</a> to go into winter camp at Halls Hill, just outside <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>. Here the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> was organized during the winter of 1861–1862. The 22nd became part of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="John%20H.%20Martindale">John H. Martindale</a>'s brigade and was initially attached to the <a href="III%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">III Corps</a>.

On October 28, 1861, <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Col.</a> Wilson resigned his command, turning the regiment over to Col. <a href="Jesse%20Gove">Jesse Gove</a>. Gove, a <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Regular Army</a> officer, had seen service in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. He was a strict disciplinarian and, according to John Parker (the regimental historian) Gove soon became the "idol of the regiment". During its first winter of service, the 22nd remained at Hall's Hill and became proficient in military drill.

<a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>, commanding the Army of the Potomac, determined to take the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> capital of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> via the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">Virginia Peninsula</a>. This unexpected move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army of the Potomac was gradually transferred by water to <a href="Fortress%20Monroe">Fortress Monroe</a> at the end of the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many other elements of the Army of the Potomac, up the peninsula.

As Union forces approached <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown, Virginia</a> they encountered defensive lines established by Confederate <a href="Major%20General%20%28CSA%29">Major General</a> <a href="John%20B.%20Magruder">John B. Magruder</a>. Initially, Magruder's forces numbered only 11,000 with McClellan's numbering 53,000. McClellan also had the rest of the Army of the Potomac "en route" and Union troops outside of Yorktown would soon number more than 100,000. Despite this, McClellan believed he faced a much larger force and settled in for a month-long siege of Yorktown.

The 22nd Massachusetts saw their first action of the war near Yorktown on April 5, 1862, as the regiment was ordered to probe the Confederate lines. During the action, a portion of the regiment deployed as <a href="skirmishers">skirmishers</a> under fire with great precision. The 22nd's reputation for expertise at skirmish drill would continue throughout the war and the regiment would frequently be used in this capacity. Over the course of the month-long siege, the 22nd was encamped near Wormley Creek approximately southeast of Yorktown, frequently forming up at a moment's notice in expectation of an attack. On May 4, the Confederates evacuated their lines, retreating towards Richmond. The 22nd was on picket duty when rumors of the evacuation began to circulate. Colonel Gove determined to investigate and advanced the 22nd towards the Confederate trenches. According to the regimental historian, Gove was the first Union soldier to mount the Confederate works and the 22nd's flag was the first planted on the ramparts outside of Yorktown.

Over the next three weeks, McClellan pushed his army northwest up the Peninsula towards Richmond. The 22nd traveled by steamship and by foot, eventually reaching Gaines' Mill, Virginia where they set up camp on May 26, 1862, about northeast of Richmond. During this movement, the <a href="V%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">V Corps</a> of the Union army was formed and the 22nd became part of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps. The regiment would remain a part of the V Corps for the duration of their service.

After seeing minor action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hanover%20Court%20House">Battle of Hanover Court House</a> on May 27, the 22nd remained in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond. The men of the 22nd could see the steeples of Richmond from their camp. By this time, the regiment had been reduced to roughly 750 men due to sickness over the course of the campaign and minor casualties in action.

On June 25, 1862, McClellan ordered an ineffective offensive triggering the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a>. On June 26, <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">General</a> <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, who had recently taken command of the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, launched a daring counter-offensive intended to drive McClellan's army away from Richmond. For the 22nd, the third day of the Seven Days Battles, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaines%27%20Mill">Battle of Gaines' Mill</a>, proved to be devastating as they suffered their worst casualties of the war.

The regimental historian wrote, "It was a sad night for the Twenty-second. Not a man but had lost a comrade, for one-half of those who marched in the morning were no longer in the ranks. Colonel Gove was killed and that was, without a doubt, one of the greatest disasters of the day." The 22nd Massachusetts and the 83rd Pennsylvania suffered roughly the same casualty rate and the two regiments lost more men killed in action than any other units on the field that day. Both regiments lost their colonels.

The 22nd played little role in the next three days of fighting, with the exception of brief action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Glendale">Battle of Glendale</a> during which the regiment supported the 3rd Massachusetts Battery and was credited with saving the battery from capture. By June 30, the regiment was encamped near Malvern Hill with the rest of the V Corps. The Army of the Potomac had retreated roughly during a running fight over the past six days and was suffering low morale. However, by July 1, the Union army was in a strong position and, that day, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Malvern%20Hill">Battle of Malvern Hill</a>, the Army of the Potomac finally stopped Lee's offensive. The 22nd, during this action, was ordered to support the 5th United States Battery. While firing in line with the battery, the men of the 22nd sang "<a href="John%20Brown%27s%20Body">John Brown's Body</a>" and exhausted their 60 rounds of ammunition. After they were pulled off the line, the 22nd marched through the night to <a href="Harrison%27s%20Landing">Harrison's Landing</a>. The regiment lost nine killed, 41 wounded and eight prisoners during the Battle of Malvern Hill, roughly 20 percent.

On July 15, 1862, while the 22nd was still in camp at Harrison's Landing, Lieutenant Colonel Griswold returned from sick leave, was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment. On August 14, the regiment broke camp and marched with the V Corps to <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>. McClellan had abandoned his Peninsular Campaign and had been ordered to move the Army of the Potomac back to Northern Virginia to support the advance of a newly organized Union army, the <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>, under the command of Major General <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>. The 22nd was transported by steamship to Aquia Creek, Virginia, by railroad to <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg</a>, and by August 28 they had marched with the V Corps to <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Virginia">Gainesville, Virginia</a>. In the course of this march, the 22nd was detached from their brigade and assigned to <a href="picket%20%28military%29">picket</a> duty. As a result, the regiment played no role in the subsequent <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a> on August 30, 1862, in which the rest of their brigade was heavily engaged.

Following the disastrous defeat of Pope's army at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Army of the Potomac, with McClellan still in command, was quickly reorganized outside of Washington during the first week of September 1862. The 22nd returned to their old camp at Halls Hill, Virginia, which they had occupied the previous winter. Sen. Wilson visited the 22nd at Halls Hill. Finding just 200 war-torn men in contrast to the 1,100 he had recruited, Wilson, with tears in his eyes, asked, "Is this my old regiment?"

 The 22nd did not stay long at Halls Hill. With the Army of the Potomac in disarray and the Confederates on the offensive, an attack on Washington was expected at any moment. The 22nd was shifted to several different defensive entrenchments outside of Arlington, Virginia during the first week of September. Lee, however, set out to invade Western Maryland, the lead elements of his army crossing the Potomac on September 4, 1862. McClellan was slow to react to this development, but began moving elements of the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington on September 6. On September 10, Lieutenant Colonel Tilton, having been released from <a href="Libby%20Prison">Libby Prison</a> through an officer exchange, returned to the 22nd and took command. The 22nd left Arlington on September 12. The march through Maryland was remembered by the 22nd as wearisome and profoundly dusty.

As the Union army approached, Lee chose to make a stand at <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a> along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>. The V Corps was held in reserve in the center of Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place over the course of the day. The V Corps, however, took no part in these assaults. Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not committing the V Corps which might have broken Lee's army.

Lee evacuated Sharpsburg on September 18, retreating towards Virginia. The 22nd, with other regiments of its corps, moved through the town the next day. As the Confederate army crossed over the Potomac, two divisions of the V Corps, including the 22nd Massachusetts, were ordered to cross into Virginia via Blackford's Ford at <a href="Shepherdstown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Shepherdstown, Virginia</a> (now West Virginia). The movement was an ineffective attempt on McClellan's part to prevent the escape of Lee's army. The pursuing Union forces were hit with a decisive Confederate counterattack at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shepherdstown">Battle of Shepherdstown</a> on September 20, 1862, causing the Union divisions to quickly retreat in disorder back across the Potomac. The 22nd struggled across the river and reached the Maryland shore "half drowned". The engagement ended any efforts by McClellan to pursue Lee's army.

The 22nd Massachusetts remained in camp on the Maryland side of the Potomac for more than a month. On October 30, 1862, the 22nd broke camp and began marching south into Virginia. On November 5, Lincoln removed McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac and replaced him with Major General <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. The army moved to <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Virginia">Falmouth, Virginia</a>, where Burnside spent weeks orchestrating his attack on <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg</a> just across the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a>.

The Army of the Potomac, having constructed pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock, commenced the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a> on the morning of December 13, 1862. The Confederate army occupied the city of Fredericksburg and a high ridge behind the city known as Marye's Heights. By late morning, Union forces had taken the city and began the assault on Marye's Heights. At approximately 3:30 in the afternoon the 22nd Massachusetts, with the rest of Colonel <a href="James%20Barnes%20%28General%29">James Barnes</a>'s brigade, crossed one of the pontoon bridges and moved through a railroad cut to the outskirts of the city. The regiment numbered about 200 men. Barnes's brigade was ordered to relieve a brigade of the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">IX Corps</a> which had made a charge on the stone wall along Marye's Heights and become pinned down by Confederate fire. By the time they formed up battle lines on the open slope in front of Marye's Heights, the 22nd was under intense artillery fire from the Confederates. According to the regimental historian, "the men instinctively turned their sides to the storm" of bullets, shot and shell as they advanced and casualties were heavy. Their brigade reached <a href="James%20Nagle%20%28general%29">Nagle's</a> brigade and the 22nd relieved the <a href="12th%20Rhode%20Island%20Infantry">12th Rhode Island</a>, taking shelter on ground covered by that regiment's casualties. Here the 22nd fired in prone position, exhausting their ammunition, yelling and cheering to keep up their courage.

Around nightfall, the 22nd was relieved by the <a href="20th%20Maine%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">20th Maine</a>. Falling back to a sunken road on the outskirts of Fredericksburg, the 22nd was still exposed to Confederate artillery and took cover as best they could. Many of the regiment had thrown away their haversacks in an effort to lighten their burden before the charge and were subsequently without food. During the night, they resorted to searching the haversacks of fallen soldiers for rations.

Just before dawn on December 14, ammunition was issued and the 22nd moved forward slightly, to about the position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before. Here they spent another day pinned to the ground, unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen. Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place on the field and the 22nd retired to the city of Fredericksburg.

The 22nd spent the next day, December 15, in the city of Fredericksburg, hearing rumors that Burnside intended to personally lead another assault on the heights. But no attack materialized, night came, and the V Corps crossed the pontoon bridges back to Falmouth, with the 22nd acting as rear guard. During the battle of Frederickburg, the 22nd lost 12 killed and 42 wounded, roughly 28 percent casualties.

The 22nd set up winter camp on the outskirts of Falmouth, Virginia on December 22, 1862. The camp was located about northeast of Stoneman's Station, now known as <a href="Leeland%20%28VRE%20station%29">Leeland Station</a>. The men built crude log huts with improvised chimneys made of mud and sticks. Here the regiment would remain for approximately six months during the first half of 1863. The camp was named "Camp Gove" in honor of their fallen colonel.

While at Camp Gove, the 22nd Massachusetts, with the rest of the V Corps, was frequently deployed on expeditions of varying importance. On January 20, 1863, the regiment took part in the infamous <a href="Mud%20March%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Mud March</a> during which Burnside attempted to attack the flank of the Confederate army which was still encamped at Fredericksburg. The roads were so impassable that the Union army bogged down and the entire effort was aborted. The 22nd returned to Camp Gove five days after they left.

The 22nd also participated, in a minor capacity, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>. On April 27, Brig. Gen. <a href="Charles%20Griffin">Charles Griffin</a>'s division, including the 22nd, was ordered to secure the fords along the Rapidan River. It was a long, rapid, forced march for the division. The Confederate army launched a daring and successful flank attack against the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, during which the 22nd saw little action. The Union army, badly defeated, retreated back across the Rappahannock and the 22nd returned to Camp Gove on May 8.

In late May, Colonel Tilton of the 22nd was promoted to the command of the brigade and Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Thomas%20Sherwin">Thomas Sherwin</a> assumed command of the 22nd.

On May 28, 1863, the 22nd Massachusetts packed up and left Camp Gove. Their corps was deployed along the Rappahannock, upriver of Fredericksburg, as an observation force to determine what movements were being made by Lee's army. In this, they were unsuccessful. Lee's army slipped away from Fredericksburg on June 3 and began a long march that would lead to an invasion of Pennsylvania. The 22nd learned of Lee's movements on June 13 when the V Corps was ordered to march northward. By this time, the entire Army of the Potomac was on the move. The two armies would eventually meet, almost three weeks later, at <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>.

By June 30, 1863, the 22nd had reached <a href="Union%20Mills%2C%20Maryland">Union Mills, Maryland</a> after weeks of hard marching. On July 1, they marched to <a href="Hanover%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hanover, Pennsylvania</a>, completely unaware that elements of the Army of the Potomac had engaged the Confederates some away in the first day of fighting during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. Not long after they settled down for the evening, orders came for them to march. The 22nd, and the rest of the V Corps, marched through the night to Gettysburg, reaching the battle around dawn on July 2. The V Corps was stationed well behind the center of the Union lines, awaiting deployment to one flank or the other. The men of the 22nd fell to the ground and caught a few hours sleep even as the second morning of battle raged not far from their position. At Gettysburg, the regiment had only 67 men.

At about 4 p.m., the V Corps was ordered to advance in support of the <a href="III%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">III Corps</a>. Barnes's division passed north of <a href="Little%20Round%20Top">Little Round Top</a> and deployed just south of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day%23Wheatfield">Wheatfield</a> along a small, stony hill within sight of the Rose farmhouse which was directly in their front. Once deployed, the soldiers of the 22nd began to pile paper cartridges on the ground in front of them, sensing they would be holding that ground for some time.

As the III Corps retreated, Tilton's brigade was directly exposed to the oncoming Confederates. The 22nd was soon engaged by <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Kershaw">Kershaw</a>'s brigade of South Carolinians. Apparently unnerved by the sudden Confederate advance and perceiving that his right flank was exposed, Brig. Gen. Barnes, the 22nd's division commander, ordered the withdrawal of his division. The men of the 22nd picked up their cartridges and yielded the ground. This withdrawal back across the Wheatfield to Trostle's Farm left a gap in the Union line. Barnes and Tilton were both subject to much criticism from other officers on the field for this withdrawal, which Barnes apparently ordered without consulting his superiors. The gap left by Barnes's division was eventually filled by brigades of the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">II Corps</a> after hard fighting. The 22nd fought from their new position along a stone wall on Trostle's Farm and was eventually pulled back to the north side of Little Round Top by about 6 p.m.

On the third and final day of the Battle of Gettysburg, the 22nd was posted in the ravine between Little Round Top and <a href="Big%20Round%20Top">Big Round Top</a>. The ground was heavily wooded and rocky. Here they piled up stones and took shelter from the Confederate sharpshooters in <a href="Devil%27s%20Den">Devil's Den</a> about to their front. The regiment remained in this position while <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>, Lee's unsuccessful attempt to break Union lines, took place well north of the 22nd's position.

During the Battle of Gettysburg, the regiment suffered 15 killed and 25 wounded or 60 percent. In terms of percentages, this represented the regiment's highest number of casualties in an individual battle.

On September 9, 1863, the 22nd was reinforced by 200 draftees, once again fielding respectable numbers. During the latter half of 1863, the 22nd was involved in some minor engagements along the Rappahannock River including the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Rappahannock%20Station">Second Battle of Rappahannock Station</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mine%20Run">Battle of Mine Run</a>. No significant progress was made by the Army of the Potomac that fall, and the 22nd settled into a camp near <a href="Brandy%20Station%2C%20Virginia">Brandy Station, Virginia</a> which they named "Camp Barnes" after their division commander who had been wounded at Gettysburg. In March 1864, Col. Tilton was relieved of command of his brigade and returned to the command of the 22nd Massachusetts.

On April 30, 1864, the 22nd broke camp and marched southeast from Rappahannock Station. Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant had now assumed command of Union forces as <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">general-in-chief</a> and although Major General <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a> remained in command of the Army of the Potomac, Grant was determined to follow the army in the field, directing its movements. The resulting campaign during the spring of 1864 was known as the <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> and saw relentless attacks on the part of the Union army under Grant. The reinforced 22nd began the campaign with about 300 men. By the close of the campaign, the regiment would be reduced to about 100.

During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Battle of the Wilderness</a> on May 5–6, 1864, the regiment lost 15 killed and 36 wounded. The regiment was heavily engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania">Battle of Spotsylvania</a> on May 9–10. On May 10, the 22nd was ordered to take a line of rifle pits that had been abandoned by Union troops and taken by the Confederates. The 22nd deployed as skirmishers under the command of <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> Mason Burt and advanced under heavy fire. The regiment was successful in taking the Confederate position, but at a heavy cost of 17 killed and 57 wounded, nearly 50 percent. During the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Anna">North Anna</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Totopotomoy%20Creek">Totopotomoy Creek</a>, the 22nd acted again as skirmishers, winning praise for their maneuvers in advance of their division.

By this time, Grant had pushed Lee's army south to within of Richmond. The final assault of the Overland Campaign came with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Battle of Cold Harbor</a>—a number of futile attempts by Grant over the course of June 1–3 to break the heavily entrenched Confederate lines. The 22nd was active during all three days of the battle, particularly on June 3 when they were again deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade, now commanded by Col. <a href="Jacob%20B.%20Sweitzer">Jacob B. Sweitzer</a>, in the vicinity of Bethesda Church. Sweitzer's brigade, with the 22nd in the advance, made a charge across open ground, pushing back the Confederate forces in their front. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, the 22nd lost 11 killed and 11 wounded, now numbering less than 100.

Lee's army now dug in around <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a> and the long <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a> commenced with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position. The 22nd took part in the assault on June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade. They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy <a href="canister%20shot">canister fire</a>, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.

During the latter part of June 1864, the 22nd was marched to several different positions along the siege lines outside of Petersburg, expecting to participate in another assault. Finally, around June 30, 1864, the regiment was stationed in the trenches and remained there for six weeks.

On August 8, 1864, the 22nd was pulled from the trenches and posted on guard duty at <a href="City%20Point%2C%20Virginia">City Point, Virginia</a>, the main supply depot of the Union army. Maj. Gen. Meade had specifically requested a depleted unit whose term of service was nearly up for this duty. They remained there until October 3, their three years of service having expired. Those of the regiment who had chosen to re-enlist, along with the remaining draftees who had joined the unit in 1863, were consolidated with the <a href="32nd%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">32nd Massachusetts</a>. The remaining men of the 22nd who had served their three years and did not wish to re-enlist, 125 in number, returned to Boston by railroad, arriving on October 10. After ceremonies in Boston, the regiment was officially mustered out on October 17, 1864.

After the war, several former members of the 22nd Massachusetts went on to achieve notable accomplishments in various fields.

Senator Henry Wilson, founder of the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery political stance. After the war, he became one of the leading <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> in Congress, pressing for civil rights for former slaves and harsh treatment of former Confederates. In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his "History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power", a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.

<a href="Nelson%20A.%20Miles">Nelson A. Miles</a> joined the 22nd Massachusetts as a first lieutenant but was soon transferred. In 1862, he became colonel of the 61st New York Infantry. After the war, Miles became a colonel in the Regular Army and steadily rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming the <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Commanding General of the United States Army</a> in 1895.

<a href="Arthur%20Soden">Arthur Soden</a> served as a <a href="Hospital%20Steward">hospital steward</a> with the 22nd Massachusetts. After the war, he went on to become an influential figure during the formative years of Major League Baseball as president of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Boston%20Braves">Boston Red Stockings</a> and, briefly, as the president of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>.

<a href="Marshall%20S.%20Pike">Marshall S. Pike</a> was a well-known singer, poet and songwriter before the war. He served as <a href="drum%20major">drum major</a> for the 22nd regimental band and was taken captive at the battle of Gaines' Mill. After his release in December 1862, he was discharged and resumed his career as an entertainer and songwriter.

As the remains of the regiment were en route back to Boston in October 1864, the officers met to form a regimental association to organize annual reunions of the officers. These reunions were eventually opened to enlisted men and the reunions became large events. In 1870, the regimental association was more formally organized with the election of officers and the establishment of by-laws. Its purpose was "to preserve the history and perpetuate [the 22nd's] deeds and their men". The reunions were typically held at the <a href="Omni%20Parker%20House%2319th%20century">Parker House</a> in Boston. The association organized a number of projects in honor of the 22nd's former members including placing a bust of Henry Wilson in the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">Massachusetts State House</a> and the construction, in 1885, of the 22nd Massachusetts regimental monument near the Wheatfield on the Gettysburg battlefield.

The 22nd Massachusetts is memorialized by a group of Civil War <a href="Historical%20reenactment">re-enactors</a>, the 22nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Inc., who portray Company D of the regiment at various civic events, educational programs, and Civil War re-enactments. The group is based on the <a href="South%20Shore%20%28Massachusetts%29">South Shore</a> of Massachusetts.

Crush (video game)

Crush is a <a href="platform%20game">platformer</a>-<a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle video game</a> developed by <a href="Kuju%20Entertainment">Kuju Entertainment</a>'s Zoë Mode studio and published by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> in <a href="2007%20in%20video%20gaming">2007</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>. Its protagonist is Danny, a young man suffering from <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, who uses an experimental device to explore his mind and discover the cause of his sleeplessness. Each level of the game, representing events from Danny's life and inspired by artists such as <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> and <a href="M.C.%20Escher">M.C. Escher</a>, requires the player to control Danny as he collects his "lost marbles" and other thoughts.

"Crush"s primary gameplay feature involves manipulating each game level between <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> and <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> views, allowing the player to reach platforms and locations inaccessible from within a different view. This element was noted by critics to be similar to one in "<a href="Super%20Paper%20Mario">Super Paper Mario</a>", also released in 2007, though the Zoë Mode team had envisioned the concept five years prior. "Crush" received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its incorporation of this dimension-shifting component alongside other aspects of the game presentation. Though "Crush" won several gaming awards, including PSP game of the month, it failed to meet the developer's sales expectations. A port of the game for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> called "CRUSH3D" was announced on January 19, 2011 and was made available on January 13, 2012 in Europe; on February 9, 2012 in Australia; on February 23, 2012 in Japan (as ); and on March 6, 2012 in North America.

While "Crush" and its <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> port "CRUSH3D" retain the same gameplay mechanics and premise, the two versions feature different plots.

The protagonist of the game, a young man named Danny Roman, suffers from chronic <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a> caused by worry, stress, and repressed memories. He is admitted to a mental institution for it, where he consults a mad scientist, Dr. Reubens, who treats Danny with his Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics (C.R.U.S.H.) device, which has a sentient female persona. The device's helmet places Danny under hypnosis, during which he can regain control of his sanity by collecting his <a href="Marble%20%28toy%29%23Marbles%20in%20culture">lost marbles</a>, and facing his primal fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, blockwalkers, slugs). Danny starts spilling the beans to Reubens about his city life; moving into his first apartment and his suffering job as a chef. He depends on Reubens for some serious help if he wants to get a good night's sleep. Later, when C.R.U.S.H. projects the image of a bucket and shovel at the beach onto the helmet, he recalls his love life some few years ago with a girl named Tina (who Reubens mistakenly thought was Danny's mother, a recurring joke). Returning the next summer, Danny is jilted for a more handsome man. Devastated, Danny ends up sitting on the pier in shame, accidentally falling into the ocean below, but eventually rescued. Reubens explains that the rejection causes him to distance himself from women, and tells him to get some rest. The next day, while Dr. Reubens tunes up his machine, making questionable noises, Danny recommends he give them some time alone, but the word "alone" has Reubens lead Danny to recollect the time he was assaulted as a young boy at a local <a href="funfair">funfair</a> by three thugs, however, Danny blames himself, not his parents, for his mistake, as he ditched his parents to go to the funfair alone, but they find and rescue him (again). He then promised his parents that he'd "stay with them forever." Dr. Reubens uses this evidence to come to a conclusion that homesickness is the cause of his insomnia, recommending that Danny moves back into his parents' house, but his conclusion is proved wrong when Danny returns one more time. Dr. Reubens snaps at Danny for wearing out his machine further, and questions if he is merely "toying" with them. Pushing the limit, Reubens regresses Danny all the way to his childhood, when he was only six years old, against Danny's own will. Danny cries, begging that Reubens stop "unlocking doors that should stay bolted," but in the end, he reveals that his parents went out on a date and left him at his house alone, with disturbing shadows of the night leaving Danny in psychological trauma. Danny discovers that his childhood fears at that time, principally being afraid of the dark, are the real cause his insomnia, sending him "spiraling back into [his] six-year-old self." Reubens is full of disgust that his treatment was a complete waste and that Danny ruined his machine due to his <a href="nyctophobia">nyctophobia</a>, but tells Danny he's cured. Right when Reubens begins to snap Danny out of hypnosis, C.R.U.S.H. goes over the edge and seems to attack Danny's mind, with Reubens panicking and Danny's life on the line while the screen fades to black at the start of the attempt.

Doctor 'Doc' Doccerson (instead of Reubens in the PSP version), is infuriated that all of his inventions failed, but today he 'shall surpass them all' with his latest invention, C.R.U.S.H. He uses a tape recorder for his scientific narrative on the experiment. With the help of his best friend and protégé, Danny (a running gag consists of him correcting Doc throughout the game), he enters his mind as his subject to C.R.U.S.H., but after a few tests, Danny is trapped inside C.R.U.S.H., where he can collect his lost marbles (which will unlock new dressing gowns/robe designs) and facing his fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, slugs). At one point, Doc tells Danny that C.R.U.S.H. will not let Danny out due to "unresolved feelings." The two question that reasoning as they progress. Towards the end, C.R.U.S.H. interrupts contact between Danny and Doc, overly infatuated with Danny. Danny slowly admits to C.R.U.S.H. that she is simply a machine and compares it to "flirting with a parking meter." C.R.U.S.H., infuriated, sends Danny back to his childhood as a result. When Doc comes back into contact with Danny, Danny lashes out at Doc for building a machine "with the heart of a teenage girl" who "LOLd" at him. Doc, calming Danny down, explains how this "subconscious" is not really his, but old data, and suddenly Danny becomes shocked when he realizes he took the place of someone who underwent treatment with C.R.U.S.H. (being the PSP Danny), but "she knows [he's] not the same." C.R.U.S.H. really wanted Danny to clear her head. In the ending, Danny finally escapes and is free out of C.R.U.S.H's mind. He and Doc discuss C.R.U.S.H's future, while Doc says that he'll fix her. In a sudden plot twist, it turns out that they were not in the real world at all, but all the levels throughout the game are outside Doc's lab. C.R.U.S.H. smiles and laughs into the camera, she winks and the screen cuts to black.

"Crush" contains ten levels in each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.

The main gameplay feature of "Crush" is the ability to transpose the layout of a level between 2D and 3D representations to reach seemingly inaccessible areas and solve the game's puzzles. The player can switch the <a href="third-person%20perspective">third-person camera</a> between four directional side views and a top-down view at any time while in 3D. When in these views, the player can have Danny "crush" the level, collapsing all 3D elements into 2D; crushing from side views results in a 2D <a href="platformer">platformer</a>-like view, while crushing from the top-down view provides a 2D <a href="top-down%20perspective">top-down perspective</a>. Crushing can connect and merge platforms on the same visual plane in the 3D view but separated by a large distance, creating pathways across the level in the 2D view. The player can also "uncrush" the level at any time. Certain blocks, when crushed, become either obstacles through which Danny cannot pass, or ledges the player can use to reach other parts of the level. Attempts to crush a level in any manner that would harm Danny are thwarted. However, uncrushing can leave Danny in a helpless state, such as hanging in mid-air.

Enemy monsters inhabit the levels, but the player can crush them by flattening impassable blocks against them. The player may also encounter timers in the form of alarm clocks that will begin to elapse when crushed for the first time and can only be stopped when Danny jumps on them. Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.

Throughout the levels are scattered large spheres and cylinders, which the player can roll when crushed appropriately. These can then be used as platforms or to depress switches. <a href="Jigsaw%20puzzle">Jigsaw pieces</a> can be collected to reveal concept art and extras in the game's menus. Some of Danny's "thoughts", represented by glowing neon icons on the walls of the level, are only activated when the level is crushed in a manner that does not obscure them. Some thoughts allow Danny to jump higher or stop time. Once the player completes each level, they are graded by the duration of Danny's stay on the level, how many times Danny "woke up", and a bonus for collecting all marbles, the jigsaw piece, and a hidden thought trophy. The thought trophy, once completed by crushing, unlocks a level's special challenge mode for later play which requires time-limited completion of the level with an allotted number of crushes.

In an interview, Zoë Mode executive producer Paul Mottram claimed that the game concept was envisioned in 2002, but work did not actually begin until 2006. The initial concept was built on the crushing mechanism between 2D and 3D, and they only had to create appropriate obstacles to prevent players from simply "crushing" across the level. Mottram noted that during the development of "Crush", the gameplay of "<a href="Super%20Paper%20Mario">Super Paper Mario</a>" had not yet been revealed, and thus the team was surprised to learn that it shared a similar feature.

Mottram stated that the crushing mechanism had been developed and refined for six months before developing the story and characters; the development team wanted to have "a normal person in an impossible situation". The art and level design were inspired by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="Mike%20Mignola">Mike Mignola</a>, and <a href="M.C.%20Escher">M.C. Escher</a>. The plot was originally more morbid than in the final product, with Danny dying and the rest of the game told as <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>s.

The game levels were developed on a <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a> on the PlayStation Portable, but Zoë Mode were not able to refine the editor in time for shipping. Mottram said "It would be great to see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future" and that downloadable content "would work perfectly with the "Crush" level structure and I am sure that fans of the game would be eager to see more levels." Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as "<a href="SingStar">SingStar</a>" and "Play" taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.

"Crush" received "favorable" reviews, while "CRUSH3D" received "average" reviews, according to the <a href="Review%20aggregator">review aggregation</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. The PSP version was highly praised for its innovative approach to gameplay. Ryan Davis of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> appreciated "Crush" for owing "very little of its novel concept to games that preceded it". Nick Suttner of "<a href="1UP.com">1UP</a>" called the game a "cognitively rewarding, expertly designed puzzle experience that truly plays like nothing else". Reviews were mixed on the game's <a href="learning%20curve">learning curve</a>. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Jeremy Dunham praised the ordering of the puzzle elements, that new gaming elements are introduced at "an ideal pace", and that most puzzles have solutions where the player must "think 'outside the box'". "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>"s Dan Whitehead commented that the game introduces these elements too quickly and "doesn't give you much time to put the basics into practice". Some critics found that elements of the game detracted from the game's uniqueness. "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>"s Greg Orlando, while stating that this was "one of the most novel games ever made", noted that it was "simply not very fun", as it lacked many player incentives beyond manipulating the world and collecting objects on each level. Reviewers noted that some puzzles were awkward due to the selection of the PlayStation Portable's controls. Reviewers found the game's story poor, but this was overcome by the gameplay elements; Charles Herold of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said "the minimal story is as forgettable as its puzzles are ingenious." Gus Mastrapa of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" said that the game "satisfies the innate gamer need to express the world in easy-to-manipulate numbers and objects." <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> included "Crush" in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli stated that the ability to switch from 2D to 3D was "one of the most unique (at the time) features we’ve ever seen."

"The Digital Fix"s Ryan Poxon gave "CRUSH3D" a score of seven out of ten and called it a "puzzle game that genuinely surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it a score of 6.6 out of 10 and said, "For a puzzle game, "Crush 3D" is a good choice for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." However, "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>"s Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: "Despite the five-year gap between releases, "Crush 3D" takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very little in the way of brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, "Crush 3D" gets it right where it counts." In Japan, "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.

IGN awarded "Crush" PSP Game of the Month for May 2007. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> called "Crush" the third best PlayStation Portable game and the "PSP Puzzle Game of the Year" for its Game of the Year 2007 awards. Similarly, IGN awarded Crush the "Best PSP Puzzle Game", "Most Innovative PSP Game", and "Best PSP Game No One Played" awards in their Game of the Year 2007 selections. "Crush" won the 2007 Develop Conference Industry Award for "Best New Handheld IP". According to Paul Mottram, positive reception of the game did not translate into high sales, but the game "will hopefully stick around for a while and continue to shift units". <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> made "Crush" a nominee for "Best PSP Game" in its Game of the Year Awards 2007.

Aries (album)

Aries is the ninth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Mexican recording artist <a href="Luis%20Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>. It was released by <a href="WEA%20Latina">WEA Latina</a> on 22 June 1993. After attaining commercial success in 1991 with his previous album, "<a href="Romance%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romance</a>", Miguel decided to return to a style similar to his earlier work, featuring <a href="pop%20ballad">pop ballad</a>s and dance numbers with R&B influences. The record was produced by Miguel, who was assisted by Kiko Cibrian, <a href="Rudy%20P%C3%A9rez">Rudy Pérez</a>, <a href="David%20Foster">David Foster</a>, and <a href="Juan%20Luis%20Guerra">Juan Luis Guerra</a>.

Three singles were released to promote the album. The first two singles, "Ayer" and "Hasta Que Me Olvides", topped the US <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart and the third, "Suave", peaked at number nine. Two other songs were released as promotional singles, "Hasta el Fin" and "Tú y Yo"; both peaked at number four on the Hot Latin Songs chart. To further promote the record, Miguel launched the 1993 <a href="Aries%20Tour">Aries Tour</a> to some Latin American countries and the United States.

"Aries" peaked at number one on the US <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a>, where it stayed for 19 weeks. Internationally, the album was certified triple platinum in Mexico, where it sold over one million copies. It was also <a href="List%20of%20diamond-certified%20albums%20in%20Argentina">certified diamond in Argentina</a>. "Aries" sold over two million copies worldwide through 2000. Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a>; they were divided on the dance tunes and ballads, although Miguel's vocals and the album's arrangements garnered positive reactions. Miguel received several accolades, including the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album</a>.

In 1991 Miguel released his eighth studio album, "<a href="Romance%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romance</a>", a collection of classic <a href="bolero">bolero</a>s, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a> and arranged by <a href="Bebu%20Silvetti">Bebu Silvetti</a>, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre and was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be <a href="record%20certification">certified gold</a> in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to "Romance". When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied "I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies; ... The creation of an album has to be part of me or else I would not be able to interpret it, or sing in it".

On 24 August 1992, Mexican newspaper "<a href="El%20Siglo%20de%20Torre%C3%B3n">El Siglo de Torreón</a>" reported that Miguel had begun collaborating with <a href="David%20Foster">David Foster</a> and <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Juan Carlos Calderón</a> on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting <a href="cover%20versions">cover versions</a> for the album. He also received assistance from Cuban composer <a href="Rudy%20P%C3%A9rez">Rudy Pérez</a> and Dominican singer-songwriter <a href="Juan%20Luis%20Guerra">Juan Luis Guerra</a> with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer <a href="Bruce%20Swedien">Bruce Swedien</a>, but decided to re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a>. Miguel announced that the name of the album would be "Aries" during a presentation at the 1993 <a href="Acafest">Festival Acapulco</a>. About the naming of the album he said, "This album expresses my personal self. I had a lot to do. I produced everything and wanted to have a lot of fun, take what I like, and what better than the zodiacal sign representing what one is."

"Aries" is composed of ten tracks, six of which are <a href="Sentimental%20ballad">"romance-themed" ballads</a>. The rest of the album consists of four <a href="dance-pop">dance</a> numbers which "<a href="San%20Antonio%20Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a>" editor Ramiro Burr describes as "pop groove" and <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> influences, and compared them to Miguel's earlier recordings before "Romance". Miguel said the mixture of ballads and uptempo music was done to "keep a steady musical line" because he did not want his music to be unrecognizable. The dance tunes "Suave", "Dame Tu Amor", and "Que Nivel de Mujer" are "upbeat, <a href="Brass%20instrument">brass-heavy</a>, attitudinal numbers" while "Luz Verde" incorporates <a href="Latin%20hip%20hop">Latin hip hop</a> and R&B. "Suave" features a saxophone solo by American musician <a href="Kirk%20Whalum">Kirk Whalum</a> and "Que Nivel de Mujer" is a Spanish-language adaptation of "Attitude Dance" by American band <a href="Tower%20of%20Power">Tower of Power</a>. The band members assisted with the <a href="horn%20section">horn section</a> in the song, which was led by one of its lead members Emilio Castillo. Miguel said he included the band's song on the album because of his fondness for R&B in the 1970s, citing the group as one of his musical influences.

"Ayer" is a Spanish-language cover of David Foster's instrumental "All That My Heart Can Hold" with additional lyrics by Rudy Pérez. Burr characterized the song as a "lush ballad sung by Miguel in his stylistic
romantic swagger that simultaneously conveys pride and pain". Similarly, John Lannert wrote for the "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>" that the track was comparable to "Romance"s "sparse lyrical muse and smooth musical backdrop". Lannert also called Juan Luis Guerra's composition "Hasta Que Me Olvides" an "emotion-drenched love ode" and referred to "Me Niego Estar Solo" and "Hasta El Fin" as "desperate confessionals about being out of love". <a href="Achy%20Obejas">Achy Obejas</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" labeled the ballads "Hasta El Fin" and "Tú y Yo" as "luxuriantly slow narratives of love lost".

"Ayer" was released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from "Aries" on 17 May 1993. It reached number one on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart in the United States the week of 17 July 1993, and stayed there for three weeks. The three music videos for "Ayer" were directed by Benny Corral, Rubén Galindo, and <a href="Gustavo%20Garz%C3%B3n">Gustavo Garzón</a> respectively. The music videos were filmed in a mansion in Mexico City. "Ayer" ended 1993 as the sixth-<a href="Billboard%20Top%20Latin%20Songs%20Year-End%20Chart">best-performing Latin song of the year</a> in the US. The album's second single, "Hasta Que Me Olvides", was released in August 1993 and reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart the week of October 23, and remained there for three weeks. The album's third single, "Suave", was released in September 1993 and peaked at number nine on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Its music video was directed by Kiko Guerrero and features Miguel dancing with several women on a beach. "Hasta el Fin" and "Tú y Yo" were released as <a href="promotional%20recording">promotional singles</a> in the US and both peaked at number four on the Hot Latin Songs chart. "Pensar en Ti" received airplay in Mexico, while "Me Niego a Estar Solo" was released as a promotional single in Spain in 1993.

To promote the album, Miguel began his <a href="Aries%20Tour">Aries Tour</a> on 22 May at the 1993 Acapulco Festival in Mexico. After his performances in Mexico, he toured several countries in Latin America beginning with Argentina, and later performed in the US. His set list consisted mainly of pop songs and ballads from "Aries" and his earlier career, as well as boleros from "Romance", which he performed during the second half of the concerts.

Upon its release, "Aries" received mixed reactions from music critics. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor Jose F. Promis gave the album 2.5 stars out of five and found the ballads to be "sometimes a little too syrupy". He complimented some of the dance tunes such as "Suave" and "Dame Tu Amor", but said "Luz Verde" was a "somewhat dated attempt at early-'90s Latin hip-hop R&B". A music journalist for "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine wrote a favorable review of "Aries", stating that Miguel "trades in nostalgic boleros for a stylish, up-to-date package" and called "Ayer" a "perfect transition track from "Romance"". "Chicago Tribune" music critic Achy Obejas gave the record 2.5 stars out of four, calling it "a kind of middle ground between "Romance" and its lush ballads, and the bouncy pop of "20 Años," its immediate antecedent". She praised Miguel's vocals as "wonderfully nuanced and dramatic", and said the ballads mostly "work", but that "the uptempo tunes fall flat most of the time". Enrique Lopetegui of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" gave the album three stars out of four; he lauded Miguel's inclusion of "healthy elements of jazz and funk into his polished sound" and said he "returns to familiar territory accompanied by his usual superb arrangements and musicianship".

At the <a href="36th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">36th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 1994, Miguel won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album</a> for "Aries". At the <a href="Premio%20Lo%20Nuestro%201994">6th Lo Nuestro Awards</a> in the same year, the album won the award for <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Album of the Year</a> and Miguel was named <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Male%20Artist%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Male Artist of the Year</a>. He also received two nominations in the category of <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Pop%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Pop Song of the Year</a> for "Hasta Que Me Olvides" and "Ayer"; the latter track was also nominated <a href="Lo%20Nuestro%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a>. At the inaugural <a href="Billboard%20Latin%20Music%20Awards">"Billboard" Latin Music Awards</a> in 1994, Miguel received two awards including Pop Album of the Year and Pop Male Artist of the Year. Miguel was awarded Best Male Singer, Best Male Show for the tour, and Best Disc for the album at the 1994 "Eres" awards.

"Aries" was released internationally on 22 June 1993, although <a href="piracy%20%28media%29">pirated</a> cassettes of the album were being sold for $1 in Mexico ten days before the official release. WEA Latina prepared 500,000 copies to be distributed on the release date, but after finding legitimate copies of the compact disc were already being sold on the pirate market, they discovered only 300,000 units stored in their warehouse. WEA Latina responded to the piracy by having a Mexican radio station play the whole album a few days before its release. In Mexico, the album was certified triple platinum; it has sold over one million copies in the country. In the US, it debuted and peaked at number two on the <a href="Top%20Latin%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Latin Albums</a> chart, second to <a href="Gloria%20Estefan">Gloria Estefan</a>'s album "<a href="Mi%20Tierra">Mi Tierra</a>". "Aries" remained in this position until it was replaced by the <a href="Gipsy%20Kings">Gipsy Kings</a>'s album "<a href="Love%20and%20Libert%C3%A9">Love and Liberté</a>" 20 weeks later.

"Aries" peaked at number one on the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a> chart and stayed at the top for 19 weeks. It ended 1993 as the second best-selling Latin pop album in the US after "Romance". In Argentina, the album peaked at number two on the album chart and was certified diamond by the <a href="Argentine%20Chamber%20of%20Phonograms%20and%20Videograms%20Producers">Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers</a> for sales of 500,000 copies. Elsewhere in South America, the album peaked at number one on the Chilean albums chart and was certified platinum in Colombia. "Aries" sold over two million copies worldwide through 2000.

All recordings produced by Luis Miguel and Kiko Cibrian, except where noted.

Report of 1800

The Report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> arguing for the <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of the individual <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a> under the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> and against the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>. Adopted by the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> in January 1800, the Report amends arguments from the 1798 <a href="Virginia%20Resolutions">Virginia Resolutions</a> and attempts to resolve contemporary criticisms against the Resolutions. The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the <a href="Bonus%20Bill%20of%201817">1817 Bonus Bill</a> veto message by Madison, who has come to be regarded as the "Father of the Constitution."

The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the <a href="nullification%20crisis">nullification crisis</a> of 1832, when <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> declared federal <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of <a href="Republicanism">Republicanism</a> really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.

Madison, a member of the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic-Republican Party</a>, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Virginia">Orange County</a> in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 <a href="Virginia%20Resolutions">Virginia Resolutions</a>, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually discussed together with <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s contemporaneous <a href="Kentucky%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a>, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist</a>-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, four laws that allowed the President to deport <a href="alien%20%28law%29">aliens</a> at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become <a href="citizen">citizen</a>s, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> state legislatures.

The <a href="Kentucky%20and%20Virginia%20Resolutions">Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions</a> had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of <a href="Caroline%20County%2C%20Virginia">Caroline</a>, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.

Jefferson, the leader of the Democratic-Republican Party and then–<a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a>, wrote to Madison in August 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for the principles expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 (commonly referred to as "the principles of '98"):

In response to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at <a href="Monticello">Monticello</a> during the first week of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to <a href="Wilson%20Cary%20Nicholas">Wilson Cary Nicholas</a> that: "From [this position] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [Madison's] judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views."

Jefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at <a href="Montpelier%20%28James%20Madison%29">Montpelier</a> on his way to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, the national capital, for the winter session of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. However, <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year, visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison, since another meeting between two of the most important Democratic-Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment. The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison. Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified "protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution" as one of the four primary elements of the Democratic-Republican Party plan.

The Assembly session began in early December. Once at <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, Madison began drafting the Report, though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery. On December 23, Madison moved for the creation of a special seven-member committee with himself as chairman to respond to "certain answers from several of the states, relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session." The committee members were Madison, <a href="John%20Taylor%20of%20Caroline">John Taylor</a>, <a href="William%20Branch%20Giles">William Branch Giles</a>, George Keith Taylor, John Wise, John Mercer, and William Daniel. The next day, Christmas Eve, the committee produced a first version of the Report. The measure came before the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, on January 2.

Though certain to pass due to the Democratic-Republican majority, which had recently been solidified by the election of a Democratic-Republican clerk and speaker of the House, the Report was debated for five days. The main point of contention was the meaning of the third of the Virginia Resolutions:

This resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the "states" were parties to the federal Constitution, the referent of the word "state" was the sovereign people of the particular state. Thus, to say that "the state of Virginia ratified the Constitution" was to say that the sovereign people of Virginia ratified the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.

The Report was received warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state, but there was not much public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201800">presidential election of 1800</a> (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> in general, particularly in its advancement of the <a href="Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a> rather than the <a href="Ninth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Ninth</a> as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.

The general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles expressed in the <a href="Virginia%20Resolutions">Virginia Resolutions</a>. The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures. Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution. Laying into the Acts in his Report, Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits. The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens. Contrary to the Sedition Act, the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack, beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen; indeed, such special intervention against the press was "expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution." As well, Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional.

To remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to "a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it." <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20press">Freedom of the press</a> was necessary, because "chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression." The Report supported a strict interpretation of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.

More generally, the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the <a href="compact%20theory">compact theory</a>. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.

In defense of Virginia Democratic-Republicans and the Resolutions, Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory, the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests, which states were surely entitled to produce. Madison indicated that a declaration of unconstitutionality would be an expression of opinion, with no legal force. The purpose of such a declaration, said Madison, was to mobilize public opinion. Madison indicated that the power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts:

It has been said, that it belongs to the judiciary of the United States, and not the state legislatures, to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution. ...

[T]he declarations of [the citizens or the state legislature], whether affirming or denying the constitutionality of measures of the Federal Government ... are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force. The former may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the <a href="general%20will">general will</a>; possibly to a change in the opinion of the judiciary; the latter enforces the general will, whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged.

Madison argued that a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by communicating with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried to make clear that the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.

The Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Democratic-Republican principles. <a href="Spencer%20Roane">Spencer Roane</a> described it as "the "<a href="Magna%20Charta">Magna Charta</a>" on which the republicans settled down, after the great struggle in the year 1799." <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> said on the floor of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> that it was from the Report of 1800, above other documents, that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation. <a href="H.%20Jefferson%20Powell">H. Jefferson Powell</a>, a modern jurist, identifies three persistent themes of Democratic-Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report: (1) a textual approach to the Constitution, (2) the compact theory, and (3) that caution, not trust, should characterize our approach to those who hold political power.

In more recent years, the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment. Multiple <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers' ideas on free speech. In the 1957 "<a href="Roth%20v.%20United%20States">Roth v. United States</a>" opinion by <a href="William%20J.%20Brennan%2C%20Jr.">William Brennan</a>, Madison's Report is cited as evidence that "the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth." Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include "<a href="Thornhill%20v.%20Alabama">Thornhill v. Alabama</a>" (1940) and "<a href="Nixon%20v.%20Shrink%20Missouri%20Government%20PAC">Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC</a>" (2000).

In modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights with regard to <a href="federalism">federalism</a> and <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>. According to <a href="Kevin%20Gutzman">Kevin Gutzman</a>, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the "radical southern states' rights tradition." However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-<a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullification</a> Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of "the people in each of the States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity." The state governments themselves, no less than the federal judiciary, possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Nullification">Ordinance of Nullification</a> was not.

Operation Paravane

Operation Paravane was a British air raid of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> that inflicted heavy damage on the <a href="German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">German battleship "Tirpitz"</a>. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s, which flew from an airfield in the north of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered "Tirpitz" unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.

The attack on 15 September followed a series of raids conducted against "Tirpitz" by <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> aircraft carriers between April and August 1944 that sought to sink or disable the battleship at her anchorage in <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a> in the far north of <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">German-occupied</a> Norway, so that she no longer posed a threat to Allied convoys travelling to and from the Soviet Union. While the first of these raids was successful, the other attacks failed due to shortcomings with the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a>'s strike aircraft and the formidable German defences. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to the RAF's <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a>. <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> bombers from the Command's two elite squadrons flew to their staging airfield in the Soviet Union on the night of 11/12 September, and attacked on 15 September using heavy bombs and air-dropped mines. All of the British aircraft returned to base, though one of the Lancasters later crashed during its flight back to the United Kingdom.

Following Operation Paravane, the German Navy's commander decided to use "Tirpitz" as a static artillery battery to protect the town of <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>. The Allies were unable to confirm the extent of the battleship's damage, and conducted two further heavy bomber raids against her in late 1944. "Tirpitz" was sunk with considerable loss of life on 12 November during the second of these attacks.

From early 1942, "Tirpitz" posed a significant threat to the <a href="Arctic%20convoys%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied convoys</a> transporting supplies through the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> to the Soviet Union. Stationed in <a href="fjord">fjord</a>s on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. Due to the superiority of the Allied navies, "Tirpitz" rarely put to sea, and only conducted three brief combat operations into the Norwegian Sea during her career. However, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> to counter the threat she posed, and <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.

<a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) heavy bombers conducted a series of unsuccessful raids on "Tirpitz" shortly after the battleship arrived in Norway from Germany in January 1942. "Tirpitz" was initially based at <a href="F%C3%A6ttenfjord">Fættenfjord</a> near <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, which lay within range of British bombers flying from Scotland. The first raid took place on 30 January, and involved nine <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> and seven <a href="Short%20Stirling">Short Stirling</a> bombers. Due to cloud over the target area, only one of the bombers sighted "Tirpitz" and none inflicted any damage. One Halifax crashed into the sea on its way back to Scotland, but its crew were rescued. The next raid on Fættenfjord took place on 30 March, with the attacking force comprising 33 Halifaxes. The operation was again frustrated by heavy clouds over the target area. Four of the Halifaxes were shot down, and two others crashed while returning to base. Another attack was mounted by 30 Halifaxes and 11 <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>s on the night of 27/28 April. "Tirpitz" was located and attacked by the aircraft of the first wave, but no damage was inflicted and five heavy bombers were lost. The final raid in this series took place the next night, and involved 21 Halifaxes and 12 Lancasters. The attackers found "Tirpitz" covered in a protective smokescreen, and the battleship again escaped damage; two British aircraft were destroyed.
Although plans for further heavy bomber attacks on "Tirpitz" were developed throughout 1942, none took place. One of the options considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a> <a href="Handley%20Page%20Hampden">Handley Page Hampden</a> torpedo bombers operated from <a href="Severomorsk">Vaenga</a> in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter "Tirpitz" or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not make contact with the enemy.

Further plans for air attacks on "Tirpitz" were developed during 1943, but none eventuated. During 1942 and 1943 British inventor <a href="Barnes%20Wallis">Barnes Wallis</a> attempted to develop a version of his "<a href="bouncing%20bomb">bouncing bomb</a>" concept for use against "Tirpitz" alongside the larger weapons that were used to attack several German dams during <a href="Operation%20Chastise">Operation Chastise</a> on 16/17 May 1943. <a href="No.%20618%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 618 Squadron</a> was formed in April 1943 and equipped with <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>s to execute this attack, but trials of the "Highball" bouncing bombs during the year were unsuccessful and the plan was abandoned in September. "Tirpitz" was transferred to a new base at <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a> in the far north of Norway in late May 1943. This anchorage was well protected, with the defences including equipment capable of rapidly generating an artificial smokescreen as well as many anti-aircraft guns located in shore batteries and warships. During June 1943, consideration was given to attacking the battleship with <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> heavy bombers. These aircraft would have flown from the United Kingdom to Kaafjord, landed in the Soviet Union and made another attack against "Tirpitz" on their return flight. Such a mission was judged to be impractical by the RAF as it was expected that German fighter aircraft would heavily attack the bombers and Kaafjord would be covered by a smokescreen by the time they arrived over the target area. The only attack made against "Tirpitz" at Kaafjord by land-based aircraft prior to September 1944 was a small raid conducted by 15 Soviet bombers on the night of 10/11 February 1944, but it did not inflict any damage on the battleship.

The Royal Navy repeatedly attacked "Tirpitz" at Kaafjord from September 1943 until August 1944. On 23 September 1943, the crews of two British midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship during <a href="Operation%20Source">Operation Source</a>, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to "Tirpitz", putting her out of service for six months. Further midget submarine attacks were not considered feasible, and an air raid designated <a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a> was conducted by Royal Navy aircraft carriers on 3 April 1944 as repairs to the battleship neared completion. "Tirpitz" did not suffer heavy damage in this operation, but was out of action for several more months while repairs were completed. The Home Fleet sortied to attack Kaafjord on a further four occasions between April and July; all but the last of these operations were frustrated by bad weather, and the <a href="Operation%20Mascot">Operation Mascot</a> raid on 17 July did not inflict any damage on "Tirpitz". Four more carrier attacks targeting "Tirpitz" were undertaken between 22 and 29 August during <a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation Goodwood</a>, but again resulted in only minor damage to the battleship.

Senior Royal Navy officers attributed the failure of the raids conducted between April and August 1944 to shortcomings with the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm's</a> main attack aircraft, the <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a>. Although Operation Tungsten succeeded because the Germans were taken by surprise, during subsequent raids the slow speed of the Barracudas gave Kaafjord's defenders time to cover the area with artificial smoke before the British aircraft arrived over the target area. Moreover, the Barracudas were unable to carry bombs large enough to significantly damage "Tirpitz" when hits were achieved. As a result, before and after Operation Goodwood, further consideration was given to using Mosquitos to attack the battleship; under initial plans developed in mid-August these aircraft would have been launched from aircraft carriers and attacked "Tirpitz" with or armour-piercing bombs before landing in northern Russia. These proposals came to nothing as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, was unwilling to release any Mosquitos in July, and in August the Mosquitos were also judged to be too slow to successfully reach Kaafjord from aircraft carriers before it was covered by smoke.

In August <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>, which controlled the force's heavy bombers, began developing plans to strike "Tirpitz" at Kaafjord. During a meeting on 28 August between the head of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Harris%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Arthur Harris</a>, and Vice-Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Evill">Douglas Evill</a>, to discuss the feasibility of dispatching Mosquitos against Kaafjord, Harris stated that he had ready a plan to attack the battleship with Lancaster bombers. Under this plan, 24 Lancasters were to depart a base in the far north of Scotland, bomb "Tirpitz", and return to an airstrip in the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>. If the return trip was judged impossible, the bombers would instead land at <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> in northern Russia before returning to the United Kingdom. Bomber Command's staff had contacted Soviet officials about the latter element of the plan, and concluded that it would be feasible. Due to the complex nature of the mission, Bomber Command's two elite special duties units, <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 9</a> and <a href="No.%20617%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 617 Squadrons</a>, would conduct the attack. This proposal was viewed favourably, and was approved by Eisenhower's headquarters on 5 September.

<a href="No.%205%20Group%20RAF">No. 5 Group</a> was assigned responsibility for planning the attack on "Tirpitz" in late August. The group's staff officers judged that it was essential for the raid to surprise Kaafjord's defenders so that the battleship was not covered in smoke by the time the Lancasters arrived. As the seaward approaches to the fjord were covered by a comprehensive radar network, the planners decided that the attack force should approach the region overland from the south-east and at a high speed to limit the defenders' warning time to eight minutes or less. Due to the difficulty of damaging the heavily armoured battleship, the main weapon selected for this operation was the <a href="Tallboy%20%28bomb%29">Tallboy bomb</a>, the largest then in service with the RAF and capable of penetrating well-protected targets. Some of the bombers were to be armed with "Johnnie Walker" (commonly called "JW") <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a>, which were designed to be dropped from aircraft near ships and move through the water by rapidly diving and surfacing until they struck their target. Although the Tallboy had been successfully used by No. 617 Squadron against tunnels and other facilities, the mines had not been used in combat and Harris and several other senior RAF officers were sceptical of their effectiveness.
As test flights conducted by No. 617 Squadron proved that it was not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that it would be necessary for the aircraft to refuel in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and refuel at <a href="Yagodnik">Yagodnik</a> airstrip, which was located on an island near <a href="Arkhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a>. This plan was accepted by the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> on 6 September. <a href="Soviet%20Naval%20Aviation">Soviet Naval Aviation</a> offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested that Soviet aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.

The operation order setting out how the raid was to be conducted was issued by No. 5 Group on 7 September. It stated that Kaafjord was believed to be protected by 16 heavy and 16 light <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a>, as well as "Tirpitz"s guns, and that it took the defenders ten minutes to cover the battleship with a smokescreen. The attack force was to be organised into two groups. Force A, comprising twelve Lancasters from No. 9 Squadron and an equal number from No. 617 Squadron armed with a single Tallboy each, was to continue to Yagodnik after bombing. Force B was to comprise six Lancasters from each of the squadrons armed with twelve JW mines and return directly to either Scotland or the Shetland Islands. A Lancaster from the RAF Film Unit, which was attached to <a href="No.%20463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463 Squadron RAAF</a>, would accompany Force B and also return to the United Kingdom after the bombers completed their attack. It was intended that the attack would be conducted in daylight, and that the Lancasters would assemble into formations near Kaafjord before attacking. If the fjord was covered by cloud or smoke, Force A was ordered to not drop its valuable bombs and continue onto Yagodnik. Force B was directed to drop the JW mines regardless of cloud or smoke cover as long as an aiming point could be identified. The entire attack group was to maintain strict <a href="radio%20silence">radio silence</a>. Two <a href="No.%20511%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 511 Squadron</a> <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> transport aircraft were assigned to carry maintenance personnel and supplies from the United Kingdom to Yagodnik, and a Mosquito fitted for photo reconnaissance tasks from <a href="No.%20540%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 540 Squadron</a> would scout ahead of the attack force. All aircrew were briefed on this plan on either 8 or 9 September. Group Captain <a href="Colin%20McMullen">C.C. McMullen</a>, the commander of No. 9 Squadron's home base of <a href="RAF%20Bardney">RAF Bardney</a>, was appointed the overall leader of the detachment. No. 617 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander <a href="James%20Brian%20Tait">"Willy" Tait</a>, was selected to lead the strike force.

To provide weather reports and damage assessments from Kaafjord, agents on the ground were needed, but the last radio group in the area had <a href="Extraction%20%28military%29">exfiltrated</a> in May 1944. The first attempt at re-establishing a presence near "Tirpitz" occurred in August 1944, when a Norwegian <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> (SIS) agent was despatched to the nearby village of <a href="Alta%20%28town%29">Alta</a>. The agent infiltrated with a radio transmitter codenamed "Sinding" from <a href="Sweden%20during%20World%20War%20II">neutral Sweden</a>, but only managed to begin transmissions to the United Kingdom on 22 September, too late for the preparation stage for the operation. In a second attempt at establishing an agent group in the area, the Norwegian SIS agents <a href="Knut%20Moe">Knut Moe</a> and <a href="Anton%20Arild">Anton Arild</a> were dropped by parachute into the wilderness between Kaafjord and Alta on 8 September by an American <a href="Operation%20Carpetbagger">Operation Carpetbagger</a> Liberator. During the drop the agents became separated from most of their equipment, with the exception of the radio transmitter. Without weapons and equipment, the agents were forced to relocate to the village of <a href="Bossekop">Bossekop</a>, where Moe's mother lived. The radio transmitter operated by the SIS team, codenamed "Aslaug", was operational by 13 September, sending weather reports to the United Kingdom every other hour. As well as reporting on the weather, Moe and Arild radioed assessments of the damage "Tirpitz" had suffered in the air attacks prior to Operation Paravane. Local contacts helped the agents in spying on "Tirpitz" before and after the 15 September attack. By the time of the attack, Moe and Arild had established an <a href="observation%20post">observation post</a> overlooking "Tirpitz"s anchorage in Kaafjord.

The attack force was placed on alert to launch what had been designated Operation Paravane on 8 September. Good weather was vital for the operation, and the airmen waited at their home bases for the next two days as forecasts proved unfavourable. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry, No. 5 Group and British military liaison officers in the USSR continued to work with the relevant Soviet headquarters to finalise the arrangements for Force A's flight from Norway to Yagodnik.

Subsequent forecasts indicated that weather conditions at Kaafjord were changing rapidly, and during the morning of 11 September Harris judged that it would not be feasible to launch the bombers from Scotland with confidence that Kaafjord would be free of cloud by the time they arrived. Accordingly, he decided to change the plans for the operation, with all of the bombers now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets of the change in plans.

Both British bomber squadrons began to take off at 5pm local time. No. 9 Squadron dispatched 18 Lancasters from RAF Bardney and 20 No. 617 Squadron Lancasters departed from <a href="RAF%20Woodhall%20Spa">RAF Woodhall Spa</a>.
A total of 26 Lancasters were armed with Tallboys and the remainder with JW mines. The Film Unit Lancaster also flew out of Bardney carrying three RAF cameramen as well as an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> journalist and a radio reporter from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. The Liberators departed Bardney just before the bombers, carrying McMullen, maintenance personnel and spare parts. The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito left Bardney the next day. Despite not being notified of the new plan until after all of the Lancasters were airborne, the Soviet military quickly agreed to the changed arrangements.
The Lancasters' flight to Yagodnik initially went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew north to the Shetlands before turning east. During the early stages of the flight one of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was forced to dump its Tallboy into the North Sea after it became decoupled from its mounting; the bomber subsequently returned to base. The remaining aircraft passed over neutral Sweden where the aircrew, most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing <a href="Blackout%20%28wartime%29">blackouts</a>, were pleased to see towns lit up. After crossing the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a> the Lancasters continued over Finland towards the USSR. Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet anti-aircraft defences, but only one suffered any damage.

Despite pre-departure forecasts of good weather, the force encountered thick clouds after entering Finnish airspace; this continued for the remainder of the flight. The conditions made navigation difficult, and forced the pilots to fly at a low altitude so that they could use features on the ground to determine their location. Only 26 of the Lancasters were able to locate Yagodnik and land there during the morning of 12 September, the other 13 touching down at other airfields or crash landing in open spaces. Five or six of the later aircraft were written off, and two of the seven which eventually reached Yagodnik were too badly damaged to be used in operations. Despite the number of crashes, none of the airmen on board these aircraft were injured. McMullen recorded that it was "extraordinary that so few crashes occurred" given the adverse circumstances, and that the majority of the aircraft dispatched could have been destroyed.

After being concentrated at Yagodnik, the attack force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, but the process of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with <a href="Bed%20bug%20%28insect%29">bed bug</a>s, and almost all of the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.

By the morning of 14 September, 26 Lancasters from the attack forces and the Film Unit aircraft were ready; 20 of the bombers were armed with Tallboys and the remainder with JW mines. The Mosquito took off bound for Kaafjord at 2:10am, but the planned departure of the bombers at 8:00am was cancelled when it returned to Yagodnik at 6:45 and reported that conditions over the target area were unsuitable. For the remainder of the day the Soviets provided hospitality including a formal lunch, a <a href="Association%20football">football</a> tournament and a film that night. Some of the Allied airmen were disturbed to see <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s being beaten by overseers while undertaking forced labour. Work on repairing the damaged Lancasters also continued on 14 September, and an additional Tallboy-armed aircraft was ready by the next morning.

The plans for the raid were further adjusted while No. 9 and No. 617 Squadrons were waiting at Yagodnik. The Lancasters were to take off together, and fly at low altitude until they reached the border between Finland and the USSR to avoid detection by German radar stations located around <a href="Kirkenes">Kirkenes</a>. The Force A aircraft would then climb to around and the six Force B bombers to . Three Lancasters from No. 9 Squadron would proceed ahead of the main body to determine wind conditions over Kaafjord. When the main body reached a position around from the fjord, at which point the British expected that the Germans would have detected the bombers, the Lancasters would move into attack formations and commence their bombing run. It was decided that all of the aircraft should attack simultaneously, with Force A flying in four groups of five aircraft which would approach Kaafjord from the south and drop Tallboys from altitudes between and . Force B was to fly in two lines abreast, pass over the fjord from south-east to north-west, and release the JW mines from between and .

The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito reconnoitred Kaafjord again in the morning of 15 September, and at 7am Yagodnik time reported that conditions were suitable for an attack. The 27 bombers and Film Unit Lancaster began taking off shortly afterwards. The aircraft flew in a loose formation and the journey to northern Norway went as planned, though six Lancasters were forced to abort and return to Yagodnik. Despite passing near several German bases, the British force was undetected and no German fighters were airborne over Kaafjord at the time of the attack.

Kaafjord's defenders detected the Lancasters approximately ten minutes before they arrived, and the protective smokescreen was beginning to form when the attack commenced at 10:55am <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a>. Only the first group of Lancasters, led by Tait, were able to aim their bombs at "Tirpitz" before she was obscured by smoke. It is believed that the bomb dropped from Tait's aircraft struck the battleship, and the other bombs dropped by this group landed in the water nearby. All the other Force A aircraft aimed their Tallboys at the anti-aircraft gunfire rising from the ship; 17 of the weapons were dropped. Several Lancasters made more than one pass over the target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate "Tirpitz" or technical problems prevented their Tallboy from being dropped on the initial pass.

Force B commenced its attack after the Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs so that the shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot "Tirpitz" due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew from being able to assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. "Tirpitz"s anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.

All of the Lancasters had completed their attacks by 11:07am GMT, and the 21 bombers began the return journey to Yagodnik. The Force A aircraft which had not been able to bomb brought their Tallboys back. This flight proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening. The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.

The Mosquito conducted a reconnaissance sortie over Kaafjord on the afternoon of 15 September, arriving at about 1:30pm GMT. Its crew found that the fjord was covered with cloud and smoke. They could only briefly see "Tirpitz", but reported that no damage was evident to the battleship, which remained afloat. The Mosquito conducted further reconnaissance sorties on 16 September, but the fjord was completely obscured on all occasions. McMullen considered launching a second attack, but decided against doing so as only two Tallboys and one load of JW mines were available.

"Tirpitz" was rendered unfit for combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship passed through the <a href="Forecastle">foredeck</a> and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near "Tirpitz" also buckled some of her hull plates and <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, "Tirpitz"s commanding officer, <a href="Captain%20at%20sea">"Kapitän zur See"</a> <a href="Wolf%20Junge">Wolf Junge</a>, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.

The attack force returned to the United Kingdom in several groups. Tait led 16 Lancasters out of Yagodnik in the evening of 16 September; most of these aircraft flew over southern Finland, Sweden and Denmark. One of the Lancasters went off course and crashed on a mountain near <a href="Nesbyen">Nesbyen</a> in Norway, killing all eleven airmen aboard, the only Allied casualties of Operation Paravane. Nine other Lancasters departed on 17 September, followed by five the next day and two on 21 September. The remaining Lancasters had been judged to be damaged beyond repair, and were handed over to the Soviets. The Mosquito, which had been damaged by anti-aircraft fire during a sortie over Kaafjord, returned once repairs were complete on 26 September. The two Liberators were the final aircraft to depart, and flew out of Yagodnik carrying McMullen on 27 September.

Following the attack, the British intelligence services sought to determine the extent of "Tirpitz"s damage. During late September, Norwegian SIS agents in the Kaafjord area reported that the battleship had been struck by a bomb and appeared damaged. German radio signals that were intercepted and decoded on 25 and 29 September also stated that "Tirpitz" had suffered a single hit from a large bomb. Photographs taken by the No. 540 Squadron Mosquito and a Soviet aircraft on 20 September indicated that the bow of the ship was damaged, though it was not possible to determine how badly. Drawing on this evidence, the Royal Navy's Naval Intelligence Division concluded on 30 September that "Tirpitz" had "almost certainly" been struck by a Tallboy and may have been further damaged by near misses, and that the damage to the ship may have been "considerable" and rendered her unable to put to sea. A report from a Norwegian agent on 31 September was more specific, stating that "Tirpitz" had suffered a direct hit, which had opened a gash on her bow. Further agent reports in early October provided little new evidence. By late October, with no major German warships left in Kaafjord, the agents operating the "Aslaug" transmitter left the area, sending their last transmission to the United Kingdom on 22 October. Moe and Arild made their way on foot across the <a href="Finnmarksvidda">Finnmarksvidda</a> plateau to <a href="Kautokeino">Kautokeino</a> and from there through Finland to <a href="Karesuando">Karesuando</a> in Sweden, arriving on 5 December. The agents carried out the march without resupplies of food, as Operation Carpetbagger had ceased using Soviet airbases after a Liberator was inadvertently shot down by a Soviet fighter during a follow-up operation to <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> shortly after the insertion of Moe and Arild.

A meeting involving <a href="Grand%20admiral">"Großadmiral"</a> <a href="Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz">Karl Dönitz</a>, the commander of the German Navy, was held in Berlin on 23 September to discuss the damage to "Tirpitz". Dönitz was informed that it would take nine months to repair the ship, and that all the work had to be done at Kaafjord as the battleship would be extremely vulnerable if she tried to sail to a major port. As Soviet forces were also rapidly advancing towards northern Norway, Dönitz judged that it was not feasible to either return the ship to ocean-going service or retain her at Kaafjord. Instead, he decided to use "Tirpitz" as a floating <a href="artillery%20battery">artillery battery</a> to defend the town of <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>. Dönitz also expressed hope that retaining the ship in commission would "continue to tie down enemy forces and by her presence ... confound the enemies' intentions". The commander of the German Navy's task force in northern Norway, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" <a href="Rudolf%20Peters">Rudolf Peters</a>, was accordingly directed to anchor "Tirpitz" at a location near Tromsø where the water was shallow enough to prevent the battleship from sinking completely if she suffered further damage.

As the intelligence available to them was not conclusive, the Allies believed that "Tirpitz" still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was within the range of Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, <a href="Operation%20Obviate">Operation Obviate</a>, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, <a href="Operation%20Catechism">Operation Catechism</a>, "Tirpitz" was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.

Seattle

Seattle ( ) is a <a href="port">seaport</a> city on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a>. It is the <a href="county%20seat">seat</a> of <a href="King%20County%2C%20Washington">King County</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. With an estimated 730,000 residents , Seattle is the largest city in both the <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. According to <a href="United%20States%20Census">U.S. Census</a> data released in 2018, the <a href="Seattle%20metropolitan%20area">Seattle metropolitan area</a>’s population stands at 3.87 million, and ranks as the 15th largest in the United States. In July 2013, it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%. In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing major U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate. Seattle is the northernmost large city in the United States.

The city is situated on an <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a> between <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>, about south of the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–United States border</a>. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling .

The Seattle area was inhabited by <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. <a href="Arthur%20A.%20Denny">Arthur A. Denny</a> and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the <a href="Denny%20Party">Denny Party</a>, arrived from <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> via <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, on the <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Exact" at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of <a href="Elliott%20Bay">Elliott Bay</a> and named "Seattle" in 1852, in honor of <a href="Chief%20Seattle">Chief Si'ahl</a> of the local <a href="Duwamish%20people">Duwamish</a> and <a href="Suquamish">Suquamish</a> tribes. Today, Seattle has high populations of Native, <a href="Scandinavian%20Americans">Scandinavian</a>, <a href="African%20Americans">African</a>, and <a href="Asian%20Americans">Asian Americans</a>, as well as a <a href="LGBT%20culture%20in%20Seattle">thriving LGBT community</a> that ranks 6th in the United States for population.

<a href="Logging">Logging</a> was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> during the <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a>. Growth after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> was partially due to the local <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer <a href="Amazon%20%28company%29">Amazon</a> was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline <a href="Alaska%20Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> was founded in <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac, Washington</a>, serving Seattle's international airport, <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>. The stream of new software, <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Owing largely to its rapidly increasing population in the 21st century, Seattle and the state of Washington have some of the <a href="Minimum%20wage%20in%20the%20United%20States">highest minimum wages in the country</a>, at $15 per hour for smaller businesses and $16 for the city's largest employers.

Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen <a href="jazz">jazz</a> nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, <a href="Ernestine%20Anderson">Ernestine Anderson</a>, and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, as well as the origin of the bands <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a> and the <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> movement <a href="grunge">grunge</a>.

Archaeological excavations suggest that Native Americans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years. By the time the first European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the <a href="Duwamish%20tribe">Duwamish tribe</a>) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around <a href="Elliott%20Bay">Elliott Bay</a>.

The first European to visit the Seattle area was <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a>, in May 1792 during his <a href="Vancouver%20Expedition">1791–95 expedition</a> to chart the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>.
In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the <a href="Duwamish%20River">Duwamish River</a>; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on <a href="Alki%20Point%2C%20Seattle">Alki Point</a> on September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, Oregon, and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.

After a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day <a href="Pioneer%20Square%2C%20Seattle">Pioneer Square</a>, naming this new settlement "Duwamps".

Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it "New York," but renamed "New York Alki" in April 1853, from a <a href="Chinook%20Jargon">Chinook</a> word meaning, roughly, "by and by" or "someday."

For the next few years, New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.

<a href="David%20Swinson%20Maynard">David Swinson "Doc" Maynard</a>, one of the founders of Duwamps, was the primary advocate to name the settlement after <a href="Chief%20Seattle">Chief Seattle</a> ("Seattle") of the Duwamish and <a href="Suquamish">Suquamish</a> tribes.

The name "Seattle" appears on official <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a> papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first <a href="plat">plat</a>s for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a <a href="trustee%20model%20of%20representation">board of trustees</a> managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a <a href="mayor%E2%80%93council%20government">mayor–council government</a>. The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date "1869" and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile.

Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.
The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as <a href="Yesler%20Way">Yesler Way</a> won the nickname "Skid Road," supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to <a href="Henry%20Yesler">Henry Yesler</a>'s sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as "<a href="Skid%20Row">Skid Row</a>".) Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between <a href="working%20class">labor</a> and <a href="capitalism">management</a>, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the <a href="History%20of%20Seattle%20before%201900%23Relations%20between%20whites%20and%20Chinese">anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886</a>. This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.

Seattle had achieved sufficient economic success that when the <a href="Great%20Seattle%20Fire">Great Seattle Fire</a> of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place. Finance company <a href="Washington%20Mutual">Washington Mutual</a>, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire. However, the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> hit Seattle hard.

The second and most dramatic boom resulted from the <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a>, which ended the depression that had begun with the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the "S.S. Portland" docked with its famed "ton of gold," and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, <a href="Port%20Townsend%2C%20Washington">Port Townsend</a>, <a href="Bremerton%2C%20Washington">Bremerton</a>, and <a href="Olympia%2C%20Washington">Olympia</a>, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than <a href="mother%20lode">mother lode</a>s for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old <a href="James%20E.%20Casey">James E. Casey</a> borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the <a href="American%20Messenger%20Company">American Messenger Company</a> (later <a href="United%20Parcel%20Service">UPS</a>). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include <a href="Nordstrom">Nordstrom</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Bauer">Eddie Bauer</a>. Seattle brought in the <a href="Olmsted%20Brothers">Olmsted Brothers</a> landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.
The Gold Rush era culminated in the <a href="Alaska-Yukon-Pacific%20Exposition">Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition</a> of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> campus.

A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment led to the <a href="Seattle%20General%20Strike">Seattle General Strike of 1919</a>, the first <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in the country. A 1912 city development plan by <a href="Virgil%20Bogue">Virgil Bogue</a> went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the <a href="Maritime%20Strike%20of%201934">Maritime Strike of 1934</a> cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the <a href="Port%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Port of Los Angeles</a>.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the Asian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims of unemployment due to citizenship status.

Seattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">WPA</a>, <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">CCC</a>, UCL, and <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">PWA</a>. The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, but lost to LA as well. Seattle's eastern farm land faded due to <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>’s and the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>’s, forcing people into town.

The famous "<a href="Hooverville">Hooverville</a>" arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle's growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.

A movement by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>’s book "It’s Up to the Women", women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals "Working Woman" and "The Woman Today", women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.

Seattle's <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> was greatly affected during the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered during the time period. While <a href="Seattle%20Public%20Schools">Seattle public schools</a> were influenced by Washington's superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.

Seattle was also the home base of impresario <a href="Alexander%20Pantages">Alexander Pantages</a> who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival <a href="John%20Considine%20%28Seattle%29">John Considine</a>, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. <a href="B.%20Marcus%20Priteca">B. Marcus Priteca</a>, the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a>-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the "Pantages" name; Seattle's surviving <a href="Paramount%20Theatre%20%28Seattle%29">Paramount Theatre</a>, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the <a href="Japanese%20American%20internment">Japanese American internment</a>. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial <a href="airliner">airliner</a> market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the <a href="Century%2021%20Exposition">Century 21 Exposition</a>, the <a href="Century%2021%20Exposition">1962 World's Fair</a>. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the <a href="1970s%20energy%20crisis">oil crises</a>, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747</a>. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading "Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights."

Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's <a href="Boeing%20Renton%20Factory">Renton narrow-body plant</a> (where the <a href="Boeing%20707">707</a>, <a href="Boeing%20720">720</a>, <a href="Boeing%20727">727</a>, and <a href="Boeing%20757">757</a> were assembled, and the <a href="Boeing%20737">737</a> is assembled today) and <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">Everett wide-body plant</a> (assembly plant for the <a href="Boeing%20747">747</a>, <a href="Boeing%20767">767</a>, <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a>, and <a href="Boeing%20787">787</a>). The company's <a href="credit%20union">credit union</a> for employees, <a href="BECU">BECU</a>, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.

As prosperity began to return in the 1980s, the city was stunned by the <a href="Wah%20Mee%20massacre">Wah Mee massacre</a> in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the <a href="Seattle%20Chinatown-International%20District">Seattle Chinatown-International District</a>. Beginning with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s 1979 move from <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque</a>, New Mexico, to nearby <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue, Washington</a>, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="F5%20Networks">F5 Networks</a>, <a href="RealNetworks">RealNetworks</a>, <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Mobility">AT&T Mobility</a>), VoiceStream (now <a href="T-Mobile%20US">T-Mobile</a>), and <a href="biomedical">biomedical</a> corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by <a href="Philips">Philips</a>), Heart Technologies (later purchased by <a href="Boston%20Scientific">Boston Scientific</a>), Physio-Control (later purchased by <a href="Medtronic">Medtronic</a>), <a href="ZymoGenetics">ZymoGenetics</a>, ICOS (later purchased by <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company">Eli Lilly and Company</a>) and Immunex (later purchased by <a href="Amgen">Amgen</a>). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie "<a href="Sleepless%20in%20Seattle">Sleepless in Seattle</a>" brought the city further national attention.The <a href="dot-com%20bubble">dot-com boom</a> caused a great frenzy among the technology companies in Seattle but the bubble ended in early 2001.

Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 <a href="Goodwill%20Games">Goodwill Games</a> and the <a href="APEC">APEC</a> leaders conference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of <a href="grunge">grunge</a>, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999">World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999</a>—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999%20protest%20activity">related protest activity</a> and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the <a href="Seattle%20Mardi%20Gras%20Riots">Mardi Gras Riots</a> in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the <a href="2001%20Nisqually%20earthquake">Nisqually earthquake</a>.
Another boom began as the city emerged from the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a> which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Beacon Hill</a> to <a href="South%20Lake%20Union%2C%20Seattle">South Lake Union</a>. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent. The city has found itself "bursting at the seams", with over 45,000 households spending more than half their income on housing and <a href="Homelessness%20in%20Seattle">at least 2,800 people homeless</a>, and with the country's sixth-worst rush hour traffic.
With a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3 km²), Seattle is the northernmost city with at least 500,000 people in the United States, farther north than Canadian cities such as <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, and at about the same latitude as <a href="Salzburg%2C%20Austria">Salzburg, Austria</a>.

The topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound, while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city has over of parkland.

Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the <a href="Kitsap%20Peninsula">Kitsap Peninsula</a> and <a href="Olympic%20Mountains">Olympic Mountains</a> on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the <a href="Eastside%20%28King%20County%2C%20Washington%29">Eastside</a> suburbs, are <a href="Lake%20Sammamish">Lake Sammamish</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the <a href="Lake%20Washington%20Ship%20Canal">Lake Washington Ship Canal</a> (consisting of two man-made canals, <a href="Lake%20Union">Lake Union</a>, and the <a href="Hiram%20M.%20Chittenden%20Locks">Hiram M. Chittenden Locks</a> at <a href="Salmon%20Bay">Salmon Bay</a>, ending in <a href="Shilshole%20Bay">Shilshole Bay</a> on Puget Sound).

The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.

The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on <a href="Seven%20hills%20of%20Seattle">seven hills</a>; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many <a href="Regrading%20in%20Seattle">regrading projects</a> that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial <a href="Duwamish%20Waterway">Duwamish Waterway</a>, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at <a href="High%20Point%2C%20Seattle">High Point</a> in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.

North of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: <a href="Lake%20Union">Lake Union</a>, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and <a href="Union%20Bay%20%28Seattle%29">Union Bay</a>.

Due to its location in the <a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude 6.8</a> <a href="2001%20Nisqually%20earthquake">Nisqually earthquake</a> did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on <a href="land%20reclamation">reclaimed land</a>, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), but caused only one fatality.
Other strong quakes occurred on <a href="1700%20Cascadia%20earthquake">January 26, 1700</a> (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), <a href="1949%20Olympia%20earthquake">April 13, 1949</a> (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The <a href="1965%20Puget%20Sound%20earthquake">1965 quake</a> caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the <a href="Seattle%20Fault">Seattle Fault</a> passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the <a href="Cascadia%20subduction%20zone">Cascadia subduction zone</a> has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , water (41.16% of the total area).

Seattle has a warm-temperate climate, exhibiting strong characteristics of both an <a href="Oceanic%20climate">Oceanic climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a>: "Cfb"), and a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a>: "Csb"). It has cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers, covering characteristics of both. The climate is sometimes characterized as a "modified Mediterranean" climate because it is cooler and wetter than a "true" Mediterranean climate, but shares the characteristic dry summer (which has a strong influence on the region's vegetation). The city and environs are part of <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">USDA</a> <a href="hardiness%20zone">hardiness zone</a> 8b, with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a.

Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>, greater <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about ). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite having a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other U.S. cities like Chicago or New York City. However, unlike many other U.S. cities, Seattle has many more "rain days", when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days.
In an average year, at least of precipitation falls on 150 days, more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days. Official weather and climatic data is collected at <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>, located about south of downtown in the city of <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a>, which is at a higher elevation, and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year.

Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes of the Cascades, while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the <a href="Fraser%20Valley">Fraser Valley</a> in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>.

From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a> was 37.49 inches (952 mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from in 1952 to in 1950; for water year (October 1 – September 30) precipitation, the range is in 1976–77 to in 1996–97. Due to local variations in <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a>, Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around to the west, the <a href="Hoh%20Rain%20Forest">Hoh Rain Forest</a> in <a href="Olympic%20National%20Park">Olympic National Park</a> on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of . Sixty miles (95 km) to the south of Seattle, the state capital <a href="Olympia%2C%20Washington">Olympia</a>, which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain shadow, receives an annual average precipitation of . The city of <a href="Bremerton%2C%20Washington">Bremerton</a>, about west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives of precipitation annually.

Conversely, the northeastern portion of the <a href="Olympic%20Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a>, which lies east of the <a href="Olympic%20Mountains">Olympic Mountains</a> is located within the Olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains, it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer, and significantly dryer air. <a href="Sequim%2C%20Washington">Sequim, Washington</a>, nicknamed "Sunny Sequim," is located approximately northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just of annual precipitation, more comparable to that of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Often an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> to the north and east of Sequim. On average Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include <a href="Port%20Angeles%2C%20Washington">Port Angeles</a>, <a href="Port%20Townsend%2C%20Washington">Port Townsend</a>, extending as far north as <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria, British Columbia</a>.

In November, Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">lower 48 states</a>, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio, and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, <a href="Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Fort Myers, Florida</a>, reports thunder on 93 days per year, <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a> on 52, and New York City on 25.

Seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during November, December, and January, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as "<a href="Pineapple%20Express">Pineapple Express</a>" systems), strong frontal systems, and Pacific low-pressure systems are common. Light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on average, less than of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is less common. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such event occurred on December 2–4, 2007, when sustained <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation totals exceeded in some areas with winds topping out at along coastal Oregon. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period. Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.

Autumn, winter, and early spring are frequently characterized by rain. Winters are cool and wet with December, the coolest month, averaging , with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark, and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day; the temperature rarely lowers to . Summers are sunny, dry and warm, with August, the warmest month, with high temperatures averaging , and reaching on 3.1 days per year. In 2015 the city recorded 13 days over 90 °F. The hottest officially recorded temperature was on July 29, 2009; the coldest recorded temperature was on January 31, 1950; the record cold daily maximum is on January 14, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is the day the official record high was set. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 16 through March 10, allowing a growing season of 250 days.
Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport, is . Single calendar-day snowfall of six inches (15 cm) or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948, and only once since February 17, 1990, when of snow officially fell at Sea-Tac airport on January 18, 2012. This moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest since November 1985. Much of the city of Seattle proper received somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations. Locations to the south of Seattle received more, with Olympia and Chehalis receiving . Another moderate snow event occurred from December 12–25, 2008, when over one foot (30 cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks, when temperatures remained below , causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow. The largest documented <a href="Snow-storm">snowstorm</a> occurred from January 5–9, 1880, with snow drifting to in places at the end of the snow event. From January 31 to February 2, 1916, another heavy snow event occurred with of snow on the ground by the time the event was over. With official records dating to 1948, the largest single-day snowfall is on January 13, 1950. Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991–92 to in 1968–69, with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009–10. The month of January 1950 was particularly severe, bringing of snow, the most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold.

The <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Convergence%20Zone">Puget Sound Convergence Zone</a> is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in <a href="convection">convection</a>. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The <a href="Hanukkah%20Eve%20Wind%20Storm%20of%202006">Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm</a> in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.

One of many exceptions to Seattle's reputation as a damp location occurs in <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> years, when marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.

According to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the racial makeup of the city was 65.7% <a href="White%20American">Caucasian</a>, 14.1% <a href="Asian%20American">Asian</a>, 7.0% <a href="African%20American">of African origin</a>,
6.6% <a href="Hispanics%20in%20the%20United%20States">Hispanic</a> or <a href="Latino">Latino</a> of any race, 0.4% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>, 0.9% <a href="Pacific%20Islander%20American">Pacific Islander</a>, 0.2% other races, and 5.6% <a href="Multiracial%20American">two or more races</a>.

According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>, Seattle had a population of 608,660 with a racial and ethnic composition as follows:

Seattle's population historically has been predominantly white. The 2010 census showed that Seattle was one of the whitest big cities in the country, although its proportion of white residents has been gradually declining. In 1960, whites comprised 91.6% of the city's population, while in 2010 they comprised 69.5%. According to the 2006–2008 <a href="American%20Community%20Survey">American Community Survey</a>, approximately 78.9% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Those who spoke <a href="Languages%20of%20Asia">Asian languages</a> other than Indo-European languages made up 10.2% of the population, Spanish was spoken by 4.5% of the population, speakers of other <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a> made up 3.9%, and speakers of other languages made up 2.5%.

Seattle's foreign-born population grew 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The <a href="Chinese%20American">Chinese</a> population in the Seattle area has origins in <a href="mainland%20China">mainland China</a>, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from <a href="Guangdong%20Province">Guangdong Province</a>. The Seattle area is also home to a large <a href="Vietnamese%20American">Vietnamese</a> population of more than 55,000 residents, as well as over 30,000 <a href="Somali%20American">Somali</a> immigrants. The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest <a href="Cambodian%20American">Cambodian</a> communities in the United States, numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans, and one of the largest <a href="Samoan%20American">Samoan</a> communities in the mainland U.S., with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry. Additionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau. According to a 2012 <a href="HistoryLink">HistoryLink</a> study, Seattle's 98118 ZIP code (in the Columbia City neighborhood) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States.

According to a 2014 study by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a>, the largest religious groupings are <a href="Christianity">Christians</a> (52%), followed by those of <a href="Irreligion">no religion</a> (37%), <a href="Hinduism">Hindus</a> (2%), <a href="Buddhism">Buddhists</a> (2%), <a href="Judaism">Jews</a> (1%), <a href="Islam">Muslims</a> (1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings. According to the same study by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a>, about 34% of Seattleites are <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>, and 15% professing <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> beliefs. Meanwhile, 6% of the residents in Seattle call themselves <a href="agnostics">agnostics</a>, while 10% call themselves <a href="atheists">atheists</a>.

In 1999, the median income of a city household was $45,736, and the median income for a family was $62,195. Males had a median income of $40,929 versus $35,134 for females. The per capita income for the city was $30,306. 11.8% of the population and 6.9% of families are below the poverty line. Of people living in poverty, 13.8% are under the age of 18 and 10.2% are 65 or older.

It is estimated that King County has 8,000 homeless people on any given night, and many of those live in Seattle. In September 2005, King County adopted a "Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness", one of the near-term results of which is a shift of funding from <a href="homeless%20shelter">homeless shelter</a> beds to permanent housing.

In recent years, the city has experienced steady population growth, and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.

Seattle also has large <a href="LGBT">lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender</a> populations. According to a 2006 study by <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>, 12.9% of city residents polled identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. This was the second-highest proportion of any major U.S. city, behind <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Greater Seattle also ranked second among major U.S. metropolitan areas, with 6.5% of the population identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. According to 2012 estimates from the United States Census Bureau, Seattle has the highest percentage of same-sex households in the United States, at 2.6 per cent, surpassing San Francisco.

In addition, Seattle has a relatively high number of people living alone. According to the 2000 U.S. Census interim measurements of 2004, Seattle has the fifth highest proportion of single-person households nationwide among cities of 100,000 or more residents, at 40.8%.

Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies, and "new economy" Internet and technology companies, service, design, and clean technology companies. The city's gross metropolitan product (GMP) was $231 billion in 2010, making it the <a href="List%20of%20metropolitan%20areas%20in%20the%20United%20States%20by%20GMP">11th largest metropolitan economy</a> in the United States. The <a href="Port%20of%20Seattle">Port of Seattle</a>, which also operates <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>, is a major gateway for trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska. It also is the 8th largest port in the United States when measured by container capacity. Its maritime cargo operations merged with the <a href="Port%20of%20Tacoma">Port of Tacoma</a> in 2015 to form the <a href="Northwest%20Seaport%20Alliance">Northwest Seaport Alliance</a>. Although it was affected by the <a href="Great%20Recession%20in%20the%20United%20States">Great Recession</a>, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy. It even remains as a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies. It was ranked as America's No. 1 "smarter city" based on its government policies and green economy. In February 2010, the city government committed Seattle to become North America's first "climate neutral" city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
Large companies continue to dominate the business landscape. Five companies on <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a>'s 2017 list of the United States' largest companies (based on total revenue) are headquartered in Seattle: Internet retailer <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> (#12), coffee chain <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> (#131), department store <a href="Nordstrom">Nordstrom</a> (#188), freight forwarder <a href="Expeditors%20International%20of%20Washington">Expeditors International of Washington</a> (#429) and forest products company <a href="Weyerhaeuser">Weyerhaeuser</a> (#341). Other Fortune 500 companies commonly associated with Seattle are based in nearby Puget Sound cities. Warehouse club chain <a href="Costco">Costco</a> (#16), the largest retail company in Washington, is based in <a href="Issaquah%2C%20Washington">Issaquah</a>. <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> (#28) is located in <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a>. Furthermore, Bellevue is home to truck manufacturer <a href="Paccar">Paccar</a> (#164).

The city has a reputation for heavy <a href="Coffee%20in%20Seattle">coffee consumption</a>; coffee companies founded or based in Seattle include Starbucks, <a href="Seattle%27s%20Best%20Coffee">Seattle's Best Coffee</a>, and <a href="Tully%27s%20Coffee">Tully's</a>. There are also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and cafés.

Before moving its headquarters to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> (#24) was the largest company based in Seattle. Its largest division, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is still headquartered in nearby Renton. The company also has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton; it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. In 2006 former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> industry. Major redevelopment of the <a href="South%20Lake%20Union%2C%20Seattle">South Lake Union</a> neighborhood is underway in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies <a href="Corixa%20%28company%29">Corixa</a> (acquired by <a href="GlaxoSmithKline">GlaxoSmithKline</a>), Immunex (now part of Amgen), <a href="Trubion">Trubion</a>, and ZymoGenetics. <a href="Vulcan%20Inc.">Vulcan Inc.</a>, the holding company of billionaire <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a>, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the <a href="Seattle%20City%20Council">Seattle City Council</a> for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, "Expansion Magazine" ranked Seattle as one of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation based on climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.

Operating a hub at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, <a href="Alaska%20Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> maintains its headquarters in the city of <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a>, next to the airport.

Seattle is a hub for global health with the headquarters of the <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, PATH, <a href="Infectious%20Disease%20Research%20Institute">Infectious Disease Research Institute</a>, <a href="Fred%20Hutchinson%20Cancer%20Research%20Center">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a>, and the <a href="Institute%20for%20Health%20Metrics%20and%20Evaluation">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a>. In 2015, the Washington Global Health Alliance counted 168 global health organizations in Washington state. Many are headquartered in Seattle. 

Twenty of <a href="List%20of%20Seattle%20street%20fairs%20and%20parades">Seattle's neighborhoods</a> host one or more street fairs or parades.

From 1869 until 1982, Seattle was known as the "Queen City". Seattle's official nickname is the "Emerald City", the result of a contest held in 1981; the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the "Gateway to Alaska" for being the nearest major city in the contiguous U.S. to Alaska, "Rain City" for its frequent cloudy and rainy weather, and "Jet City" from the local influence of Boeing. The city has two official slogans or mottos: "The City of Flowers", meant to encourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city, and "The City of Goodwill", adopted prior to the <a href="1990%20Goodwill%20Games">1990 Goodwill Games</a>. Seattle residents are known as "<a href="List%20of%20people%20from%20Seattle">Seattleites</a>".

Seattle has been a regional center for the <a href="performing%20arts">performing arts</a> for many years.

Seattle is widely considered one of the most socially liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing Portland. In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> in the state. Like much of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> (which has the lowest rate of <a href="church%20attendance">church attendance</a> in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of <a href="atheism">atheism</a>), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.

Seattle also has a thriving alternative press, with the Web-based daily "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>", several other online dailies (including "Publicola" and "<a href="Crosscut.com">Crosscut</a>"), "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%28newspaper%29">The Stranger</a>" (an alternative, left-leaning weekly), "<a href="Seattle%20Weekly">Seattle Weekly</a>", and a number of issue-focused publications, including the nation's two largest online environmental magazines, "<a href="Worldchanging">Worldchanging</a>" and "<a href="Grist.org">Grist.org</a>".

In July 2012, Seattle banned <a href="plastic%20shopping%20bag">plastic shopping bag</a>s. In June 2014 the city passed a <a href="local%20ordinance">local ordinance</a> to increase the <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> to $15 an hour on a staged basis from 2015 to 2021. When fully implemented the $15 hourly rate will be the highest minimum wage in the nation.

On October 6, 2014, Seattle officially replaced Columbus Day with <a href="Indigenous%20Peoples%27%20Day">Indigenous Peoples' Day</a>, honoring Seattle's Native American community and acknowledging the controversies surrounding the legacy of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>.

On May 9, 2017, Mayor Murray announced he would not seek re-election following a lawsuit alleging <a href="sexual%20abuse">sexual abuse</a> of several teenaged boys in the 1980s. Murray resigned as mayor on September 12, 2017, effective at 5p.m. on September 13, 2017, hours after <a href="Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a> reported a fifth allegation of <a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">child sexual abuse</a>.

In July 2017, the <a href="Seattle%20City%20Council">Seattle City Council</a> unanimously approved an income tax on Seattle residents, making the city the only one in the state with an income tax. The new income tax was ruled unconstitutional in a ruling by King County Superior Court and thus was not allowed to proceed. The city is expected to appeal this ruling.

Of the city's population over the age of 25, 53.8% (vs. a national average of 27.4%) hold a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> or higher, and 91.9% (vs. 84.5% nationally) have a high school diploma or <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">equivalent</a>. A 2008 United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U.S. city. The city was listed as the most literate of the country's 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006, the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by <a href="Central%20Connecticut%20State%20University">Central Connecticut State University</a>.

<a href="Seattle%20Public%20Schools">Seattle Public Schools</a> desegregated without a court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In 2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a>, but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators (e.g., income or socioeconomic class).

The public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools: Five of the private high schools are <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, one is <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>, and six are <a href="secular">secular</a>.

Seattle is home to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>, as well as the institution's professional and continuing education unit, the <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20Educational%20Outreach">University of Washington Educational Outreach</a>. The 2017 U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Washington at #11 in the world, tied with Johns Hopkins University. The UW receives more federal research and development funding than any public institution. Over the last 10 years, it has also produced more Peace Corps volunteers than any other U.S. university. Seattle also has a number of smaller private universities including <a href="Seattle%20University">Seattle University</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Pacific%20University">Seattle Pacific University</a>, the former a Jesuit Catholic institution, the latter Free Methodist; universities aimed at the working adult, like <a href="City%20University%20of%20Seattle">City University</a> and <a href="Antioch%20University">Antioch University</a>; colleges within the <a href="Seattle%20Colleges%20District">Seattle Colleges District</a> system, comprising <a href="North%20Seattle%20College">North</a>, <a href="Seattle%20Central%20College">Central</a>, and <a href="South%20Seattle%20College">South</a>; seminaries, including <a href="Western%20Seminary">Western Seminary</a> and a number of arts colleges, such as <a href="Cornish%20College%20of%20the%20Arts">Cornish College of the Arts</a>, <a href="Pratt%20Fine%20Arts%20Center">Pratt Fine Arts Center</a>, and <a href="The%20Art%20Institute%20of%20Seattle">The Art Institute of Seattle</a>. In 2001, "Time" magazine selected Seattle Central Community College as community college of the year, stating the school "pushes diverse students to work together in small teams".

, Seattle has one major daily newspaper, "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>". The "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>", known as the "P-I", published a daily newspaper from 1863 to March 17, 2009, before switching to a strictly on-line publication. There is also the "<a href="Seattle%20Daily%20Journal%20of%20Commerce">Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce</a>", and the University of Washington publishes "<a href="The%20Daily%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Washington">The Daily</a>", a student-run publication, when school is in session.

Seattle-based online magazines <a href="Worldchanging">Worldchanging</a> and <a href="Grist%20%28magazine%29">Grist.org</a> were two of the "Top Green Websites" in 2007 according to TIME.

Seattle also has many online news media websites. The two largest are "The Seattle Times" and the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer".

The University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits for programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern paramedic services with the establishment of <a href="Medic%20One">Medic One</a> in 1970. In 1974, a "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" story on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle "the best place in the world to have a heart attack".

Three of Seattle's largest medical centers are located on First Hill. <a href="Harborview%20Medical%20Center">Harborview Medical Center</a>, the public county hospital, is the only Level I <a href="trauma%20center">trauma hospital</a> in a region that includes Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. <a href="Virginia%20Mason%20Medical%20Center">Virginia Mason Medical Center</a> and <a href="Swedish%20Medical%20Center">Swedish Medical Center</a>'s two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle, including the <a href="Virginia%20Mason%20Hospital">Virginia Mason Hospital</a>. This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname "Pill Hill".

Located in the <a href="Laurelhurst%2C%20Seattle">Laurelhurst</a> neighborhood, <a href="Seattle%20Children%27s">Seattle Children's</a>, formerly <a href="Children%27s%20Hospital%20and%20Regional%20Medical%20Center">Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center</a>, is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The <a href="Fred%20Hutchinson%20Cancer%20Research%20Center">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a> has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood. The University District is home to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20Medical%20Center">University of Washington Medical Center</a> which, along with Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs">Veterans Affairs</a> hospital on <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Beacon Hill</a>, a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and <a href="Northwest%20Hospital%20and%20Medical%20Center">Northwest Hospital and Medical Center</a> near <a href="Northgate%20Mall%20%28Seattle%29">Northgate Mall</a>.

The <a href="Seattle%20Street%20Railway">first streetcars</a> appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the <a href="Trolleybuses%20in%20Seattle">Seattle trolleybus system</a> brought the end of <a href="Seattle%20Street%20Railway">streetcars in Seattle</a> in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.
<a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county, as well as the <a href="South%20Lake%20Union%20Streetcar">South Lake Union Streetcar</a> line and the <a href="First%20Hill%20Streetcar">First Hill Streetcar</a> line. Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a> provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area, two <a href="Sounder%20commuter%20rail">Sounder commuter rail</a> lines between the suburbs and downtown, and its <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a> <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> line between the University of Washington and Angle Lake. <a href="Washington%20State%20Ferries">Washington State Ferries</a>, which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to <a href="Bainbridge%20Island%2C%20Washington">Bainbridge</a> and <a href="Vashon%2C%20Washington">Vashon Islands</a> in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and <a href="Southworth%2C%20Washington">Southworth</a> on the Kitsap Peninsula.
According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line. The city has also been described by <a href="Bert%20Sperling">Bert Sperling</a> as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by <a href="Walk%20Score">Walk Score</a> as the sixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.

<a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>, locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac, is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world. Closer to downtown, <a href="Boeing%20Field">Boeing Field</a> is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners. A secondary passenger airport, <a href="Paine%20Field">Paine Field</a>, opened in 2019 and is located in <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, north of Seattle. It is predominently used for Boeing, which has a <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">large assembly plant</a> nearby.
The main mode of transportation, however, relies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s <a href="grid%20plan">grid pattern</a>, except in the central business district where early city leaders <a href="Arthur%20A.%20Denny">Arthur Denny</a> and <a href="Carson%20Boren">Carson Boren</a> insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North. Only two roads, <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> and <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%2099">State Route 99</a> (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the <a href="Alaskan%20Way%20Viaduct">Alaskan Way Viaduct</a>, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The <a href="Alaskan%20Way%20Viaduct%20replacement%20tunnel">Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel</a> was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed "Bertha" and is in diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to fall 2018 (with tolling set to begin in 2019). Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities, and is 10th among all North American cities.

The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> lines called <a href="RapidRide">RapidRide</a>. After rejecting a <a href="Roads%20and%20Transit">roads and transit measure</a> in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the <a href="Link%20light%20rail">Link light rail</a> system, and expand and improve <a href="Sounder%20commuter%20rail">Sounder commuter rail</a> service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach <a href="Northgate%2C%20Seattle">Northgate</a> and <a href="Lynnwood%2C%20Washington">Lynnwood</a> to the north, <a href="Federal%20Way%2C%20Washington">Federal Way</a> to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2024. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.

Water and electric power are municipal services, provided by <a href="Seattle%20Public%20Utilities">Seattle Public Utilities</a> and <a href="Seattle%20City%20Light">Seattle City Light</a> respectively. Other utility companies serving Seattle include <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Energy">Puget Sound Energy</a> (natural gas, electricity); <a href="Seattle%20Steam%20Company">Seattle Steam Company</a> (steam); <a href="Waste%20Management%2C%20Inc">Waste Management, Inc</a> and CleanScapes, Inc.

Delichon

Delichon is a small <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a>s that belongs to the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family and contains three <a href="species">species</a> named as house martins. These are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, blackish-blue above with a contrasting white rump, and with white or grey underparts. They have feathering on the toes and <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsi</a> that is characteristic of this genus. The house martins are closely related to other swallows that build mud <a href="bird%20nest">nests</a>, particularly the "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>" barn swallows. They breed only in Europe, Asia and the mountains of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. Two species, the <a href="Common%20house%20martin">common</a> and <a href="Asian%20house%20martin">Asian house martin</a>s, <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> south in winter, while the <a href="Nepal%20house%20martin">Nepal house martin</a> is resident in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> year-round.

The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, constructing feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is two or three white <a href="bird%20egg">eggs</a>; both parents build the nest, <a href="avian%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs and feed the chicks. These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as <a href="fly">flies</a> and <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s. Despite their flying skills the "Delichon" martins are sometimes caught by fast-flying <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>. They may carry <a href="flea">flea</a>s or internal <a href="parasitism">parasite</a>s. None of the species are considered <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a>, although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, lack of mud for nest building and competition with <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>s for nest sites.

The three "Delichon" species are members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae subfamily which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a>s. <a href="DNA">DNA</a> studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the "core martins" including burrowing species like the <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>, the "nest-adopters", which are birds like the <a href="tree%20swallow">tree swallow</a> that utilise natural cavities, and the "mud nest builders". The "Delichon" species construct a closed mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; they appear to be intermediate between the "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>" and "<a href="Ptyonoprogne">Ptyonoprogne</a>" species that make open cup nests, and the "<a href="Cecropis">Cecropis</a>" and "<a href="Petrochelidon">Petrochelidon</a>" swallows, which have <a href="retort">retort-like</a> closed nests with an entrance tunnel. The genetic evidence suggests a close relationship between "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>" and "Delichon", which is further supported by the frequency of <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">interbreeding</a> between two widespread species, the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a> and the common house martin, despite being their being in different genera. The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud-building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees.

The genus "Delichon" was created by American naturalist <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> and British <a href="entomology">entomologist</a> <a href="Frederic%20Moore">Frederic Moore</a> in 1854 to accommodate the Nepal house martin that was first described by Moore in the same year, and is therefore the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> for the genus. The two other house martins were moved to "Delichon" from the genus "Chelidon" in which they had been placed up to that time. The name of the new genus, ""Delichon"", is an <a href="anagram">anagram</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> term χελιδον/"chelidôn", meaning swallow.

The genus contains three similar species:


The common and Asian house martins have sometimes been considered to be a single species, although both breed in the western <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> without <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridising</a>. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> between these two martins.

"Delichon" is an <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> genus with all three species breeding only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern <a href="temperateness">temperate</a> Asia to <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka</a>. Its western subspecies "D. u. urbicum" winters in tropical Africa, and eastern "D. u. lagopodum" moves to southern China and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin in the mountains of central and eastern Asia; its <a href="Subspecies%23Nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> winters in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.

The preferred habitat of the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it is also found in mountains up to at least 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.

"Delichon" martins are 13–15 cm (5–6 in) long, blackish blue above with a contrasting white rump, and with white or grey underparts. They are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, and have feathering on the toes and <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsi</a>. The common house martin is the largest bird of the three, with an average weight of 18.3 g (0.65 oz), and has the most deeply forked tail; the Nepalese species is the smallest (15 g, 0.53 oz) and has the squarest tail. Distinctive species <a href="plumage">plumage</a> features are the black chin and black undertail <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a> of the Nepal house martin, and the greyish wash to the underparts of the Asian house martin. As with other swallows and martins, the <a href="moulting">moult</a> is slow and protracted because of the need to maintain efficient flight at all times to enable feeding. Moult normally starts on arrival at the wintering grounds, but overlaps with the breeding season for the non-migratory Nepal house martin.

The "Delichon" martins have simple flight calls of one to three notes. In the two more widespread species these have a distinctive buzzing quality. The male's song is a short simple ripple, perhaps less musical than that given by other swallows.

As a group, the house martins cannot easily be confused with any other swallows. Four species of the genus "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>" have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.

The "Delichon" martins were originally cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, to a lesser extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave the top of the nest open.

David Winkler and <a href="Fred%20Sheldon%20%28ornithologist%29">Frederick Sheldon</a> believe that evolutionary development in the mud-building swallows, and individual species follow this order of construction. A retort builder like <a href="red-rumped%20swallow">red-rumped swallow</a> starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. Winkler and Sheldon propose that the development of closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the "Delichon" martins.

The urban common house martin has to compete with house sparrows, which frequently attempt to take over the nest during construction, with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if the sparrows are successful. The entrance at the top of the completed cup is so small that the sparrows cannot take over the nest once it is finished.

As with other swallows, pairing and copulation displays are normally brief, taking just a few minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> and all three species are frequently <a href="avian%20incubation">double-brooded</a>. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does most of the incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.

A Scottish study showed that mortality in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%. Females that had raised two clutches in a season had a higher mortality than those that were single-brooded, but there was no such correlation for the males.

The "Delichon" species typically feed higher in the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="aphis">aphids</a> and <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a> such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="Neuroptera">lacewing</a>s. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial <a href="springtail">springtail</a>s and <a href="larva">larva</a>e and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like <a href="swift">swift</a>s, or other <a href="swallow">hirundines</a> such as the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn</a> or <a href="striated%20swallow">striated swallow</a>s. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears to be linked to the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.

The main predators of the house martins are those birds of prey which are capable of catching these agile fliers, such as the <a href="Eurasian%20hobby">hobby</a> ("<a href="Eurasian%20hobby">Falco subbuteo</a>"). Birds of the "Delichon" species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, with a group of these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous <a href="collared%20falconet">collared falconet</a> has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.

The house martins are parasitised by <a href="flea">flea</a>s and <a href="mite">mite</a>s, including the "house martin flea", "Ceratophyllus hirundinis" and its relatives. A Polish study of the common house martin showed that nests typically contained more than 29 species of ectoparasite, with "C. hirundinis" and another swallow specialist, "Oeciacus hirundinis", the most abundant. The genus also hosts <a href="parasitism">endoparasites</a> such as "Haemoproteus prognei" (<a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a>), which are transmitted by blood-sucking insects including mosquitoes.

More than 40 beetle species have been recorded in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>). The beetles have no effect on the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) is the organisation responsible for assessing the <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat if it has a small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). None of the three "Delichon" species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

The numbers of the two Asian species are unknown, but both can be locally common or abundant, and the Asian house martin is extending its range in southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. The lowland breeding common house martin has greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large numbers of the common house martin mean that its global status is secure.

White-eyed river martin

The white-eyed river martin ("Pseudochelidon sirintarae") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a>, one of only two members of the <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a> subfamily of the <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s. Since it has significant differences from its closest relative, the <a href="African%20river%20martin">African river martin</a>, it is sometimes placed in its own genus, "Eurochelidon". First found in 1968, it is known only from a single <a href="overwintering">wintering</a> site in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and may be <a href="extinction">extinct</a>, since it has not been seen since 1980 despite targeted surveys in Thailand and neighbouring Cambodia. It may possibly still breed in China or <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, but a Chinese painting initially thought to depict this species was later reassessed as showing <a href="pratincole">pratincole</a>s.

The adult white-eyed river martin is a medium-sized swallow, with mainly glossy greenish-black <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, a white rump, and a tail which has two elongated slender central tail feathers, each widening to a <a href="racket%20%28sports%20equipment%29">racket-shape</a> at the tip. It has a white eye ring and a broad, bright greenish-yellow bill. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the juvenile lacks the tail ornaments and is generally browner than the adult. Little is known of the behaviour or breeding habitat of this martin, although like other swallows it feeds on insects caught in flight, and its wide bill suggests that it may take relatively large species. It roosts in <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s in winter, and may nest in river sandbanks, probably in April or May before the summer rains. It may have been overlooked prior to its discovery because it tended to feed at dawn or dusk rather than during the day.

The martin's apparent demise may have been hastened by <a href="animal%20trapping">trapping</a>, <a href="habitat%20destruction">loss of habitat</a> and the construction of dams. The winter swallow roosts at the only known location of this martin have greatly reduced in numbers, and birds using river habitats for breeding have declined throughout the region. The white-eyed river martin is one of only two birds <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to Thailand, and the country's government has noted this through the issues of a stamp and a high-value commemorative coin.

Within the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family, the white-eyed river martin is one of only two members of the <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a> subfamily "Pseudochelidoninae", the other being the <a href="African%20river%20martin">African river martin</a> "Pseudochelidon eurystomina" of the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo basin</a> in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. These two species possess a number of distinctive features which mark them out from other swallows and martins, including their robust legs and feet, and stout bills. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of the two martins suggest that they are <a href="Relict%20%28biology%29">relict</a> populations of a group of species that <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> from the main swallow lineage early in its <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. The separation of this subfamily is supported by genetic evidence, and their habit of nesting in burrows is thought to be characteristic of the earliest members of the swallow family.

The white-eyed river martin was discovered in 1968 by <a href="Thailand">Thai</a> <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Kitti%20Thonglongya">Kitti Thonglongya</a>, who gave the bird its current <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a>. The genus name "Pseudochelidon" (<a href="Gustav%20Hartlaub">Hartlaub</a>, 1861) comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> prefix "ψευδο/pseudo" "false" and "χελιδον"/"chelidôn", "swallow", and the species name "sirintarae" commemorates <a href="Sirindhorn">Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn</a> of Thailand.

The African and Asian "Pseudochelidon" species differ markedly in the size of their <a href="beak">bills</a> and eyes, suggesting that they have different feeding <a href="ecology">ecologies</a>, with the white-eyed river martin probably able to take much larger prey. The Thai species also has a swollen, hard <a href="gape">gape</a> (fleshy interior of the bill) unlike the softer, fleshier, and much less prominent gape of the African river martin. Thonglongya estimated the bill of the Thai species to be 17.6% wider than that of the African bird, but a later estimate, using specimens preserved in alcohol instead of dried skins (to avoid shrinkage), gave a difference of 22.5% between the bills of the two swallows. Following a suggestion by Kitti in his original paper, Richard Brooke proposed in 1972 that the white-eyed river martin was sufficiently different from the African species to be placed in a separate <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus Eurochelidon, but this was contested by other authorities. The new genus was not subsequently widely adopted by other authors, although <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> uses "Eurochelidon".

The adult white-eyed river martin is a medium-sized swallow, long, with mainly silky black <a href="plumage">plumage</a> and a white rump. The back is green-glossed black, and is separated from the similarly coloured upper tail by a narrow bright white rump band. The head is darker than the back, with a velvet-black chin leading to blue-green glossed black underparts. The wings are black, with brown inner edges to the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s, and the tail is green-glossed black with two elongated, slender, central tail feathers, up to long. These expand slightly at the tips to give narrow racquets long. The wing length averages , the tail is long, and the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> averages .

The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and eyelid are white, giving the appearance of a white eye ring, and the broad, bright greenish-yellow bill has a black hooked tip to the upper <a href="mandible">mandible</a>. The large, strong feet and legs are flesh-coloured. This species is silent when wintering, and its breeding <a href="animal%20communication">vocalisations</a> are unknown. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile lacks the tail racquets, has a brown head and chin, and is generally browner than the adult. Juveniles taken in January and February were <a href="moulting">moulting</a> their body feathers.

The original Thai name for the Pseudochelidon, only known to local people in <a href="Bueng%20Boraphet">Bueng Boraphet</a>, was นกตาพอง Nok Ta Phong which may be roughly translated as "bird with enlarged eyes". After its official discovery in 1968, it was named เจ้าฟ้าหญิงสิรินธร Nok Chaofa Ying Sirinthon ("<a href="Maha%20Chakri%20Sirindhorn">Princess Sirindhorn</a> bird").

The white-eyed river martin was discovered in 1968 by Kitti Thonglongya, who obtained nine specimens netted by professional bird-hunters as part of a migratory bird survey at a night-time roost at Thailand's largest freshwater lake, <a href="Bueng%20Boraphet">Bueng Boraphet</a> in <a href="Nakhon%20Sawan%20Province">Nakhon Sawan Province</a>. It was first seen in the wild by ornithologists at the same wintering site in 1977. The species has only been seen at the lake, always between the months of November and February, and the wintering habitat is assumed to be in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed beds for the night-time roost.

The white-eyed river martin may be <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, and if the breeding habitat resembles that of the African river martin, it is likely to be the forested valleys of large rivers; these can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The breeding grounds and habitat are unknown, although river valleys in northern Thailand or southwestern <a href="China">China</a> are possibilities. A claimed depiction of this species in a Chinese scroll painting initially appeared to support the possibility of the martin breeding in China. The bird in the painting had a similarly shaped head and bill, a white eye and a long tail, although it lacked the white rump, did not show the correct bill colour, and elongated the outer, rather than central, tail feathers. Painted before 1970, it pre-dated the publication of pictures of the Thai bird, so it must have been painted from life. It is now thought more likely that the scroll shows <a href="Oriental%20pratincole">Oriental pratincole</a>s ("Glareola maldivarum"). <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> and <a href="Burma">Burma</a> have also been suggested as possible refuges for the martin, but there has also been speculation on whether it is migratory at all.

Since its breeding grounds are undiscovered, nothing is known about the white-eyed river martin's breeding biology, although it is suggested that it may nest in burrows in river sandbars, probably in April or May before the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> rain raises water levels. However, distinct differences in foot and toe <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> from its African relative have led some authorities to speculate that even the assumption that it nests in burrows could be incorrect. In winter, it roosts with <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>s in <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s.

Like other swallows, the white-eyed river martin feeds on <a href="insect">insect</a>s, including <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may well take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches, behaviour that, together with its unusual toe-shape and the fact that mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggest that this species may be relatively terrestrial.

<a href="Pamela%20C.%20Rasmussen">Pamela C. Rasmussen</a> suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or at least <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>, a factor that could make it very inconspicuous, and thus partly explain how it remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reedbeds might appear to contradict this theory, it is possible that the birds might not have been caught at the roost. Alternatively, they might be capable of both <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> and <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> behaviour, or be crepuscular, depending on the season or circumstance.

The white-eyed river martin was seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not definitely since, although there is an unconfirmed sighting from Thailand from 1986. It is classified as <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>, which is the highest risk category assigned by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> (IUCN) for wild species. The designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. The IUCN does not consider a species extinct until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted, but the white-eyed river martin may well no longer exist in the wild, and was probably always rare.

There has been a drastic decline in the Bueng Boraphet swallow population from the hundreds of thousands reported to roost around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981, although it is not certain if this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to hunting. Other potential causes for the martin's decline include the disturbance of sand bars in the rivers, and the construction of dams (which flood the area upstream and change the water flow downstream), deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. Other Southeast Asian species using riverine sand bars have also been adversely affected by disturbance and habitat degradation. Very few swallows of any kind now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. 

The martin is legally protected under Appendix 1 (the highest category) of the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) agreement, and is one of 15 "<a href="Reserved%20wild%20animals%20of%20Thailand">Reserved Species</a>" in Thailand which, under the provisions of the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act, BE 2535, cannot be legally hunted, collected, or kept in captivity under any circumstances. Despite official protection, the martin was captured by locals along with other <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s for sale as food or for <a href="Animals%20in%20Buddhism%23Release%20of%20animals">release</a> by devout <a href="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>, and following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers were reported to have caught as many as 120 individuals and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity. Two birds sent to Bangkok Zoo in 1971 also soon died. The small population may therefore have become non-viable.

Bueng Boraphet has been declared a Non-Hunting Area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. These include several searches at the main site, a 1969 survey of the <a href="Nan%20River">Nan</a>, <a href="Yom%20River">Yom</a> and <a href="Wang%20River">Wang River</a>s of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern <a href="Laos">Laos</a>. A possible sighting was made in Cambodia in 2004, but a 2008 investigation using speedboat surveys and interviews with villagers in Cambodia near the location of the claimed sighting failed to find any positive evidence, and noted that the habitat was in poor condition. Nevertheless, animals as a large as the <a href="saola">saola</a> have been rediscovered in Southeast Asia, so it is conceivable that a small population of the martin survives. Despite the lack of records from China, a 2000 <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a> covering the region included this species, since it is the mostly likely breeding area outside Thailand, although it is omitted from the 2008 "Birds of East Asia".

The white-eyed river martin and the <a href="Deignan%27s%20babbler">Deignan's babbler</a>, "Stachyridopsis rodolphei", are the only bird species <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to Thailand, and the martin has attracted sufficient interest to be featured on a 75 <a href="Thai%20baht">satang</a> <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> in 1975, as one of a set of four depicting Thai birds, and on a 5,000 <a href="Thai%20baht">Thai baht</a> conservation issue gold coin in 1974.

Proserpine (play)

Proserpine is a <a href="verse%20drama">verse drama</a> written for children by the English <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> writers <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> and her husband <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. Mary wrote the <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> drama and Percy contributed two <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyric poems</a>. Composed in 1820 while the Shelleys were living in Italy, it is often considered a partner to the Shelleys' play "<a href="Midas%20%28Shelley%29">Midas</a>". "Proserpine" was first published in the London periodical "The Winter's Wreath" in 1832. Whether the drama was ever intended to be staged is a point of debate among scholars.

The drama is based on <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s tale of the abduction of <a href="Proserpina">Proserpine</a> by <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>, which itself was based on the <a href="Greek%20myth">Greek myth</a> of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> and <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a>. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely <a href="feminist">feminist</a> retelling from <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Ceres's</a> point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The <a href="genre">genre</a>s of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.

"Proserpine" is part of a female literary tradition which, as <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary critic</a> <a href="Susan%20Gubar">Susan Gubar</a> describes it, has used the story of Ceres and Proserpine to "re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself". However, the play has been both neglected and marginalised by critics.

In March 1818 the Shelleys moved to Italy, where their two young children, Clara and William, soon died. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy. She recovered to some extent with the birth of <a href="Percy%20Florence%20Shelley">Percy Florence</a> later in 1819.

Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a considerable amount of drama, reading many of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play "<a href="The%20Cenci">The Cenci</a>", and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama "<a href="Prometheus%20Unbound%20%28Shelley%29">Prometheus Unbound</a>". The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate <a href="Vittorio%20Alfieri">Vittorio Alfieri</a>'s play "Mirra" (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel "<a href="Mathilda%20%28novella%29">Mathilda</a>".

Mary Shelley's studies were broad during these years. She began to learn Greek in 1820 and read widely. She had also been reading <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" since at least 1815 and continued to do so in 1820. Her other reading included <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s philosophical treatise, "" (1762) and his <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental novel</a>, "<a href="La%20Nouvelle%20Heloise">La Nouvelle Héloïse</a>" (1761), as well as <a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a>'s children's book "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Sandford%20and%20Merton">The History of Sandford and Merton</a>" (1783–89). Critic Marjean Purinton notes that her reading around the time she was composing "Proserpine" included "educational treatises and children's literature, replete with moralisms concerning gendered behaviors", as well as her mother <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>'s, "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787) and "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788). These latter were part of the <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> tradition that challenged the gender roles of women.

Mary Shelley composed "Proserpine" in 1820, finishing it on 3 April according to her journal. Percy Shelley contributed two <a href="lyric%20poem">lyric poem</a>s: "Arethusa" and "Song of Proserpine While Gathering Flowers on the Plain of Enna". A fragment of the manuscript survives, housed in the <a href="The%20Carl%20H.%20Pforzheimer%20Collection%20of%20Shelley%20and%20His%20Circle">Pforzheimer Collection</a> at the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a>, and demonstrates the couple working side-by-side on the project. According to their friend Thomas Medwin, Percy enjoyed the play, sometimes altering the manuscript as he was reading. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour speculates that both "Midas" and "Proserpine" were written for two young girls Mary Shelley met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe, daughters of friends of the Shelleys in Italy. Their mother was also a former pupil of <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, Mary Shelley's mother. That same year, Mary Shelley wrote the children's story "<a href="Maurice%20%28Shelley%29">Maurice</a>" for Laurette.

In 1824 Mary Shelley submitted "Proserpine" for publication to "The Browning Box", edited by <a href="Bryan%20Walter%20Procter">Bryan Walter Procter</a>, but it was rejected. The play was first published in 1832 in the London periodical "The Winter's Wreath". She cut one-fifth of the play—about 120 lines—for this version, deleting some of the stories from the first act, including Percy's poem "Arethusa", and rewrote individual lines. (She included "Arethusa" in her collection of "Posthumous Poems" of Percy Shelley in 1824.) Mary Shelley also added an ominous dream to the play, foreshadowing Proserpine's abduction. Her efforts to publish the play in these periodicals and journal entries written during the play's composition suggest that "Proserpine" was meant to be children's literature.

Act I begins with <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Ceres</a> leaving her daughter <a href="Proserpina">Proserpine</a> in the protection of two <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s, <a href="Ino%20%28Greek%20mythology%29">Ino</a> and <a href="Euno%C3%AB">Eunoe</a>, warning them not to wander. Proserpine asks Ino to tell her a story, and she recites the tale of <a href="Arethusa%20%28mythology%29">Arethusa</a>. After the story, the group gathers flowers. The two nymphs wander off, seeking ever more flowers, and lose sight of Proserpine. When they return, she is gone. They search for her in vain. Ceres returns, angry and frightened at the loss of her child:
Act II begins some time later. Ino laments: "How all is changed since that unhappy eve! / Ceres forever weeps, seeking her child / And in her rage has struck the land with blight". Arethusa comes, to tell Ceres that she saw <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a> make off with Proserpine. Ceres appeals to <a href="Jove">Jove</a> for assistance, and <a href="Iris%20%28mythology%29">Iris</a> appears, saying that Proserpine's fate is fixed. However, Jove agrees that if Proserpine does not eat the food of the <a href="Underworld">Underworld</a>, she can return. The group leaves to fetch Proserpine, who believes she has not consumed any tainted food, but she is reminded by <a href="Ascalaphus">Ascalaphus</a>, a shade of the Underworld, of some <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a> seeds that she ate. Ceres, Ino, and Arethusa volunteer to exile themselves to the Underworld, taking their treasures, such as fertility, with them. However, their sacrifice is not permitted. Iris relates Jove's decision regarding Proserpine's fate: 

Ceres promises that only during the time when Proserpine lives with her will the earth be fertile.

"Proserpine" is a <a href="verse%20drama">verse drama</a> in <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> by Mary Shelley which includes two <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyric poems</a> by Percy Shelley. In the early nineteenth century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets, and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in "Proserpine" reflects this trend. Percy's poems help emphasise the mythic nature of Proserpine's story; he continued this transcendental description of Proserpine in his "<a href="Prometheus%20Unbound%20%28Shelley%29">Prometheus Unbound</a>". Mary's drama consists of carefully described objects, such as flowers. Furthermore, her characters do not speak in <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a>—except in Percy's poems—rather, "nearly every speech is directed feelingly toward another character and is typically concerned with describing another's emotional state, and/or eliciting an emotional reaction." Dialogue in "Proserpine" is founded on empathy, not the conflict more typical of drama. Mary Shelley also refused to embrace the visual sensationalism of early nineteenth-century theatre, focusing instead on "scenes of heightened emotion".

Scholars have disputed whether or not Mary Shelley intended her play to be staged. Most concur that it was never meant for performance, agreeing with Romanticist Alan Richardson that the play is "lyrical drama" or "mental theater" in the style of Romantic <a href="closet%20drama">closet drama</a> "with its emphasis on character over plot, on reaction over action, and its turn away from the theater". However, eighteenth-century theatrical scholar Judith Pascoe challenges this conclusion, pointing to detailed stage directions in the manuscript: "Ceres and her companions are ranged on one side in eager expectation; from the cave on the other, enter Proserpine, attended by various dark & gloomy shapes bearing torches; among which Ascalaphus. Ceres & Persephone embrace;–her nymphs surround her." From this evidence, she argues that Shelley intended her play to be staged.

Literary scholar <a href="Jeffrey%20N.%20Cox">Jeffrey Cox</a> has argued that "Proserpine", along with "Midas", "Prometheus Unbound" and other plays written by the <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a> circle, were "not a rejection of the stage but an attempt to remake it". Turning from the traditional genres of <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a> and <a href="comedy%20of%20manners">comedy of manners</a>, these writers reinvented drama by writing <a href="masque">masque</a>s and <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a> dramas. He argues that "Midas" and "Proserpine" are a pair of mythological dramas that demonstrate "the forces of oppression". For him, "Proserpine" "celebrates a pastoral world...threatened by male sexual violence and the tyranny of a sky god".

Mary Shelley expanded and revised the Roman poet <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s story of Proserpine, which is part of his larger "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>". The tale is based on the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myth</a> of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> and <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a>, which explains the change of the seasons through Persephone's visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to <a href="Hades">Hades</a>'s realm, autumn and winter cover the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation. Like Percy Shelley, <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>, and <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their <a href="patriarchy">patriarchal</a> themes. In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as "an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon" while "Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent" who wants to find flowers for her mother. Ovid's version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley's play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine. Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs’ grief and Proserpine's own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.

Women and women's issues dominate Mary Shelley's drama—no male characters appear, with the brief exception of <a href="Ascalaphus">Ascalaphus</a>. However, as Romanticist Marjean Purinton argues, there is a strong masculine presence in the play even without male characters, suggesting "the ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in the <a href="Separate%20spheres">domestic sphere</a>". Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community—these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate. Ceres's love—a mother's love—challenges the power of the gods. Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres's point of view; "her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as ‘Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.’ " Shelley writes active, rather than passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres's anger, not her grief, that brings "winter's blight". However, Proserpine's abduction is prefigured in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.

In Shelley's version of the myth, paradise is lost not through the fault of women but through the interference of men. Pluto's "egotistical, predatory violence" is juxtaposed with Ceres's "loving kindness, her willingness to sustain life, [and] her unswerving devotion to her child". Sex, in this myth, is represented as a separation from the feminine and a forced surrender to the masculine. Pluto's domination of Proserpine symbolises "a culture based on acquisition and brutality, a culture that covertly justifies (when it does not overtly celebrate) male mastery".

"Proserpine" and "Midas" are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays. "Proserpine" is a play of female bonding, while "Midas" is a male-dominated drama; male poets participate in a contest in "Midas" while in "Proserpine" female characters participate in communal storytelling; "where Midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at the center of an all-powerful court, Ceres laments leaving the pastoral enclave she shares with Proserpine for Jove's court"; Midas focuses on gold, while the women in "Proserpine" enjoy flowers; and "where the society of "Midas" is marked by egotism, greed, and strife, the female society of "Proserpine" values community, gift-giving, and love".

As <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary critic</a> <a href="Susan%20Gubar">Susan Gubar</a> argues, Mary Shelley's drama is part of a female literary tradition, including <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, <a href="H.D.">H.D.</a>, <a href="Toni%20Morrison">Toni Morrison</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>, and <a href="Doris%20Lessing">Doris Lessing</a>, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a "way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood...they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself." Poets such as <a href="Dorothy%20Wellesley">Dorothy Wellesley</a>, <a href="Rachel%20Annand%20Taylor">Rachel Annand Taylor</a>, <a href="Babette%20Deutsch">Babette Deutsch</a>, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge "the divisions between self and other" that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet <a href="Adrienne%20Rich">Adrienne Rich</a> writes that "the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, is the essential female tragedy", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.

When A. Koszul first published a transcription of "Proserpine" in 1922, he argued "that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works". However, his "Introduction" to the play speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley's works. In fact, as he explains, he decided to publish to contribute to the Percy Shelley centenary. Since their original publication, neither "Midas" nor "Proserpine" has received much critical attention. Critics have either paid attention only to Percy Shelley's poems, or have ignored the plays altogether. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie writes that the plays are "distinguished only by the lyrics that [Percy] Shelley wrote for them", and Sylvia Norman contends that they "do not really call for analytical and comparative study". While "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" has remained a powerful cultural force since its publication, Mary Shelley's other works have rarely been reprinted and scholars have focused almost exclusively on Mary Shelley, author of "Frankenstein", and Mary Shelley, wife of <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. However, with the publication of works by <a href="Mary%20Poovey">Mary Poovey</a> and <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> in the 1980s and "The Other Mary Shelley" in 1993, more attention has been paid to Mary Shelley's "other" works, such as her dramas.

Confederate government of Kentucky

The Confederate government of Kentucky was a <a href="Continuity%20of%20government">shadow government</a> established for the <a href="Commonwealth%20%28United%20States%29">Commonwealth</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> by a self-constituted group of <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> sympathizers during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>, which had strong <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> sympathies. Neither was it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the Confederate States of America, and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the <a href="Flags%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America%23Battle%20flag">Confederate battle flag</a>.

<a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green, Kentucky</a>, was designated the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a>. Due to the military situation in the state, the provisional government was <a href="government%20in%20exile">exiled</a> and traveled with the <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> for most of its existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a> controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a> attempted to install the provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved at the end of the war.

The provisional government elected two governors. <a href="George%20W.%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">George W. Johnson</a> was elected at the Russellville Convention and served until his death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. <a href="Richard%20Hawes">Richard Hawes</a> was elected to replace Johnson and served through the remainder of the war.

Kentucky's citizens were split regarding the issues central to the Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> cities such as <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a> while at the same time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> was within the Union.

The <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">presidential election of 1860</a> showed Kentucky's mixed sentiments when the state gave <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a> 45% of the popular vote, <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> 36%, <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> 18%, and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> less than 1%. Historian Allan Nevins interpreted the election results to mean that Kentuckians strongly opposed both <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">secession</a> and coercion against the secessionists. The majority coalition of Bell and Douglas supporters was seen as a solid moderate Unionist position that opposed precipitate action by extremists on either side.
The majority of Kentucky's citizens believed the state should be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Governor</a> <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a> sent a letter to the other slave state governors, suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, and a Southern <a href="veto">veto</a> over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.

Governor Magoffin called a special session of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> on December 27, 1860, to ask the legislators for a convention to decide the Commonwealth's course in the sectional conflict. The "Louisville Morning Courier" on January 25, 1861, articulated the position that the secessionists faced in the legislature, "Too much time has already been wasted. The historic moment once past, never returns. For us and for Kentucky, the time to act is NOW OR NEVER." The Unionists, on the other hand, were unwilling to surrender the fate of the state to a convention that might "in a moment of excitement, adopt the extreme remedy of secession." The Unionist position carried after many of the states rights' legislators, opposing the idea of immediate secession, voted against the convention. The assembly did, however, send six delegates to a February 4 <a href="Peace%20Conference%20of%201861">Peace Conference</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and asked <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>, proposed by Kentuckian <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>.

As a result of the firing on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, President Lincoln sent a <a href="telegram">telegram</a> to Governor Magoffin requesting that the Commonwealth supply four regiments as its share of the overall request of 75,000 troops for the war. Magoffin, a Confederate sympathizer, replied, "President Lincoln, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern states</a>. B. Magoffin" Both houses of the General Assembly met on May 7 and passed <a href="Kentucky%20Declaration%20of%20Neutrality">declarations of neutrality</a> in the war, a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20.

In a special congressional election held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the <a href="Jackson%20Purchase">Jackson Purchase</a> region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a>s. Believing defeat at the polls was certain, many Southern Rightists had <a href="election%20boycott">boycotted the election</a>; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000. Confederate sympathizers were dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in <a href="veto">veto</a>-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> and 27–11 in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Senate</a>. From then on, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.

Historian Wilson Porter Shortridge made the following analysis:
With secession no longer considered a viable option, the pro-Confederate forces became the strongest supporters for neutrality. Unionists dismissed this as a front for a secessionist agenda. Unionists, on the other hand, struggled to find a way to move the large, moderate middle to a "definite and unqualified stand with the Washington government." The maneuvering between the two reached a decisive point on September 3 when Confederate forces were ordered from Tennessee to the Kentucky towns of <a href="Hickman%2C%20Kentucky">Hickman</a> and <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus</a>. Union forces responded by occupying <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a>.

On September 11, the legislature passed a resolution instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor vetoed the resolution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested the assistance of the Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request. Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.

A pro-Confederate peace meeting, with Breckinridge as a speaker, was scheduled for September 21. Unionists feared the meeting would lead to actual military resistance, and dispatched troops from <a href="Camp%20Dick%20Robinson">Camp Dick Robinson</a> to disband the meeting and arrest Breckinridge. Breckinridge, as well as many other state leaders identified with the secessionists, fled the state. These leaders eventually served as the nucleus for a group that would create a shadow government for Kentucky. In his October 8 "Address to the People of Kentucky," Breckinridge declared, "The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> no longer exists. The Union is dissolved."

On October 29, 1861, 63 delegates representing 34 <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">counties</a> met at <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a> to discuss the formation of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth. Despite its defeats at the polls, this group believed that the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens. <a href="Trigg%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Trigg County</a>'s <a href="Henry%20Cornelius%20Burnett">Henry Burnett</a> was elected chairman of the proceedings. <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County</a> farmer George W. Johnson chaired the committee that wrote the convention's final report and introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government. Both Breckinridge and Johnson served on the Committee of Ten that arranged the convention.
On November 18, 116 delegates from 68 counties met at the <a href="William%20Forst%20House">William Forst House</a> in Russellville. Burnett was elected presiding officer. Fearing for the safety of the delegates, he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862. Johnson convinced the majority of the delegates to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of <a href="Bethel%20College%20%28Kentucky%29">Bethel Female College</a>, a now-defunct institution in Hopkinsville.

The first item was ratification of an <a href="ordinance%20of%20secession">ordinance of secession</a>, which proceeded in short order. Next, being unable to flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that "the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Constitution</a> and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, and the establishment of this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state." The delegates proposed a provisional government to consist of a legislative council of ten members (one from each Kentucky congressional district); a governor, who had the power to appoint judicial and other officials; a treasurer; and an auditor. The delegates designated Bowling Green (then under the control of Confederate general <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>) as the Confederate State capital, but had the foresight to provide for the government to meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the council and governor. The convention adopted a new <a href="Seals%20of%20the%20U.S.%20states">state seal</a>, an arm wearing <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a> with a star, extended from a circle of twelve other stars.

The convention unanimously elected Johnson as governor. <a href="Horatio%20F.%20Simrall">Horatio F. Simrall</a> was elected <a href="lieutenant%20governor">lieutenant governor</a>, but soon fled to <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> to escape Federal authorities. Robert McKee, who had served as secretary of both conventions, was appointed secretary of state. <a href="Theodore%20Legrand%20Burnett">Theodore Legrand Burnett</a> was elected treasurer, but resigned on December 17 to accept a position in the <a href="Confederate%20Congress">Confederate Congress</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Warren County</a> native John Quincy Burnham. The position of auditor was first offered to former Congressman <a href="Richard%20Hawes">Richard Hawes</a>, but Hawes declined to continue his military service under <a href="Humphrey%20Marshall%20%28general%29">Humphrey Marshall</a>. In his stead, the convention elected Josiah Pillsbury, also of Warren County. The legislative council elected <a href="Willis%20Benson%20Machen">Willis Benson Machen</a> as its president.

On November 21, the day following the convention, Johnson wrote Confederate president <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> to request Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett, <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a>, and <a href="William%20E.%20Simms">William E. Simms</a> were chosen as the state's commissioners to the Confederacy. For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. <a href="Luke%20P.%20Blackburn">Luke P. Blackburn</a>, a native Kentuckian living in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, was invited to accompany the commissioners to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. Though Davis had reservations about circumvention of the elected <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> in forming the Confederate government, he concluded that Johnson's request had merit, and on November 25, recommended Kentucky for admission to the Confederacy. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861.

On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson issued an address to the citizens of the Commonwealth blaming <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>s for the breakup of the United States. He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, and that the only solution to the war was a free trade agreement between the two sovereign nations. He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin. Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will of the majority of the Commonwealth's citizens.
During the winter of 1861, Johnson tried to assert the legitimacy of the fledgling government but its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3 million ($ as of 2019) from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2 million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a> and President Davis. Much of the provisional government's operating capital was probably provided by Kentucky congressman <a href="Eli%20Metcalfe%20Bruce">Eli Metcalfe Bruce</a>, who made a fortune from varied economic activities throughout the war.

The council met on December 14 to appoint representatives to the Confederacy's <a href="Unicameralism">unicameral</a> provisional congress. Those appointed would serve for only two months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent <a href="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, was elected to the Confederate Senate.

The provisional government took other minor actions during the winter of 1861. An act was passed to rename <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Wayne County</a> to Zollicoffer County in honor of <a href="Felix%20Zollicoffer">Felix Zollicoffer</a>, who died at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mill%20Springs">Battle of Mill Springs</a>. Local officials were appointed in areas controlled by Confederate forces, including many <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justices of the peace</a>. When the Confederate government eventually disbanded, the legality of marriages performed by these justices was questioned, but eventually upheld.

Following <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Battle of Fort Henry</a>, General Johnston withdrew from Bowling Green into <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> on February 7, 1862. A week later, Governor Johnson and the provisional government followed. On March 12, the "<a href="The%20Times-Picayune">New Orleans Picayune</a>" reported that "the capital of Kentucky [is] now being located in a Sibley tent."

Governor Johnson, despite his presumptive official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. On April 7, Johnson was severely wounded in the thigh and abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, <a href="Alexander%20McDowell%20McCook">Alexander McDowell McCook</a>, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship "Hannibal", and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.

Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson requested that Richard Hawes come to the city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor. Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, and took the oath of office on May 31.

During the summer of 1862, word began to spread through the Army of Tennessee that Generals Bragg and <a href="Edmund%20Kirby%20Smith">Edmund Kirby Smith</a> were planning an invasion of Kentucky. The legislative council voted to endorse the invasion plan, and on August 27, Governor Hawes was dispatched to Richmond to favorably recommend it to President Davis. Davis was non-committal, but Bragg and Smith proceeded, nonetheless.

On August 30, Smith commanded one of the most complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Richmond">Battle of Richmond</a>. Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 <a href="Battle%20of%20Munfordville">Battle of Munfordville</a>, but the delay there cost him the larger prize of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25. Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of <a href="Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky">Bardstown</a>, <a href="Shelbyville%2C%20Kentucky">Shelbyville</a> and <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville</a> and waited for something to happen, a move that historian <a href="Kenneth%20W.%20Noe">Kenneth W. Noe</a> called a "stupendously illogical decision."

Meanwhile, the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government had remained in <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a> on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed with the number of soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.

Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a>, the provisional government left Kentucky for the final time. Displaced from their home state, members of the legislative council dispersed to places where they could make a living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session. Scant records show that on December 30, 1862, Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at <a href="Athens%2C%20Tennessee">Athens, Tennessee</a> for a meeting on January 15, 1863. Hawes himself unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes' former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command. On March 4, Hawes told Davis by letter that "our cause is steadily on the increase" and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.

The government's financial woes also continued. Hawes was embarrassed to admit that neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus</a> to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a> during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.

Late in the war, the provisional government existed mostly on paper. However, in the summer of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by Brigadier General <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a> during his latest raid into Kentucky. Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864.

There is no documentation detailing exactly when Kentucky's provisional government ceased operation. It is assumed to have dissolved upon the conclusion of the Civil War.

Roy Dowling

<a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28Australia%29">Vice Admiral</a> Sir Roy Russell Dowling, (28 May 1901 – 15 April 1969) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN). He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Naval Staff</a> (CNS), the RAN's highest-ranking position, from 1955 until 1959, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>, from 1959 until 1961.

Born in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Dowling entered the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> in 1915. After graduating in 1919 he went to sea aboard various <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and RAN vessels, and later specialised in gunnery. In 1937, he was given command of the sloop . Following the outbreak of World War II, he saw action in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean theatre</a> as <a href="Executive%20officer%23Military">executive officer</a> of the Royal Navy cruiser , and survived her sinking by a German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> in March 1942. Returning to Australia, he served as Director of Plans and later Deputy Chief of Naval Staff before taking command of the light cruiser in November 1944. His achievements in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>.

Dowling took command of the RAN's first aircraft carrier, , in 1948. He became Chief of Naval Personnel in 1950, and <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet</a> in 1953. Soon after taking up the position of CNS in February 1955, he was promoted to vice admiral and appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>. As CNS he had to deal with shortages of money, manpower and equipment, and with the increasing role of the United States in Australia's defence planning, at the expense of traditional ties with Britain. <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knighted</a> in 1957, Dowling was Chairman of COSC from March 1959 until May 1961, when he retired from the military. In 1963 he was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> and became Australian Secretary to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, serving until his death in 1969.

Roy Russell Dowling was born on 28 May 1901 in <a href="Condong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Condong</a>, a township on the <a href="Tweed%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Tweed River</a> in northern New South Wales. His parents were sugar cane inspector Russell Dowling and his wife Lily. The youth entered the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a> (RANC) at <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>, <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Federal Capital Territory</a>, in 1915. An underachiever academically, he excelled at sports, and became chief cadet captain before graduating in 1918 with the King's Medal, awarded for "gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities". The following year he was posted to Britain as a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a>, undergoing training with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and seeing service on and . By January 1923 he was back in Australia, serving aboard the cruiser . He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a> in March. In April 1924, "Adelaide" joined the Royal Navy's <a href="Cruise%20of%20the%20Special%20Service%20Squadron">Special Service Squadron on its worldwide cruise</a>, taking in New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Panama, and the West Indies, before docking in September at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, England. There Dowling left the ship for his next appointment, training as a gunnery officer and serving in that capacity at .

After his return to Australia in December 1926, Dowling spent eighteen months on and , where he continued to specialise in gunnery. In July 1928, he took on an instructional role at the gunnery school in <a href="HMAS%20Cerberus%20%28naval%20base%29">Flinders Naval Depot</a> on <a href="Western%20Port%20Bay">Western Port Bay</a>, Victoria. He married Jessie Blanch in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 8 May 1930; the couple had two sons and three daughters. Jessie accompanied him on his next posting to Britain commencing in January 1931. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> on 15 March, and was appointed gunnery officer on the light cruiser in May. Dowling returned to Australia in January 1933, and was appointed squadron gunnery officer aboard the heavy cruiser that April. The ship operated mainly within Australian waters over the next two years. In July 1935, Dowling took charge of the gunnery school at Flinders Naval Depot. He was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> on 31 December 1936. The following month, he assumed command of the newly commissioned <a href="Grimsby-class%20sloop">"Grimsby"-class</a> sloop , carrying out duties in the South West Pacific. Completing his tenure on "Swan" in January 1939, he was briefly assigned to the Navy Office, Melbourne, before returning to Britain in March for duty at <a href="HMS%20Pembroke%23Shore%20establishments">HMS "Pembroke"</a>, where he awaited posting aboard the yet-to-be-commissioned anti-aircraft cruiser, .

Dowling became <a href="Executive%20officer%23Military">executive officer</a> on HMS "Naiad" when the ship was commissioned in 1940. Following service with the British <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>, the cruiser transferred to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Station</a> in May 1941, where she took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a>. She was involved in action against German <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s on the night of 20/21 May. On 22 May, after engaging a German destroyer with , "Naiad" was severely damaged by air attack. Following repairs, she became <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the 15th Cruiser Squadron and conducted shore bombardments in support of Allied troops during the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syrian campaign</a> in June and July. She also escorted <a href="Malta%20Convoys">convoys resupplying Malta</a>. In December, "Naiad" participated in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> against Italian naval forces. On 11 March 1942, she was torpedoed by a German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> off the Egyptian coast, and sank in just over twenty minutes. Dowling remained in the water for an hour and a half before being rescued by a destroyer.
Having survived "Naiad"s sinking, Dowling returned to Australia and was appointed Director of Plans at the Navy Office in July 1942. In September the following year he was made Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS) and raised to acting <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a>; his rank became substantive in June 1944. As DCNS, he was involved in planning the post-war Navy's composition, which for the first time was to include <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s. He defined the functions of maritime power in October 1943 as:
In November 1944, Dowling was given command of the light cruiser , which had been undergoing repair and refit in Sydney since being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomons</a> on 20 July 1943. Dowling took her on her shakedown cruise to Melbourne on 30 December, before embarking for the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> in February 1945. The following month, "Hobart" supported the US forces that recaptured <a href="Cebu">Cebu</a> during the <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">liberation of the Philippines</a>. She bombarded <a href="Tarakan%20Island">Tarakan Island</a> prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">Allied invasion</a> on 1 May and, later that month, covered the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 6th Division</a>'s <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">operations at Wewak</a>. The cruiser supported the <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">Allied landings on Brunei</a> in June, and on <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">Balikpapan</a> in July. For his "outstanding courage, skill and initiative" during these operations, Dowling was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO), <a href="The%20London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 6 November 1945.

Dowling joined the Australian contingent at the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, "Hobart" became flagship of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling flag captain and chief of staff to Commodore <a href="John%20Augustine%20Collins">John Collins</a>, the squadron commander. The war had taken a toll on Dowling's health, and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office. Rear Admiral <a href="James%20Goldrick">James Goldrick</a>, in the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", observed that Dowling "was thrust into the highest positions of the RAN largely as a result of the heavy casualties of World War II". When John Armstrong—the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain—was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty, Dowling was given the chance to command Australia's first aircraft carrier, , commissioned in England on 16 December 1948. In April the following year, two months after the ship's belated acceptance into service due to teething troubles, Dowling embarked "Sydney" for Australia with two squadrons of fighters aboard. In June 1950, he was promoted to <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">commodore</a> and appointed Second Naval Member and Chief of Naval Personnel, serving in this capacity until the end of 1952. His term coincided with the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, and resultant increased demands on manpower. Dowling was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the 1953 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>, before travelling to London to attend the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>. Raised to <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> in July 1953, he returned home to take up the post of <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet</a> that December, serving through the following year. He had to preside over cutbacks to operations brought on by government stringency after the end of the Korean War.
On 24 February 1955, Dowling succeeded Vice Admiral Sir John Collins as <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">First Naval Member, Australian Commonwealth Naval Board, and Chief of Naval Staff</a> (CNS). He was promoted to <a href="vice%20admiral">vice admiral</a> on 7 June, and appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> two days later. On 15 June, he joined fellow chiefs of staff Lieutenant General <a href="Henry%20Wells%20%28general%29">Henry Wells</a> and Air Marshal <a href="John%20McCauley">John McCauley</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, and senior government members in approving a draft directive for the role of the <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Far East Strategic Reserve</a> (FESR); this made Commonwealth forces available for the fight against <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">communist insurgents in Malaya</a>, as well as for the security of Malaya and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> against external aggression. The Navy's contribution to the FESR was to be at least two destroyers or frigates on an ongoing basis, as well as a yearly visit by an aircraft carrier. The destroyers and , already in the region on an exercise, were immediately committed, and Dowling flew to Singapore to personally announce the plan and the reasons for it to the ships' crews.

Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet; in 1963, after several false starts, the first of six <a href="Oberon-class%20submarine">"Oberon"-class submarines</a> was ordered. As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a>'s surface fleet, Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a>. In March 1956, he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN's <a href="De%20Havilland%20Sea%20Venom">De Havilland Sea Venom</a>s. During much of Dowling's remaining time as CNS, faced with the obsolescence of HMAS "Sydney" and in accordance with its two-carrier policy, the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment . Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain's <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Earl Mountbatten</a>. Taking into account the provisions of the <a href="ANZUS">ANZUS</a> treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain, the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment, as Dowling explained to Mountbatten:

Other issues facing the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation—since the beginning of the 1950s—to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered "separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street" as the causes for the Navy's inability to attract and retain personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to service conditions, which helped reduce wastage. The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.

Dowling was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1957 New Year Honours, and completed his term as CNS on 23 February 1959. On 23 March he took over from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a role foreshadowing that of the latter-day <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>. He was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral <a href="Henry%20Burrell%20%28admiral%29">Henry Burrell</a>. Happily surprised by his appointment as Chairman of COSC, Dowling hoped to transform the position such that it would exercise command authority over the service chiefs, but in this he was to be disappointed. The position's rank remained the same as the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department's decision—rescinded after his term—to disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's failure to back him when he announced at a <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">SEATO</a> press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the <a href="Laotian%20Civil%20War">second Laotian crisis</a> should it become necessary. In September 1959, during the first Laotian crisis, the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit "an infantry battalion, a squadron of RAAF fighters, air transport, and two RAN destroyers" to support US and SEATO forces, but no intervention took place.

Dowling retired from the military on 27 May 1961 and was succeeded as Chairman of COSC by Air Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Sir Frederick Scherger</a>. Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment, nothing was offered to him and, as a practising <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a>, he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra. In July 1962, the government gave him responsibility for organising Queen Elizabeth II's upcoming royal tour. In this role he was required to liaise with the state governments to plan the Queen's itinerary, and to become a member of the royal household for the duration of the tour, the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch. He was rewarded with appointment as a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (KCVO) as of 27 March 1963, and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1 November the same year. Dowling was also the <a href="Australian%20Red%20Cross">Australian Red Cross Society</a>'s Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967; at the time he took over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation, in the absence of <a href="William%20Oliver%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Lady William Oliver</a>. Roy Dowling died of a <a href="coronary%20occlusion">heart attack</a> on 15 April 1969 in <a href="Canberra%20Hospital">Canberra Hospital</a>. He was given a naval funeral at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid">St John's Church</a>, and cremated. His wife and five children survived him.

African crake

The African crake ("Crex egregia") is away from the arid south and southwest. It is seasonally common in most of its range other than the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s and areas that have low annual rainfall. This crake is a partial <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>, moving away from the <a href="equator">equator</a> as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. There have been a few records of <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests in a wide variety of grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.

A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and black-and-white barring on the flanks and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, and a white line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the <a href="corn%20crake">corn crake</a>; that species is also <a href="plumage">lighter-plumaged</a>, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating "krrr" notes. It is active during the day, and is <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a>, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds on a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host <a href="parasitism">parasites</a>. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.

The <a href="Rallidae">rails</a> are a bird <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> comprising nearly 150 species. Although the origins of the group are lost in antiquity, the largest number of species and the most primitive forms are found in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>, suggesting that this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the African crake is the corn crake, "C. crex", which breeds in Europe and Asia, but winters in Africa. The African crake was first described as "Ortygometra egregia" by <a href="Wilhelm%20Peters">Wilhelm Peters</a> in 1854 from a specimen collected in Mozambique, but the genus name failed to become established. For some time it was placed as the sole member of the genus "Crecopsis" but subsequently moved to "<a href="Crex">Crex</a>", created for this species by German naturalist and ornithologist <a href="Johann%20Matth%C3%A4us%20Bechstein">Johann Matthäus Bechstein</a> in 1803. <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a> considered that the African bird differed sufficiently from the corn crake to have its own genus "Crecopsis", and later authors sometimes placed it in "<a href="Porzana">Porzana</a>", based on a resemblance to the <a href="ash-throated%20crake">ash-throated crake</a>, "P. albicollis". Structural differences rule out "Porzana", and the placement in "Crex" is now the most common and best-supported treatment. <a href="Phylogenetics">Phylogeny</a> and <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> confirm that the "Porzana" crakes are the closest relatives of the genus "Crex". The genus name is <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, referring to the repetitive grating call of the corn crake, and the species name "egregia" derives from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "egregius", "outstanding, prominent".

The African crake is a smallish crake, long with a wingspan. The male has blackish upperparts streaked with olive-brown, apart from the nape and hindneck which are plain pale brown; there is a white streak from the base of the bill to above the eye. The sides of the head, foreneck, throat and breast are bluish-grey, the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s are dark brown, and the flanks and sides of the belly are barred black and white. The eye is red, the bill is reddish, and the legs and feet are light brown or grey. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the female is slightly smaller and duller than the male, with a less contrasting head pattern. Immature birds have darker and duller upperparts than the adult, a dark bill, grey eye, and less barring on the underparts. There are no <a href="subspecies">subspecific</a> or other geographical variations in plumage. This crake has a complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> after breeding, mainly prior to migration. Although this species occurs in fairly open habitats, it lacks the pure white undertail used for signalling in open water or <a href="wikt%3Agregarious">gregarious</a> species like the <a href="coot">coot</a>s and <a href="moorhen">moorhen</a>s.

The African crake is smaller than the corn crake, which also has darker upperparts, a plain grey face and different underparts barring pattern. In flight, the African species has shorter, blunter wings with a less prominent white leading edge, and deeper wingbeats than its relative. Other <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> crakes are smaller with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and a shorter bill. The <a href="African%20rail">African rail</a> has dark brown upperparts, a long red bill and red legs and feet.

Like other rails, this species has a wide range of vocalisations. The male's territorial and advertising call is a series of rapid grating "krrr" notes repeated two or three times a second for several minutes. It is given most often in the breeding season, usually early or late in the day, but sometimes continues after dark or starts before dawn. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, but will also call when chasing intruders on the ground or in flight. Both sexes give a sharp, loud "kip" call as an alarm or during territorial interactions, adapting a similar pose as for the advertising call. Once breeding starts, the birds become much quieter, but territorial birds commence the "kip" call again during the non-breeding season, especially when there is a high density of African crakes in the area. A wheezy "kraaa" is associated with threat displays and copulation; imitation of this call by a human can bring a rail to within . Newly hatched chicks make a soft "wheeeez" call, and older chicks cheep.

The rasping advertising call is readily distinguished from the "hwitt-hwitt-hwitt" of <a href="spotted%20crake">spotted crake</a>, the monotonous clockwork "tak-tak-tak-tak-tak" of <a href="striped%20crake">striped crake</a>, or the "quick-quick" of <a href="Baillon%27s%20crake">Baillon's crake</a>. The corn crake is silent in Africa.

The African crake occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Kenya, and south to <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>, South Africa, except in arid areas of south and southwest Africa where the annual summer rainfall is less than . It is widespread and locally common in most of its range, apart from the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s and the drier regions. Nearly all the South Africa population of about 8,000 birds occur in KwaZulu-Natal and the former <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal Province</a>, and much good habitat is protected in the <a href="Kruger%20National%20Park">Kruger National Park</a> and <a href="iSimangaliso%20Wetland%20Park">iSimangaliso Wetland Park</a>. This crake is only a <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> to southern Mauritania, southwest Niger, Lesotho, South Africa's northern and eastern <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> and <a href="North%20West%20%28South%20African%20province%29">North West Province</a>, and southern Botswana. Further afield, it is rare on <a href="Bioko">Bioko Island</a> (Equatorial Guinea), and there have been two records each for <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">Sao Tome</a> and <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> birds being the first records for the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Western Palaeartic</a>. <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> remains from <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> suggest that the species may have been more widespread when the climate was wetter in what is now the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. 

This crake is a partial <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>, but although it is less skulking than many of its relatives, its movements are complex and poorly studied; the distribution map is therefore largely hypothetical. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds move away from the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; north-south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Migration takes place at night and involves small groups of up to eight birds; It may be one or two months after the rains begin before the grass is sufficiently high for breeding birds to arrive. Even in southern Africa, some birds may stay after breeding if enough usable habitat remains.

The habitat is predominantly grassland, ranging from wetland edges and seasonal floodlands to <a href="savanna">savanna</a>, lightly wooded dry grassland, and grassy forest clearings. The crake also frequents maize, rice and cotton crops, derelict farmland and sugarcane plantations close to water. A wide range of grass species are used, with a preferred height of tall but vegetation is acceptable up to tall. It normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake, and its breeding territories often contain or are close to thickets or <a href="termite">termite</a> mounds. It occurs from sea level to but is rare in the higher altitude grasslands. Its grassland habitat is frequently burned in the dry season, forcing the birds to move elsewhere. In an East African study, the average area occupied by one bird was when breeding, and at other times. The highest densities occur in lush or moist grassland such as the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a>.

The African crake is active during the day, especially at dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. It is less skulking and easier to flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen at the edges of roads and tracks. An observer in a vehicle can approach to within . When a bird is flushed it normally flies less than , but new arrivals may occasionally fly twice as far. A flushed crake will frequently land in a wet area or behind a thicket, and crouch on landing. In short grass, it can escape from a dog using its speed and manoeuvrability, running with the body held almost horizontal. It may roost in a depression near grass tussock and it will bathe in puddles.

The African crake is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk side by side with another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.

Breeding behavior commences with a courtship chase with the female running in a crouch, pursued by the male, who adopts a more upright stance and has his neck outstretched. The female may stop and lower her head and tail to allow copulation; this takes just a few seconds, but may be repeated several times in an hour. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves, sometimes with a loose canopy, built in a depression and hidden under a grass tussock or small bush; it may be on dry ground or slightly raised above standing water, or occasionally floating. The nest is about across with the internal cup deep, and wide. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size is from 3 to 11 pink-coloured eggs; the first is often laid when the nest is little more than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day. Both sexes incubate, and the eggs start hatching after about 14 days; all hatch with 48 hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. <a href="Fledge">Fledging</a> occurs after four to five weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether a second brood is raised.

The African crake feeds on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s including <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s and the adults and <a href="larva">larva</a>e of insects, especially <a href="termite">termite</a>s, <a href="ant">ant</a>s, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s. <a href="Vertebrate">Vertebrate</a> prey such as small frogs or fish may also be taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as <a href="great%20snipe">great snipe</a>s, <a href="blue%20quail">blue quail</a>s and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.

Predators include the <a href="leopard">leopard</a>, <a href="serval">serval</a>, <a href="cat">cat</a>s, the <a href="black-headed%20heron">black-headed heron</a>, <a href="dark%20chanting%20goshawk">dark chanting goshawk</a>, <a href="African%20hawk-eagle">African hawk-eagle</a> and <a href="Wahlberg%27s%20eagle">Wahlberg's eagle</a>. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks were taken by a <a href="boomslang">boomslang</a>. If surprised, an African crake will leap vertically into the air before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.

Parasites of this species include <a href="tick">tick</a>s of the family <a href="Ixodidae">Ixodidae</a>, and a <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>, "Metanalges elongatus", of the subspecies "M. e. curtus". The <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate</a> form of the mite occurs thousands of kilometres away in <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>.

The African crake has a huge breeding range estimated at 11,700,000 km (4,500,000 mi). Its population is unknown, but it is common in most of its range, and its numbers appear to be stable. It is therefore classed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Overgrazing, agriculture and the loss of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.

Although most rails in the Old World are covered by the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a> (AEWA), the African crake is not listed even in Kenya, where it is considered "near-threatened". Like its relative, the corn crake, it is too terrestrial to be classed as a wetland species.

Siege of Malakand

The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July – 2 August 1897 <a href="siege">siege</a> of the <a href="British%20Raj">British</a> garrison in the <a href="Malakand%20Agency">Malakand</a> region of colonial <a href="British%20India">British India</a>'s <a href="North-West%20Frontier%20Province%20%281901%E2%80%931955%29">North West Frontier Province</a>. The British faced a force of <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pashtun</a> tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the <a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a>, the 1,519 mile (2,445 km) border between <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="British%20India">British India</a> drawn up at the end of the <a href="Anglo-Afghan%20wars">Anglo-Afghan wars</a> to help hold back what the British feared to be the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>'s spread of influence towards the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>.

The unrest caused by this division of the Pashtun lands led to the rise of <a href="Saidullah">Saidullah</a>, a Pashtun <a href="fakir">fakir</a> who led an army of at least 10,000 against the British garrison in Malakand. Although the British forces were divided among a number of poorly defended positions, the small garrison at the camp of Malakand South and the small fort at <a href="Chakdara">Chakdara</a> were both able to hold out for six days against the much larger Pashtun army.

The siege was lifted when a relief column dispatched from British positions to the south was sent to assist General <a href="William%20Hope%20Meiklejohn">William Hope Meiklejohn</a>, commander of the British forces at Malakand South. Accompanying this relief force was second lieutenant <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who later published his account as "".

The rivalry between the <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>s, named "<a href="The%20Great%20Game">The Great Game</a>" by <a href="Arthur%20Conolly">Arthur Conolly</a>, centred on Afghanistan during the late 19th century. From the British perspective, Russian expansion threatened to destroy the so-called "jewel in the crown" of the British Empire, <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>. As the Tsar's troops in Central Asia began to subdue one <a href="Khanate">Khanate</a> after another, the British feared that Afghanistan would become a staging post for a Russian invasion. Against this background the British launched the <a href="First%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">First Anglo-Afghan War</a> in 1838, and attempted to impose a puppet regime under <a href="Shuja%20Shah">Shuja Shah</a>. The regime was short-lived, however, and unsustainable without British military support. After the Russians sent an uninvited <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a> to <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> in 1878, tensions were renewed and Britain demanded that the ruler of Afghanistan (<a href="Sher%20Ali%20Khan">Sher Ali Khan</a>) accept a British diplomatic mission. The mission was turned back and, in retaliation, a force of 40,000 men was sent across the border by the British, launching the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a>.

After reaching a virtual stalemate with these two wars against the <a href="Demographics%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghans</a>, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and <a href="British%20India">British India</a> (now the North-West Frontier Province, <a href="Federally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas">Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.)</a> and <a href="Balochistan%20%28Pakistan%29">Balochistan</a> provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir <a href="Mortimer%20Durand">Mortimer Durand</a>, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (<a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a>) and the representatives of the British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.
The British Malakand Field Force used the town of <a href="Nowshera%2C%20Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa">Nowshera</a> as a base of operations. Nowshera was located south of the <a href="Kabul%20River">Kabul River</a> "six hours by rail from Rawal Pindi". Commanded by Colonel Schalch, the base served as a hospital while the normal garrison was serving 47 miles (76 km) away at Malakand Pass in what was known as the Malakand South Camp. This force consisted of one British cavalry regiment, one Indian cavalry regiment and one Indian infantry battalion. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who would accompany the relief force as a second lieutenant and war correspondent, described the camp as "...a great cup, of which the rim is broken into numerous clefts and jagged points. At the bottom of this cup is the 'crater' camp." Churchill goes on to state that the camp was viewed as purely temporary and was indefensible, as a result of its cramped conditions and the fact that it was dominated by the surrounding heights. A nearby camp, North Malakand, was also established on the plains of Khar, intended to hold the large number of troops that were unable to fit into the main camp. Both of these positions were garrisoned for two years with little fear of attack by a 1,000 strong force. Officers brought their families, and the camp held regular <a href="polo">polo</a> matches and shooting competitions.

Towards 1897, news of unrest in the nearby Pashtun villages had reached the British garrisons in Malakand. <a href="Harold%20Arthur%20Deane">Major Deane</a>, the British political agent, noted the growing unrest within the Pashtun <a href="sepoy">sepoy</a>s stationed with the British. His warnings were officially distributed to senior officers on 23 July 1897; however, nothing more than a minor skirmish was expected. Rumours of a new religious leader, Saidullah the Sartor <a href="Fakir">Fakir</a> (also known as Mullah of Mastun), arriving to "sweep away" the British and inspire a <a href="jihad">jihad</a>, were reportedly circulating the <a href="bazaar">bazaar</a>s of Malakand during July. Saidullah became known to the British as "The Great Fakir", "Mad Fakir" or the "Mad Mullah", and by the Pashtuns as "lewanai faqir", or simply, "lewanai", meaning "god-intoxicated".

On July 26, while British officers were playing <a href="polo">polo</a> near camp Malakand North, indigenous spectators who were watching the match learned of an approaching Pashtun force and fled. Brigadier-General Meiklejohn, commander of the Malakand forces, was informed by Deane that "matters had assumed a very grave aspect" and that there were armed Pashtuns gathering nearby. Reinforcements from <a href="Mardan">Mardan</a> (32 miles (51 km) away) were requested, and Lieutenant P. Eliott-Lockhart departed at 1.30am. At 9.45pm, a final telegram was received informing the garrison that the Fakir had passed Khar and was advancing on Malakand. The telegram also stated that neither the levies nor the people would act against him, and that the hills to the east of the camp were covered with Pathans. Shortly after, the communication wire was cut.

During the night of 26 July, sometime after 10:00 pm, a messenger arrived with word that the enemy had reached the village of Khar, three miles from Malakand. A bugle call was immediately sounded within the camp. Lieutenant-Colonel McRae, commanding the <a href="45th%20Sikhs">45th Sikhs</a>, two units from the <a href="31st%20Punjab%20Infantry">31st Punjab Infantry</a>, two Guns from No. 8 Mountain Battery and one Squadron from the <a href="11th%20Bengal%20Lancers">11th Bengal Lancers</a>, was to have been sent to Amandara Pass – a distance of four miles – with orders to hold the position; however, the Pashtun column had already arrived at the South Malakand camp, surprising the British defenders, and began to open fire on the garrison with <a href="musket">musket</a>s. McRae immediately sent a small number of men under Major Taylor down a road from the "right flank" of the camp to ascertain the enemy's strength and location; McRae himself later followed with his own small group. Both parties aimed for a sharp turn in the oncoming road where, flanked by gorges, they hoped to hold the attacking force. McRae, with about 20 men, opened fire on the Pashtun tribesmen and began a fighting withdrawal 50 paces down the road before halting in an attempt to stop the attack. Taylor was mortally wounded in the incident and quickly died; McRae suffered a neck wound. Nevertheless, by 2:00 am reinforcements under the command of Lieutenant Barff had enabled the British to repel the Pashtun attack. The official dispatches of General Meiklejohn noted that:

"There is no doubt that the gallant resistance made by this small body in the gorge, against vastly superior numbers, till the arrival of the rest of the regiment, saved the camp from being rushed on that side, and I cannot speak too highly of the behaviour of Lieutenant-Colonel McRae and Major Taylor on this occasion."
Meanwhile, Pashtun forces had successfully assaulted the camp in three other locations, and the <a href="24th%20Punjab%20Infantry">24th Punjab Infantry</a>'s picket lines were quickly overrun. Pashtun sharpshooters occupying the nearby heights inflicted casualties throughout the night, and the bazaar and surrounding buildings were occupied. Other units of the 24th, under Lieutenant Climo, retook the area and held it until 10:45 pm, but under fire from sharpshooters they were driven back. The Pashtun forces broke through in a number of other locations. Lieutenant Watling commanding a group of British troops guarding the ammunitions stores at the Quarter Guard was wounded, losing the stores in the process. Meiklejohn led a small group of sappers, members of the 24th and Captain Holland, Climo from the earlier charge, and Lieutenant Manley to recapture the ammunition dump; Holland and the General were wounded, and the group severely depleted as it twice failed to retake the dump, but a third attempt proved successful. However, continuing crossfire from the enveloping Pashtun troops wounded a number of British officers, placing the command of the 24th with Climo. Towards 1:00 am on the morning of July 27, Lieutenant <a href="Edmund%20William%20Costello">Edmund William Costello</a> rescued a wounded <a href="havildar">havildar</a> while under fire and was later awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his actions.

As the night wore on, reinforcements arrived from a nearby British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces. At 4:15 pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The British had lost a large number of officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.

During the first night of the battle, the garrison at Malakand North had not seen much action despite being in the more exposed position, and had spent much of the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units. In response Meiklejohn ordered a reconnaissance of the vicinity, whereupon Major Gibbs, the commander of the force, encountered large groups of tribesmen in the valley. Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.

The last remaining forces from the now evacuated northern camp arrived in Malakand South at 8:30 am on the 27th, coinciding with the arrival of more Pashtun reinforcements. In Nowshera, the <a href="11th%20Bengal%20Lancers">11th Bengal Lancers</a> awoke to news describing the situation, and, together with the <a href="38th%20Dogras">38th Dogras</a>, the <a href="35th%20Sikhs">35th Sikhs</a>, No.1 and No.7 British Mountain Batteries, they set off to relieve the besieged garrison. Meanwhile, at Malakand South, fresh Pashtun attacks were repulsed by elements of the 24th led by Climo, whose unit captured a Pashtun standard.

At 7:30 pm the first of the British reinforcements arrived in the form of infantry from the <a href="Corps%20of%20Guides%20%28British%20India%29">Corps of Guides</a> under Lieutenant Lockhart. The <a href="45th%20Sikhs">45th Sikhs</a>, supported by 100 men from the Guides and two guns, remained astride the main road into the camp, while the <a href="31st%20Punjab%20Infantry">31st Punjab Infantry</a> held the centre; the 24th, under Climo, held the north edge of Malakand South. Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah of the 31st held the area around the bazaar, though the market place itself was left unoccupied. Around 8:00 pm the Pashtuns simultaneously attacked all the British positions where, "Many thousands of rounds were discharged" and a number of assaults repulsed. Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and his forces defended their position for several hours, however the Pashtuns were eventually successful in undermining the walls and killing the defenders. The surviving sepoys and their leader were awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>. The 24th also repelled a number of charges, with VC recipient Costello receiving a wound in the arm. Despite the constant harassment by musket fire, rifle fire and a barrage of rocks, Climo successfully led a counter-attack with two companies, pushing the attacking forces back two miles. The British records for the night of July 27 record 12 killed among the sepoy ranks, as well as the wounding of Costello.

The daylight hours of 28 July saw continuous fire from the Pashtun sharpshooters established in the hills surrounding Malakand South. The garrison surgeon, Lieutenant J.H. Hugo, treated a number of British casualties including an officer from the Guides. Despite further attacks during the night of July 28/29, the British recorded only two killed from the sepoy ranks, and the severe wounding of a Lieutenant Ford. Churchill records that Ford's bleeding artery was clamped shut by Hugo despite being under fire.

Having re-established communication on the morning of 29 July, the British garrison signalled the approaching relief forces via <a href="heliograph">heliograph</a> at 8:00 am – "Heavy fighting all night. Expect more tonight. What ammunition are you bringing? When may we expect you?" During the day, the Pashtuns prepared for another night attack while the British destroyed the bazaar and the regions previously defended, and lost, by Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and the men of the 31st. Trees were also cut down to improve fields of fire, attracting further attention from the Pashtun sharpshooters. Major Stuart Beatsen arrived at 4:00 pm on the 29th with the 11th Bengal Lancers who had been summoned from Nowshera two days previous. The 35th Sikhs and <a href="38th%20Dogras">38th Dogras</a> arrived at the mouth of the pass leading to Malakand South, but after losing between 19 and 21 of their ranks through heat exhaustion, they were forced to halt.

At 2:00 a.m. on 30 July, the Pashtuns launched another attack, during which Costello, and the Pashtun <a href="Mullah">Mullah</a>, were both wounded; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent. That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet charge of the <a href="45th%20Sikhs">45th Sikhs</a>. The following morning, on 31 July, the remainder of the 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid, bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291,600 rounds of ammunition. But with their attention now drawn towards the nearby British outpost of Chakdara, attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether. Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded, seven sepoy officers wounded, and 153 <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South.

On 28 July, when word of the attacks were received, a division of "6800 bayonets, 700 lances or sabres, with 24 guns" was given to Major-General <a href="Sir%20Bindon%20Blood">Sir Bindon Blood</a> with orders to hold "the
Malakand, and the adjacent posts, and of operating against the neighbouring tribes as may be required." Blood arrived at Nowshera on 31 July 1897 to take command, and on 1 August he was informed that the Pashtun forces had turned their attention to the nearby British fort of Chakdara. This was a small, under-garrisoned fort with few supplies that had itself been holding out with 200 men since the first attacks in Malakand began, and had recently sent the signal "Help us" to the British forces. Blood reached Malakand at noon on the same day. While Blood and his relief force marched for Chakdara from the main camp at Nowshera, Meiklejohn set out from Malakand South with the 45th, 24th and guns from No. 8 Battery. An advance force of Guides cavalry under Captain Baldwin met with an enemy force along the road and were forced to retreat with two British officers and one sepoy officer wounded and 16 other ranks killed or wounded.

Following this failed attempt, Blood arrived and appointed Reid commander of the forces at Malakand South, giving command of the rescue force to Meiklejohn. The rescue column of 1,000 infantry, two squadrons from the 11th Bengal Lancers, two of the Guides cavalry, 50 sappers, two cannons and a hospital detail, rested on the night of August 1, despite a night attack by Pashtun forces. On the following day, the relief force advanced along the road to the abandoned Malakand North in order to avoid fire from the Pashtun sharpshooters who still occupied the heights around the Malakand South "cup". With low morale, the relief force assembled at 4:30 am on 2 August; however, with the use of diversionary attacks, they were successful in breaking out of the Pashtun encirclement without loss. This led to confusion amongst the Pashtun forces, "like ants in a disturbed ant–hill" as observed Blood. The 11th Bengal Lancers and the Guides cavalry went on to relieve the threatened fort at Chakdara, while the 45th Sikhs stormed nearby Pashtun positions. The British recorded 33 casualties from the action on August 2.

The campaigns of the Malakand Field Force continued beyond the siege of Malakand South, North, and of the Chakdara fort. Immediately after the siege, two brigades of the British garrison were relocated to a new camp a few miles away to relieve the pressure in the overcrowded Malakand South. These received only light fire during 5 August 1897; however, on 8 August, Saidullah rallied his surviving Pashtun forces and attacked the British garrison at Shabkadr fort near <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>. These attacks put the continued loyalty of friendly Pashtun levies guarding the British supply lines to <a href="Chitral">Chitral</a> at risk, thus endangering the supply convoys and their small escorts. In response, on 14 August, the British advanced farther into Pashtun territory and engaged a force of "several thousand" Pashtun tribesmen, with General Meiklejohn leading a flanking manoeuvre which split the Pashtun army in two, forcing it to pull back to <a href="Lower%20Swat%20Valley">Landakai</a>. The British continued to engage Pashtun tribesmen throughout the day, suffering two officers and 11 other ranks killed.

The siege of Malakand was Winston Churchill's first experience of actual combat, which he later described in several columns for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", receiving <a href="GBP">£</a>5 per column; these articles were eventually compiled into his first published book, "The Story of the Malakand Field Force", beginning his career as a writer and politician. Of the book's publication he remarked, "[it] will certainly be the most noteworthy act of my life. Up to date (of course). By its reception I shall measure the chances of my possible success in the world." Of the siege of Malakand, and of the entire campaign against the Pashtun tribes in northern India, Churchill remarked that they were a period of significant "transition".

The <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> authorized the award of the clasp "Malakand 1897" to the <a href="India%20Medal">India Medal</a> for those of the <a href="British%20Army">British</a> and <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian</a> armies who participated in this action. The battleground remained closed to visitors and under military control since the publication of Churchill's memoirs, and is the location of a Pakistani military base. However, in 2006 the Pakistani government began opening the area to foreign visitors.

Fanny Imlay

Frances "Fanny" Imlay (14 May 1794 – 9 October 1816), also known as Fanny Godwin and Frances Wollstonecraft, was the daughter, <a href="Legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29%23History">born out of wedlock</a>, of the British feminist <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and the American commercial speculator and diplomat <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a>. Wollstonecraft wrote about her frequently in her later works. Fanny grew up in the household of anarchist political philosopher <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, the widower of her mother, with his second wife and their combined family of five children. Fanny's half-sister <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary</a> grew up to write "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" and married <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, a leading <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet, who composed a poem on Fanny's death.

Although Gilbert Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft lived together happily for brief periods before and after the birth of Fanny, he left Wollstonecraft in France in the midst of <a href="French%20Revolution">the Revolution</a>. In an attempt to revive their relationship, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia on business for him, taking the one-year-old Fanny with her, but the affair never rekindled. After falling in love with and marrying Godwin, Wollstonecraft died soon after giving birth in 1797, leaving the three-year-old Fanny in the hands of Godwin, along with their newborn daughter Mary.

Four years later, Godwin remarried and his new wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought two children of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—<a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.

Fanny Imlay was the daughter of the British <a href="feminist">feminist</a> writer <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and the American entrepreneur <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a>. Both had moved to France during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, Wollstonecraft to practise the principles laid out in her seminal work "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792) and Imlay to engage in speculative business ventures. The two met and fell in love. At one point during Wollstonecraft and Imlay's relationship, the couple could meet only at a tollbooth between <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Neuilly-sur-Seine">Neuilly</a>, and it was there that their daughter was conceived; Fanny was therefore, in Godwin's words, a "barrier child". Frances "Fanny" Imlay, Wollstonecraft's first child, was born in <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> on 14 May 1794, or, as the birth certificate stated, on the 25th day of <a href="Flor%C3%A9al">Floreal</a> in the Second Year of the Republic, and named after <a href="Fanny%20Blood">Fanny Blood</a>, her mother's closest friend. Although Imlay never married Wollstonecraft, he registered her as his wife at the American consulate to protect her once <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Britain and France went to war</a> in February 1793. Most people, including Wollstonecraft's sisters, assumed they were married—and thus, by extension, that Fanny was legitimate—and she was registered as such in France.

Initially, the couple's life together was idyllic. Wollstonecraft playfully wrote to one friend: "My little Girl begins to suck so "manfully" that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman" [emphasis in original]. Imlay soon tired of Wollstonecraft and domestic life and left her for long periods of time. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances—alone with an infant in the middle of the French Revolution.

Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; the next month she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region during <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">a time of war</a>, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she returned to England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, where a stranger rescued her.

Using her diaries and letters from her journey to Scandinavia, Wollstonecraft wrote a rumination on her travels and her relationship—"<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" (1796)—in which, among other things, she celebrated motherhood. Her maternal connection to her daughter prompted her to reflect on a woman's place in the world:
You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her—I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard—I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit—Hapless woman! what a fate is thine!
Wollstonecraft lavished love and attention on her daughter. She began two books, drawn from her own experience, related to Fanny's care: a parenting manual entitled "Letters on the Management of Infants" and a reading primer entitled "Lessons". In one section of "Lessons", she describes <a href="weaning">weaning</a>:
When you were hungry, you began to cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It was not long before another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.
In 1797, Wollstonecraft fell in love with and married the philosopher <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> (she had become pregnant with his child). Godwin grew to love Fanny during his affair with Wollstonecraft; he brought her back a mug from <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood">Josiah Wedgwood's</a> pottery factory with an "F" on it that delighted both mother and daughter. Wollstonecraft died in September of the same year, from complications giving birth to <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin</a>, who survived. Three-year-old Fanny, who had been scarred from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, was unofficially adopted by her stepfather and given the name of Godwin. Her copy of Wollstonecraft's only completed children's book, "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788), has the initials "F. G." written in large print in it. According to the dominant interpretation of Godwin's diary, it was not until Fanny turned twelve that she was informed in an important conversation with Godwin that he was not her natural father. In the only biography of Fanny, <a href="Janet%20Todd">Janet Todd</a> disputes this reading, arguing instead that the conversation was about Fanny's future. She finds it unlikely that Fanny would have been unaware of her origins in the open and liberal Godwin household.

After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin and <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, Wollstonecraft's publisher and close friend, contacted Fanny's father, but he was uninterested in raising his child. (Neither Wollstonecraft nor her daughter ever saw Gilbert Imlay after 1796.) Wollstonecraft's two sisters, Eliza Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft, Fanny's only two living female relatives, were anxious to care for her; Godwin, disliking them, turned down their offer. Several times throughout Fanny's childhood Wollstonecraft's sisters asked Godwin to allow them to raise their niece and each time he refused. Godwin himself did not seem particularly ready for parenthood and he now had two small children to raise and no steady source of income. However, he was determined to care for them. During these early years of Fanny's life, Joseph Johnson served as an "unofficial trustee" for her as he had occasionally for her mother. He even willed her <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>200, but Godwin owed Johnson so much money upon his death in 1809 that Johnson's heirs demanded Godwin pay the money back as part of his arrears.

Although Godwin was fond of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care for them. As Todd explains, he was constantly annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, when he took a trip to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.
On 21 December 1801, when Fanny was seven, Godwin married Mary Jane Clairmont, a neighbour with two children of her own: three-year-old <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire</a> and six-year-old Charles. She had never been married and was looking, like Godwin, for financial stability. Although Clairmont was well-educated and well-travelled, most of Godwin's friends despised her, finding her vulgar and dishonest. They were astonished that Godwin could replace Mary Wollstonecraft with her. Fanny and her half-sister Mary disliked their stepmother and complained that she preferred her own children to them. On 28 March 1803, baby William was born to the couple.

Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did not agree with her that women should receive the same education as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer's</a> "<a href="Fabulous%20Histories">Fabulous Histories</a>" (1786) and <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld's</a> "<a href="Lessons%20for%20Children">Lessons for Children</a>" (1778–79), but, according to Todd, he did not take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny. William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in "<a href="The%20Enquirer%20%28Godwin%29">The Enquirer</a>" reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now <a href="Margaret%20King">Lady Mountcashell</a>, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that "everything we know about his daughter's [Mary's and presumably Fanny's] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager". Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music. Despite Godwin's <a href="atheism">atheism</a>, all of the children were taken to an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> church.

The Godwins were constantly in debt, so Godwin returned to writing to support the family. He and his wife started a "Juvenile Library" for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more money than they could afford from generous friends such as publisher <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> and Godwin devotee <a href="Francis%20Place">Francis Place</a>.

As Fanny Imlay grew up, her father increasingly relied on her to placate tradespeople who demanded bills be paid and to solicit money from men such as Place. According to Todd and Seymour, Imlay believed in Godwin's theory that great thinkers and artists should be supported by patrons and she believed Godwin to be both a great novelist and a great philosopher. Throughout her life, she wrote letters asking Place and others for money to support Godwin's "genius" and she helped run the household so that he could work.

Godwin, never one to mince words, wrote about the differences he perceived between his two daughters:

My own daughter [Mary] is considerably superior in capacity to the one her mother had before. Fanny, the eldest, is of a quiet, modest, unshowy disposition, somewhat given to indolence, which is her greatest fault, but sober, observing, peculiarly clear and distinct in the faculty of memory, and disposed to exercise her own thoughts and follow her own judgment. Mary, my daughter, is the reverse of her in many particulars. She is singularly bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire for knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes is almost invincible. My own daughter is, I believe, very pretty; Fanny is by no means handsome, but in general prepossessing.
The intellectual world of the girls was widened by their exposure to the literary and political circles in which Godwin moved. For example, during former American vice-president <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr's</a> self-imposed exile from the United States after his acquittal on treason charges, he often spent time with the Godwins. He greatly admired the works of Wollstonecraft and had educated his daughter according to the precepts of "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>". He was anxious to meet the daughters of the woman he revered and referred to Fanny, Mary, and Claire as "goddesses". He spent most of his time talking with Imlay about political and educational topics. Burr was impressed by the <a href="Bell-Lancaster%20method">Lancastrian</a> teaching method and took Fanny to see a model school in 1811.

It was not Burr, but the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet and writer <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> who had the greatest impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>", Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.

In 1814, Shelley spent a considerable amount of time at the Godwins' and he and Imlay may have fallen in love. Later, <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a> claimed that they had been. Imlay was sent to <a href="Wales">Wales</a> in May of that year; Todd speculates that Godwin was trying to separate her from Shelley while Seymour hints that Mrs Godwin was trying to improve her despondent mood. Meanwhile, the Godwin household became even more uncomfortable as Godwin sank further into debt and as relations between Mary and her stepmother became increasingly hostile. Mary Godwin consoled herself with Shelley and the two started a passionate love affair. When Shelley declared to Godwin that the two were in love, Godwin exploded in anger. However, he needed the money that Shelley, as an aristocrat, could and was willing to provide. Frustrated with the entire situation, Mary Godwin, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont ran off to Europe together on 28 June 1814. Godwin hurriedly summoned Imlay home from Wales to help him handle the situation. Her stepmother wrote that Imlay's "emotion was deep when she heard of the sad fate of the two girls; she cannot get over it". In the middle of this disaster, one of Godwin's protégés killed himself, and young William Godwin ran away from home and was missing for two days. When news of the girls' escapade became public, Godwin was pilloried in the press. Life in the Godwin household became increasingly strained.

When Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and Shelley returned from the Continent in September 1814, they took a house together in London, enraging Godwin still further. Imlay felt pulled between the two households: she felt loyal both to her sisters and to her father. Both despised her decision not to choose a side in the family drama. As Seymour explains, Imlay was in a difficult position: the Godwin household felt Shelley was a dangerous influence and the Shelley household ridiculed her fear of violating social conventions. Also, her aunts were considering her for a teaching position at this time, but were reluctant because of Godwin's shocking "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). Seymour writes, the "few timid visits Fanny made to see Mary and [Claire] in London were acts of great courage; she got little thanks for them". Although instructed by Godwin not to speak to Shelley and her sisters, Imlay warned them of creditors who knew of Shelley's return (he also was in debt). Her attempts to persuade Clairmont to return to the Godwins' convinced Shelley that she was of Godwin's party and he began to distrust her. Imlay was also still responsible for soliciting money from Shelley in order to repay her father's debts; despite Shelley's essential elopement with two of his daughters, Godwin agreed to accept £1,200 from Shelley. When Mary Godwin gave birth to a daughter in February 1815, she immediately sent for Imlay, particularly as both she and the infant were ill. Godwin chastised Imlay for disobeying his orders not to see her half-sister and her misery increased. After the death of the child, Imlay paid more frequent visits to the couple.

Soon after, Clairmont became a lover of the Romantic poet <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a>. Godwin's debts continued to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with the tension in the Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.

Amidst all of this family turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The <a href="utopian%20socialist">utopian socialist</a> <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a> came to visit Godwin in the summer of 1816 and he and Imlay discussed the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet her for the first time and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to "such a mother"... I have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's to love and esteem me" [emphasis in original].

Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley had left for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major argument and no chance to come to a reconciliation. Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London was palpable. She wrote to Mary of "the dreadful state of mind I generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of". Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her. Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same "extreme depression to which her mother had been subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family". Wandering amongst the mountains of <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, frustrated with her relationship with Shelley, and engrossed by the writing of "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", her sister was unsympathetic.

The group returned from the Continent, with a pregnant Clairmont, and settled in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> (to protect her reputation, they attempted to hide the pregnancy). Imlay saw Shelley twice in September 1816; according to Todd's interpretation of Fanny's letters, Fanny had earlier tried to solicit an invitation to join the group in Europe and she repeated these appeals when she saw Shelley in London. Todd believes that Imlay begged to be allowed to stay with them because life in Godwin's house was unbearable, with the constant financial worries and Mrs Godwin's insistent haranguing, and that Shelley refused, concerned with anyone learning about Clairmont's condition, most of all someone he believed might inform Godwin (Shelley was being sued by his wife and was worried about his own reputation). After Shelley left, Todd explains that Imlay wrote to Mary "to make clear again her longing to be rescued".

In early October 1816, Imlay left Godwin's house in London and committed suicide on 9 October by taking an overdose of <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> at an inn in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, Wales; she was 22. The details surrounding her death and her motivations are disputed. Most of the letters regarding the incident were destroyed or are missing. In his 1965 article "Fanny Godwin's Suicide Re-examined", B. R. Pollin lays out the major theories that had been put forward regarding her suicide and which continue to be used today:
Pollin dismisses the first of these, as have most later biographers, arguing that Imlay had access to her mother's writings and Godwin's "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" which openly discuss the circumstances of her birth. Imlay herself even makes this distinction in letters to her half-sister Mary Godwin.

Pollin is also sceptical of the second explanation, pointing to Imlay's letter to Mary of 3 October 1816 in which she defended her step-mother: "Mrs. Godwin would never do either of you a deliberate injury. Mamma and I are not great friends, but always alive to her virtues, I am anxious to defend her from a charge so foreign to her character."

Pollin finds no evidence that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been "in contemplation", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility. St Clair claims that Imlay was on her way to join her maternal aunts in Ireland when she decided to commit suicide. He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to see if she could be a teacher in their school. Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.

In his survey of the letters of the Godwins and the Shelleys, Pollin comes to the conclusion that Imlay was not depressive. She is frequently described as happy and looking toward the future and describes herself this way. The mentions of melancholia and sadness are specific and related to particular events and illness. Richard Holmes, in his biography of Percy Shelley, argues that "her agonizing and loveless suspension between the Godwin and Shelley households was clearly the root circumstance" of her suicide. Locke argues that "most probably because she could absorb no more of the miseries of Skinner Street, her father's inability to pay his debts or write his books, her mother's unending irritability and spitefulness", all of which she blamed on herself, she committed suicide.

Pollin largely agrees with Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> and he "somehow failed her", causing her to commit suicide. Seymour and others speculate that Shelley's only failure was to live up to his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by those who have the worth to give". Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's <a href="Bone%20%28corsetry%29">stays</a>, which were embroidered with the initials "M.W.", and the nicest clothes she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.

On the night of 9 October, Imlay checked into the Mackworth Arms Inn in Swansea and instructed the chambermaid not to disturb her. The same night Mary Godwin, staying in Bath with Shelley, received a letter Imlay had mailed earlier from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. Her father in London also received a letter. The alarming nature of the letters prompted both Godwin and Shelley to set out for Bristol at once (although they travelled separately). By the time they tracked her to Swansea on 11 October, they were too late. Imlay was found dead in her room on 10 October, having taken a fatal dose of laudanum, and it was only Shelley who stayed to deal with the situation. Imlay left behind an unaddressed note, describing herself as "unfortunate", perhaps referring to Mary Wollstonecraft's description of her as "my unfortunate girl" in the note she wrote on "Lessons" before she herself attempted suicide:

I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an end to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate, and whose life has only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurt their health in endeavouring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear of my death will give you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that such a creature ever existed as

The note appears to have originally been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could not be identified. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, "The Cambrian", therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.

At the <a href="Inquest%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">inquest</a>, Imlay was declared "dead", rather than a suicide or an insanity victim, which saved her body from various indignities. Todd speculates that Shelley arranged for Imlay to be declared "dead" (an appellation more common for the well-to-do) and removed any identifying items, such as her name on the note. She also concludes that to protect the rest of the family, he refused to claim her body. No one else claimed Imlay's body and it was probably buried in a pauper's grave. In fact, Godwin wrote to Percy Shelley:

Do nothing to destroy the obscurity she so much desired, that now rests upon the event. It was, as I said, her last wish ... Think what is the situation of my wife & myself, now deprived of all our children but the youngest [William]; & do not expose us to those idle questions, which to a mind in anguish is one of the severest trials.

We are at this moment in doubt whether during the first shock we shall not say she is gone to Ireland to her aunts, a thing that had been in contemplation ... What I have most of all in horror is the public papers; & I thank you for your caution as it might act on this.

Because suicide was considered scandalous, disreputable, and sinful at the time, which might have damaged Godwin's business, the family told various stories regarding Imlay's death in order to cover up the truth, including that she had gone on vacation, that she had died of a cold in Wales, that she had died of an "inflammatory fever", that she was living with her mother's sisters, or, if forced to admit suicide, that Imlay killed herself because Shelley loved Mary Godwin and not her. Neither Percy nor Mary mention Imlay's death in their surviving letters from this time. Claire Clairmont claimed in a letter to Byron that Percy became ill because of her death, but as Holmes notes, there is no other evidence for this assertion. Yet Locke writes that Shelley told Byron he felt "a far severer anguish" over Imlay's suicide than over Harriet's (his wife's) suicide just two months later.

While there is no known image of Imlay, a few months after her death, Shelley penned the poem quoted at the beginning of this article. As Seymour writes, "[p]ublished by Mary without comment, it has always been supposed to allude to his last meeting with her half-sister."

The Disasters of War

The Disasters of War (Spanish: Los desastres de la guerra) is a series of 82 <a href="old%20master%20print">prints</a> created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and <a href="Printmaking">printmaker</a> <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a> (1746–1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 <a href="Dos%20de%20Mayo%20Uprising">Dos de Mayo Uprising</a>, the subsequent <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> of 1808–14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</a> in 1814. During the conflicts between <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a> and Spain, Goya retained his position as first <a href="court%20painter">court painter</a> to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers. Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath. He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons. In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most <a href="print%20room">print room</a> collections have at least some of the set.

The name by which the series is known today is not Goya's own. His handwritten title on an album of <a href="Artist%27s%20proof">proofs</a> given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks from a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.
The series was produced using a variety of <a href="Intaglio%20%28printmaking%29">intaglio printmaking</a> techniques, mainly <a href="etching">etching</a> for the line work and <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a> for the tonal areas, but also <a href="engraving">engraving</a> and <a href="drypoint">drypoint</a>. As with many other Goya prints, they are sometimes referred to as aquatints, but more often as etchings. The series is usually considered in three groups which broadly mirror the order of their creation. The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811–12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201812">Spanish Constitution of 1812</a> and opposed both state and religious reform. Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the "prodigious flowering of rage" The serial nature in which the plates unfold has led some to see the images as similar in nature to photography.

<a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I of France</a> declared himself <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> of the <a href="French%20Republic">French Republic</a> on 18 February 1799, and was crowned Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, it was politically and strategically important to the French. The reigning Spanish sovereign, <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV</a>, was internationally regarded as ineffectual, and his position at the time was threatened by his pro-British heir, <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Crown Prince Ferdinand</a>. Napoleon took advantage of Charles's weak standing by suggesting the two nations conquer Portugal—the spoils to be divided equally between France, Spain and the Spanish Prime Minister, <a href="Manuel%20de%20Godoy">Manuel de Godoy</a>, who would take the title "Prince of the <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a>". Seduced by the French offer, Godoy accepted, failing to detect the true motivations of either Napoleon or Ferdinand, who both intended to use the invasion as a ploy, to seize power in Spain.

Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas. In 1808, <a href="Mutiny%20of%20Aranjuez">a popular uprising</a>—incited by Ferdinand's supporters—saw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to <a href="abdication">abdicate</a>; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage, but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive and competent than the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a>. They decided that Napoleon's brother, <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a>, should be king. Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.
Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.

Several of Goya's friends, including the poets <a href="Juan%20Mel%C3%A9ndez%20Vald%C3%A9s">Juan Meléndez Valdés</a> and <a href="Leandro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Morat%C3%ADn">Leandro Fernández de Moratín</a>, were overt : the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Wellington</a> from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for "The Disasters of War". He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as ""—the dismemberment of Spain.

Art historians broadly agree that "The Disasters of War" is divided into three thematic groupings—war, famine, and political and cultural allegories. This sequence broadly reflects the order in which the plates were created. Few of the plates or drawings are dated; instead, their chronology has been established by identifying specific incidents to which the plates refer, and the different batches of plates used, which allow sequential groups to be divined. For the most part, Goya's numbering agrees with these other methods. However, there are several exceptions. For example, was among the last to be completed, after the end of the war.

In the early plates of the war grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images typically show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, the distinction between the Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, "Con razon ó sin ella" can mean "with or without reason", "rightly or wrongly", or "for something or for nothing". Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime". There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.
Plates 1 to 47 consist mainly of realistic depictions of the horrors of the war fought against the French. Most portray the aftermath of battle; they include mutilated torsos and limbs mounted on trees, like "fragments of marble sculpture". Both French and Spanish troops tortured and mutilated captives; evidence of such acts is minutely detailed across a number of Goya's plates. Civilian death is also captured in detail. Spanish women were commonly victims of assault and rape. Civilians often followed armies to battle scenes. If their side won, women and children would search the battlefield for their husbands, fathers and sons. If they lost, they fled in fear of being raped or murdered. In , "No quieren" ("They do not want to"), an elderly woman is shown wielding a knife in defence of a young woman who is being assaulted by a soldier.

The group begins with "" ("Gloomy presentiments of what must come to pass"), in which a man kneels in the darkness with outstretched arms. The following plates describe combat with the French, who—according to art critic Vivien Raynor—are depicted "rather like <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, bayoneting civilians", while Spanish civilians are shown "poleaxing the French." Plates 31 to 39 focus on atrocities and were produced on the same batch of plates as the famine group. Others are based on drawings Goya had completed in his "Sketchbook-journal", in studies where he examined the theme of the grotesque body in relation to the iconography of the tortured or martyred one. In his India ink wash drawing "We cannot look at this" (1814–24), he examined the idea of a humiliated inverted body with pathos and tragedy, as he did to comical effect in "" (1791–92).

Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's rejects the ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on individual participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots. The exception is , "Que valor!" ("What courage!"), which depicts <a href="Agustina%20de%20Arag%C3%B3n">Agustina de Aragón</a> (1786–1857), the heroine of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, who brought food to the <a href="cannon">cannon</a>eers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000 Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself. Although it is agreed that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes it may have been his visit to Zaragoza in the lull between the <a href="Siege%20of%20Saragossa%20%281808%29">first</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Saragossa%20%281809%29">second</a> phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.
The second group, plates 48 to 64, detail the effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Wellington</a>'s armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year. In these plates, Goya's focus is directed away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food.

Goya does not focus on the reasons for the shortage, nor does he apportion blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , "Madre infeliz!" ("Unhappy mother!"), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents "a darkness that seems to be the very essence of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a> in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were <a href="Burnishing%20%28metal%29">burnish</a>ed.
Plates 65 to 82 were named "caprichos enfáticos" ("emphatic <a href="Capriccio%20%28painting%29">caprices</a>") in the original series title. Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII's fall and return to power, they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post-war Spanish politics, including the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Inquisition</a> and the then-common judicial practice of torture. Although peace was welcomed, it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before. The new regime stifled the hopes of liberals such as Goya, who used the term "fatal consequences" to describe the situation in his title for the series. Hughes refers to the group as the "disasters of peace".

After the six years of <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolutism</a> that followed Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, <a href="Rafael%20del%20Riego">Rafael del Riego</a> initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201812">1812 Constitution</a>. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after <a href="Trienio%20Liberal">an unstable period</a>, a <a href="Hundred%20Thousand%20Sons%20of%20Saint%20Louis">French invasion</a> supported by <a href="Quintuple%20Alliance">an alliance of the major powers</a> had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.

Many of these images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier "<a href="Caprichos">Caprichos</a>". "Farándula de charlatanes" ("Troupe of charlatans") shows a priest with a parrot's head performing before an audience of donkeys and monkeys. In , a pope walking a tightrope was "prudently reduced" to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863. Some prints showing animal scenes seem to draw from a satirical verse fable by <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Casti">Giovanni Battista Casti</a>, published in Italian in 1802; the "<a href="Animal%20Farm">Animal Farm</a>" of its day. In plate 74, the wolf, representing a minister, quotes from the fable—"Miserable humanity, the fault is thine"—and signs with Casti's name. The print "lays the blame for their rulers' barbarity on the victims' own acceptance of it".
A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a> of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and <a href="procession">procession</a>al images, are mocked and denigrated. , "Esta no lo es menos" ("This is no less curious"), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the "Virgin of Solitude". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, "It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations." Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were "illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form".

The published edition of "The Disasters of War" ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a <a href="wreath">wreath</a>, intended as a personification of <a href="Allegory%20of%20Hispania">Spain</a>, Truth, or the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201812">Constitution of 1812</a>—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In , "Murió la Verdad" ("The Truth has died"), she lies dead. In , "Si resucitará?" ("Will she live again?"), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of "monks and monsters". In plate 82, "Esto es lo verdadero" ("This is the true way"), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.
Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, mostly in <a href="Sanguine">red chalk</a>, have survived and are numbered differently from the published prints. He produced two albums of proofs—among many individual proof impressions—of which only one is complete. The full album consists of 85 works, including three small "Prisioneros" ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which are not part of the series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, to his friend <a href="Juan%20Agust%C3%ADn%20Ce%C3%A1n%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez</a>. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier—who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain—to the <a href="Real%20Academia%20de%20Bellas%20Artes%20de%20San%20Fernando">Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando</a> (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director. Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.

As the series progressed, Goya evidently began to experience shortages of good quality paper and copper plates, and was forced to take what art historian <a href="Juliet%20Wilson-Bareau">Juliet Wilson-Bareau</a> calls the "drastic step" of destroying two depicting landscapes, from which very few impressions had been printed. These were cut in half to produce four of "The Disasters of War"s prints. Partly because of the material shortages, the sizes and shapes of the plates vary somewhat, ranging from as small as 142 × 168 mm (5.6 × 6.6 in) to as large as 163 × 260 mm (6.4 × 10.2 in).

Goya completed 56 plates during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">war against France</a>, and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch—including plate 1, several in the middle of the series, and the last 17 plates—are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: "I saw this" () and "One can not look" (). While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand. It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on <a href="Copper%20engraving">copper plate</a> once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches. All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.

The titles of a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes themselves are not related. Examples include plates and ("With or without reason" and "The same"), and ("The women are courageous" and "And they are fierce"), and , and ("They do not want to", "Nor these" and "Or these"). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates and ("This is bad" and "This is how it happened"), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.

The Bermúdez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed, one plate had work added, and the printing was carried out with much more ink on the plates (producing "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste. The Bermúdez set is considered "uniquely important ... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed". There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small "Prisioneros").

"The Disasters of War" was not published during Goya's lifetime, possibly because he feared political repercussions from Fernando VII's repressive regime. Some art historians suggest that he did not publish because he was sceptical about the use of images for political motives, and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release. Most, however, believe the artist preferred to wait until they could be made public without censorship. A further four editions were published, the last in 1937, so that in total over 1,000 impressions of each print have been printed, though not all of the same quality. As with his other series, later impressions show wear to the aquatint. The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937. Many sets have been broken up, and most <a href="print%20room">print room</a> collections will have at least some of the set. Examples, especially from later editions, are available on the art market.

In 1873, Spanish novelist <a href="Antonio%20de%20Trueba">Antonio de Trueba</a> published the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on the genesis of the series. de Trueba claims to have spoken to Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of <a href="Principe%20Pio">Principe Pio</a> to sketch the victims of the <a href="The%20Third%20of%20May%201808">executions of 3 May 1808</a>. Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a "romantic fantasy", and detailed its many inaccuracies.
Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a> to <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s "<a href="Guernica%20%28painting%29">Guernica</a>" (1937). Reflecting on "The Disasters of War", biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth "be seen and ... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it ... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a> with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like <a href="Hans%20Baldung">Hans Baldung</a>. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by <a href="Jacques%20Callot">Jacques Callot</a> known as "<a href="Les%20Grandes%20Mis%C3%A8res%20de%20la%20guerre">Les Grandes Misères de la guerre</a>" (1633), which record the devastating impact on <a href="Lorraine%20%28region%29">Lorraine</a> of <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII</a>'s troops during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>.

The dead man in plate 37, "<a href="This%20is%20worse">Esto es peor</a>" ("This is worse"), forms a mutilated body of a Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers. It is based in part on the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> fragment of a male nude, the "<a href="Belvedere%20Torso">Belvedere Torso</a>" by the Athenian "Apollonios son of Nestor". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In "Esto es peor" he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre – the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing. The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, during the time of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. Art critic <a href="Robert%20Hughes%20%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a> remarked that the figures in this image "remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like <a href="Anton%20Raphael%20Mengs">Menges</a> would have been in aesthetic raptures over them."

Goya abandons colour in the series, believing that light, shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, "In art there is no need for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait." He uses line not so much to delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, "to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste ... This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged." The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature. He was not the first to work in this manner; <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> had sought a similar directness, but did not have access to aquatint. <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a> and <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, contemporaries of Goya's, produced works with similarly fantastical content, but, as Hollander describes, they muted its disturbing impact with "exquisitely applied linearity ... lodging it firmly in the safe citadels of beauty and rhythm."

In his 1947 book on Goya's etchings, English author <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> observed that the images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes: darkened archways "more sinister than those even of <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Piranesi">Piranesi</a>'s "Prisons""; street corners as settings for the cruelty of the disparities of class; and silhouetted hilltops carrying the dead, sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses. "And so the record proceeds, horror after horror, unalleviated by any of the splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war; for, significantly, Goya never illustrates an engagement, never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in the order of battle ... All he shows us is war's disasters and squalors, without any of the glory or even picturesqueness."

"The Disasters of War" is the second of Goya's four major print series, which constitute almost all of his most important work in the medium. He also created 35 prints early in his career—many of which are reproductions of his portraits and other works—and about 16 <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a>s while living in France. His first series, the 80-plate "<a href="Caprichos">Caprichos</a>", were completed between 1797 and 1799 to document "the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and ... the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual." "Caprichos" was put on sale in 1799, but was almost immediately withdrawn after threats from the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. In "The Disasters of War"s first two groups of prints, Goya largely departs from the imaginative, synthetic approach of "Caprichos" to realistically depict life-and-death scenes of war. In the last group, the "Caprichos" sense of the fantastic returns.

Between 1815 and 1816, Goya produced the "<a href="La%20Tauromaquia">Tauromachia</a>", a series of 33 <a href="bullfighting">bullfighting</a> scenes, during a break from "The Disasters of War". "Tauromachia" was not politically sensitive, and was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320—for sale individually or in sets—without incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success. While in France, Goya completed a set of four larger lithographs, "" ("The Bulls of Bordeaux"). His final series, known as "<a href="Los%20Disparates">Los Disparates</a>" ("The Follies"), "Proverbios" ("Proverbs"), or "Sueños" ("Dreams"), contains 22 large plates and at least five drawings that are seemingly part of the series but which were never etched. All these were left in Madrid—apparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed—when Goya went to France in 1823. One plate is known to have been etched in 1816, but little else is established about the chronology of the works, or Goya's plans for the set.

Goya worked on "The Disasters of War" during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to the imagery of the "Caprichos". In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.

In "The Disasters of War", Goya does not excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the consolation of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This in part a result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.

The plates are set spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the picture plane in all directions. Thus, they express the randomness of violence, and in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th- and 20th-century <a href="photojournalism">photojournalism</a>. According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier "Caprichos" series, "The Disasters of War" is likely to have been intended as a "social speech"; satires on the then prevailing "hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [and] the absence of wisdom" of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition. It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believed Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness.

His message late in life is contrary to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying that violence is innate in man, "forged in the substance of what, since <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freud</a>, we have called the <a href="id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego">id</a>." Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of <a href="The%20Dog%20%28Goya%29">Goya's dog</a>, "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya."

"The Disasters of War" plates are preoccupied with wasted bodies, undifferentiated body parts, castration and female abjection. There are dark erotic undertones to a number of the works. Connell notes the innate sexuality of the image in plate 7—<a href="Agustina%20de%20Arag%C3%B3n">Agustina de Aragón</a>'s igniting a long cannon. The art historian Lennard Davis suggests that Goya was fascinated with the "erotics of dismemberment", while Hughes mentions in "Los disparates", which shows a woman carried in the grip of a horse's mouth. To Hughes, the woman's euphoria suggests, among other possible meanings, orgasm.

Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, "The Disasters of War" had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's <a href="Real%20Academia%20de%20Bellas%20Artes%20de%20San%20Fernando">Royal Academy of San Fernando</a> in 1863.
Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-<a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20G%C3%A9ricault">Théodore Géricault</a>, best known for the politically charged "<a href="The%20Raft%20of%20the%20Medusa">Raft of the Medusa</a>" (1818–19). <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a> identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 "<a href="L%27Age%20d%27Or">L'Âge d'Or</a>", on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 "<a href="The%20Exterminating%20Angel%20%28film%29">The Exterminating Angel</a>".

The series' impact on Dalí is evident in "<a href="Soft%20Construction%20with%20Boiled%20Beans%20%28Premonition%20of%20Civil%20War%29">Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)</a>", painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of , "Grande hazaña! Con muertos!" ("A heroic feat! With dead men!"), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.

In 1993, <a href="Jake%20and%20Dinos%20Chapman">Jake and Dinos Chapman</a> of the <a href="Young%20British%20Artists">Young British Artists</a> movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on "The Disasters of War". The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the <a href="Tate">Tate</a> gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate "Grande hazaña! Con muertos!".
In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of "The Disasters of War". They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads. The Chapmans described their "rectified" images as making a connection between Napoleon's supposed introduction of <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> ideals to early-19th-century Spain and <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> purporting to <a href="Rationale%20for%20the%20Iraq%20War%23Bringing%20democracy%20to%20the%20Middle%20East">bring democracy to Iraq</a>.

Red-capped robin

The red-capped robin ("Petroica goodenovii") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits <a href="shrubland">scrub</a> and open <a href="woodland">woodland</a>. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family <a href="Petroicidae">Petroicidae</a>, it is <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>. Measuring in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">advertise territories</a> and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.

The position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to <a href="European%20robin">European</a> or <a href="American%20robin">American</a> robins but appear to be an early offshoot of the <a href="songbird">songbird</a> infraorder <a href="Passerida">Passerida</a>. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird and its prey consists of <a href="insect">insect</a>s and <a href="spider">spider</a>s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.

The red-capped robin was described by <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> in 1827, having been collected in the northern <a href="Spencer%20Gulf">Spencer Gulf</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. They named it "Muscicapa goodenovii", and placed it among the <a href="Old%20World%20flycatcher">Old World flycatcher</a> family <a href="Muscicapidae">Muscicapidae</a>. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "goodenovii" honours the Reverend <a href="Samuel%20Goodenough">Samuel Goodenough</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Carlisle">Bishop of Carlisle</a> and first treasurer of the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society</a>.

The red-capped robin was later moved to the genus "<a href="Petroica">Petroica</a>"; the generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "petro-" "rock" and "oikos" "home", from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks. Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as "red robins" as distinct from the "yellow robins" of the genus "<a href="Eopsaltria">Eopsaltria</a>". It is not closely related to the <a href="American%20robin">American robin</a> or the <a href="European%20robin">European robin</a>; however, it is named after the European robin. Molecular research (and current consensus) places the Red-capped robin and its relatives—the Australian robin family <a href="Petroicidae">Petroicidae</a>—as a very early offshoot of the <a href="Passerida">Passerida</a>, or "advanced" songbirds, within the <a href="songbird">songbird</a> lineage.

No subspecies are recognised, and the only geographic variation recorded in plumage is a tendency for females from more arid regions to have paler plumage. Testing of the <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of Australian members of the genus "Petroica" suggests the red-capped robin's closest relative within the genus is the scarlet robin.

Officially known as the "red-capped robin", it has also been referred to as "redhead", "redcap", "robin red-breast" or "red-throated robin". "Kuburi" is a name used in the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a>. Across southwestern Australia, it was known as "menekedang" by the local indigenous people.

The smallest of the red robins, the red-capped robin is long with a wingspan of , and weighs around 7–9 g (0.25–0.31 <a href="ounce">oz</a>). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus "Petroica". The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second <a href="moult">moult</a>, which takes place at around or just over a year of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.
Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, <a href="canthaxanthin">canthaxanthin</a> and <a href="adonirubin">adonirubin</a>, are responsible for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at <a href="Terrick%20Terrick%20National%20Park">Terrick Terrick National Park</a> in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near <a href="Beverley%2C%20Western%20Australia">Beverley, Western Australia</a>, in 1990.

A variety of calls have been recorded, described as 'tinkle' and 'blurt' songs. These are similar across mainland Australia but distinct on <a href="Rottnest%20Island">Rottnest Island</a>; on the isolated island, birds rarely linked successive songs.

This species may be confused with the related <a href="flame%20robin">flame robin</a> ("P. phoenicea") and <a href="scarlet%20robin">scarlet robin</a> ("P. boodang"), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish tinge of the crown and whiter underparts.

The red-capped robin is found across Australia except for <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York</a>, the <a href="Top%20End">Top End</a> and most of the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> (there have been occasional sightings in the southernmost parts). Offshore populations exist on Rottnest Island, as well as <a href="Greenly%20Island%20%28South%20Australia%29">Greenly</a> and <a href="Pearson%20Island">Pearson Island</a>s off the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a>, but it is not found on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. Although widespread, it is uncommon in many areas; it is rare east of the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a>, in coastal regions in the south of the continent, and in the northern parts of its range—it is seldom encountered north of 20°S. Its movements are generally poorly known, particularly outside the breeding season. It is sedentary in much of the southern parts of its range, although the red-capped robin is a spring and summer visitor to the <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a> and <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> region in South Australia, and central <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. It is a winter visitor in the northern parts of its range.

The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat than its relatives, and inhabits dryer areas while the <a href="scarlet%20robin">scarlet robin</a> occupies wetter forests where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Callitris">Callitris</a>" or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga ("<a href="Acacia%20aneura">Acacia aneura</a>"), Georgina gidgee ("<a href="Acacia%20georginae">Acacia georginae</a>"), raspberry jam ("<a href="Acacia%20acuminata">Acacia acuminata</a>"), black cypress-pine ("<a href="Callitris%20endlicheri">Callitris endlicheri</a>"), white cypress-pine ("<a href="Callitris%20columellaris">C. columellaris</a>"), and slender cypress-pine ("<a href="Callitris%20preissii">C. preissii</a>") with <a href="understory">understory</a> shrubs such as "<a href="Cassia%20%28genus%29">Cassia</a>", hop-bush ("<a href="Dodonaea">Dodonaea</a>"), emu bush ("<a href="Eremophila%20%28plant%29">Eremophila</a>") and spinifex ("<a href="Triodia%20%28plant%20genus%29">Triodia</a>").

The species has generally fared badly with human change to the landscape. Once common on the <a href="Cumberland%20Plain">Cumberland Plain</a> in Sydney's western suburbs, it has now almost disappeared from the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>. It has also disappeared from the vicinity of <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton</a> in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.

The <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a> is known to prey on the red-capped robin, and several bird species including the <a href="Australian%20raven">Australian raven</a> ("Corvus coronoides"), <a href="grey%20shrike-thrush">grey shrike-thrush</a> ("Colluricincla harmonica"), <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey butcherbird</a> ("Cracticus torquatus") and <a href="white-browed%20babbler">white-browed babbler</a> ("Pomatostomus superciliosus") raid nests and take young. There is one record of a <a href="brown-headed%20honeyeater">brown-headed honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus brevirostris") <a href="egg%20predation">feeding on an egg</a>. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure.

The red-capped robin is generally encountered alone or in pairs, although groups of up to eight birds—a mated pair and their young—may be seen in autumn and winter. The species may join <a href="Mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species flocks</a> with other small insectivorous passerines; species recorded include the <a href="willie%20wagtail">willie wagtail</a> ("Rhipidura leucophrys"), <a href="southern%20whiteface">southern whiteface</a> ("Aphelocephala leucopsis"), <a href="rufous%20whistler">rufous whistler</a> ("Pachycephala rufiventris") and <a href="black-faced%20woodswallow">black-faced woodswallow</a> ("Artamus cinereus") in Queensland, and the <a href="chestnut-rumped%20thornbill">chestnut-rumped thornbill</a> ("Acanthiza uropygialis"), <a href="buff-rumped%20thornbill">buff-rumped thornbill</a> ("A. reguloides") or <a href="inland%20thornbill">inland thornbill</a> ("A. apicalis") in Western Australia.

The red-capped robin typically perches in a prominent location low to the ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.

The red-capped robin is <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> during the breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2 <a href="hectares">ha</a> (0.6–3 acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males have been seen to face one another apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been , from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to <a href="Gunbower%20State%20Forest">Gunbower State Forest</a> in northern Victoria.

The breeding season takes place over five months from August to January with up to three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. <a href="Spider%20web">Spider web</a>s, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with <a href="lichen">lichen</a> and camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring . Females alone develop <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a>es and <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubate</a>, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and there is some evidence that extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.

Like all passerines, the chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>; they are born blind and covered only by a thin layer of <a href="down%20feather">down</a>. By seven days, they are stretching wings and preening, and at two weeks they are able to fly. Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest, and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects such as flies and moths. Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood. In a field study near <a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a> in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single brood year, and in less than a week on both occasions in a pair which raised two broods in the season. The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. Despite this, on average only two young are successfully fledged per year.

The <a href="brush%20cuckoo">brush cuckoo</a> ("Cacomantis variolosus"), <a href="pallid%20cuckoo">pallid cuckoo</a> ("C. pallidus"), <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">Horsfield's bronze cuckoo</a> ("Chrysococcyx basalis"), and <a href="black-eared%20cuckoo">black-eared cuckoo</a> "(C. osculans)" have been recorded as <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>s of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.

The diet consists of insects and other small <a href="arthropods">arthropods</a>. One study of red-capped robin faeces conducted near <a href="Kambalda%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kambalda</a>, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet was made up of <a href="coleoptera">beetles</a>, while <a href="ant">ant</a>s made up the remainder. Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers including the <a href="Australian%20Plague%20Locust">Australian Plague Locust</a> ("Chortoicetes terminifera"), adult and larval butterflies and moths, including <a href="geometer%20moth">geometer moth</a>s, <a href="Odonata">dragonflies and damselflies</a>, <a href="mantis">mantis</a>es, <a href="antlion">antlion</a>s, <a href="Hemiptera">true bugs</a>, including chinch bugs of the family <a href="Lygaeidae">Lygaeidae</a> and <a href="Pentatomoidea">shield bugs</a>, various types of beetles, <a href="earwig">earwig</a>s, and flies such as <a href="Blow-fly">blow-flies</a> and <a href="Horse-fly">horse-flies</a>.

The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, although it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch may be used as a vantage point in hunting.

1880 Republican National Convention

The 1880 Republican National Convention convened from June 2 to June 8, 1880, at the Interstate Exposition Building in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, United States, and nominated <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> as the official candidates of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> and <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a>, respectively, in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880 presidential election</a>.

Of the 14 men in contention for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates leading up to the convention were <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, and <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was backed by the <a href="Stalwart%20%28politics%29">Stalwart</a> faction of the Republican Party, which supported <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>s and <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. Blaine was a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">senator</a> and former <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">representative</a> from <a href="Maine">Maine</a> who was backed by the <a href="Half-Breed%20%28politics%29">Half-Breed</a> faction of the Republican Party. Sherman, the brother of <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>, was serving as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> under President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>. A former senator from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, he was backed by delegates who did not support the Stalwarts or Half-Breeds.

On the first ballot, Sherman received 93 votes, while Grant and Blaine had 304 and 285, respectively. With 379 votes required to win the nomination, none of the candidates was close to victory, and the balloting continued. After the thirty-fifth ballot, Blaine and Sherman switched their support to a new "<a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a>" candidate, James Garfield. On the next ballot, Garfield won the nomination by receiving 399 votes, 93 higher than Grant's total. Garfield's Ohio delegation chose Chester A. Arthur, a Stalwart, as Garfield's vice-presidential running mate. Arthur won the nomination by capturing 468 votes, and the longest-ever Republican National Convention was subsequently adjourned. The Garfield–Arthur Republican ticket later defeated <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> and <a href="William%20Hayden%20English">William Hayden English</a> in the close 1880 presidential election.

As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes had caused heated tensions within the Republican Party. Hayes had moved away from party patronage by offering government jobs to <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a> instead of Northern Republicans. His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a> of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration that he would not run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions within the Republican Party, the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.

At the close of Grant's two terms as president in 1877, the Republican-controlled <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> suggested that Grant not return to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife <a href="Julia%20Grant">Julia</a>, "I do not want to be here [in the White House] another four years. I do not think I could stand it." After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to <a href="Post-presidency%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%23World%20tour">travel around the world</a>. A biographer from the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", <a href="John%20Russell%20Young">John Russell Young</a>, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called "Around the World with General Grant". Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> and <a href="Beijing">Peking, China</a>.

After Hayes' falling-out with the Republican Party and a perceived desire on the part of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>' electorate for a strong man in the White House, Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule, in hopes of seeking a third term in office. With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a "man of iron" to replace the "man of straw" in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a "triumvirate" with <a href="J.%20Donald%20Cameron">J. Donald Cameron</a> of Pennsylvania and <a href="John%20A.%20Logan">John A. Logan</a> of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, "Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant's nomination." An aide to the ex-president, <a href="Adam%20Badeau">Adam Badeau</a>, commented that Grant had become "extremely anxious to receive the nomination" and did not think that there was any chance of failure.

However, close friends of Grant saw that his public support was slipping. John Russell Young took Grant aside and told him that he would lose the election, and should withdraw to avoid embarrassment. Young argued that Grant was being heavily attacked by opponents, who were against the concept of a presidential <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">third term</a>. Young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told Grant that if he won the election, he would be indebted to the "triumvirate". Grant felt that his Stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid, and they deserved <a href="spoils%20system">political patronage</a> in his administration. Grant, nonetheless, listened to Young's advice and wrote a letter to J. Donald Cameron, authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other Stalwart backers. Upon hearing of his letter, Julia Grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest. She said, "If General Grant were not nominated, then let it be so, but he must not withdraw his name – no, never." Young delivered the letter to the "triumvirate" in Chicago on May 31, but no action was taken to remove Grant's name.

The other main contender for the Republican nomination was James G. Blaine. Blaine, a senator from Maine who had also served in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, including holding the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> position from 1869 to 1875, was in the competition to prevent Grant's nomination. Four years earlier Blaine had campaigned for the party's nomination; in the weeks prior to the <a href="1876%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1876 convention</a>, he was accused of committing <a href="fraud">fraud</a>ulent activities involving <a href="railroad">railroad</a> stocks. The specifics of Blaine's involvement were detailed in the Mulligan letters. Blaine pleaded his own defense on the floor of the House of Representatives, and he read aloud selected, edited portions of the letter that were not incriminating. Despite his attempt to clear his name, Blaine was tarnished by the scandal throughout the rest of his political career. On the Sunday before balloting was to begin in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, Blaine collapsed at the steps of Washington Congregational Church. He was unconscious for two days, and as a result, he lost supporters who were doubtful over his health and whether he was capable of handling the presidency. Blaine was also ridiculed by opponents, who accused him of faking illness to gain sympathy; the "<a href="New%20York%20Sun">New York Sun</a>" headlined "Blaine Feigns a Faint". On the first ballot of the 1876 convention, Blaine received 285 votes, while his political enemy, Roscoe Conkling, was in second place with only 99 votes. Blaine and Conkling had a long-standing political feud that started at a debate on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1866. After six more ballots resulted in no consensus, Conkling switched his support to Rutherford B. Hayes, who ultimately beat Blaine for the nomination.

After Blaine's failure in 1876, his supporters believed that he needed to be nominated at the 1880 convention in Chicago if he was ever going to be President, reasoning that if he tried for the nomination twice and failed, he could not count on another opportunity. As his campaign manager, <a href="William%20E.%20Chandler">William E. Chandler</a>, put it: 
Despite the Mulligan letters scandal, Blaine had succeeded remarkably in his 1880 campaign, attracting nationwide support for his candidacy. He argued for the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, support for big business, a <a href="tariff">tariff</a> to protect American jobholders, <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> for freed blacks and <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish independence</a>.

John Sherman was a longtime senator from Ohio who also served the state in the House of Representatives in the late 1850s and early 1860s. As a senator, Sherman led the planning of the national banking system. He also oversaw the national policy for the post-Civil War banking system, and helped restore the nation's finances after the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. Under President Hayes, Sherman served as the Secretary of the Treasury, advocating for the gold standard and building up the country's <a href="official%20gold%20reserves">gold reserves</a>. Sherman's colleagues did not have much confidence in their presidential bid. Sherman was known as the "Ohio Icicle" for his uncharismatic personality, which made him unappealing to voters. His colleagues commented that in public, Sherman "was not eloquent, though a graceful speaker, confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact." In private, he was "reserved, self-contained," a personality that many Americans were not comfortable with. As President, Sherman intended to continue his support for the gold standard. Prior to the start of the convention, papers had predicted Sherman to receive 110 votes in the balloting. Sherman felt that he still had a chance at the nomination once the Grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots.

James Garfield came into Chicago as a Senator-elect from Ohio, who had represented the state in the United States House since 1863. In 1859, as a Republican, Garfield was elected to the <a href="Ohio%20Senate">Ohio Senate</a>. The following year, he was admitted to the Ohio <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a>. He served as state senator until 1861, when he enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> at the start of the Civil War. Garfield was assigned to command the <a href="42nd%20Ohio%20Infantry">42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry</a>, and had the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Garfield later led an attack with a number of infantry regiments against a <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> cavalry at Jenny's Creek on January 6, 1862. The Confederates retreated, and for leading his men to victory, Garfield was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in March 1862.

Garfield later served under <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> and under <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Wood">Thomas J. Wood</a> at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Corinth">Siege of Corinth</a>. Garfield's health deteriorated and he was sent to serve on a commission to investigate the conduct of Union general <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a>. In the spring of 1863, Garfield returned to the field as chief of staff for <a href="William%20S.%20Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a>, commander of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a>. After the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Chickamauga campaign</a> in September 1863, Rosecrans was relieved of his command. Garfield saved his own reputation by fighting bravely during the battles, and he was subsequently promoted to the rank of major general. Garfield's fame spread, and <a href="William%20Dennison%20%28Ohio%20governor%29">William Dennison</a> engineered Garfield's 1863 election to Congress. As <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a> commented, Garfield was "the most able and prominent of the young politicians who entered the army at the outbreak of the war." Garfield did not want to leave the army, so he personally visited President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> for advice on the matter. Lincoln told Garfield that he had more generals than he could handle, and what he needed was political support.

Garfield succeeded in gaining re-election for his House seat every two years. In 1872, Garfield faced charges for receiving $329 in tainted money from the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier of America corruption scandal</a>. Garfield repeatedly denied the charges and even hired William E. Chandler to defend him in front of the congressional investigators. There was not much evidence against Garfield, so his political career was not significantly affected. Four years later, when James G. Blaine moved from the House to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, Garfield became the Republican <a href="Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">floor leader</a> of the House. That year, Garfield served as a member of the <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a> that awarded 20 hotly contested electoral votes to Rutherford B. Hayes in his <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">contest</a> for the Presidency against <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a>. Prior to the 1880 Republican National Convention, Garfield had expressed that he was a Blaine supporter. It was not until John Sherman entered the race that Garfield switched sides, and offered his support for the "Ohio Icicle".

In January, caucuses were held in local districts to pick delegates. The state conventions would then select a number of these delegates to represent the state at the national convention. Prior to the convention, there was a great deal of machine politics conducted by the candidates. John Sherman utilized Treasury Department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across the South to guarantee loyal state delegations. State-level bosses, like <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate. In the state delegate-selection convention at <a href="Utica%2C%20New%20York">Utica, New York</a>, Grant's supporters carried only a 217–180 majority over Blaine supporters, but Conkling passed a resolution declaring that, "the Republicans of New York believe the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant as Presidential candidate of urgent importance, and the delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination.

Conkling commanded delegates to follow the resolution, and if they were to violate it, he guaranteed they would be victims of political revenge and personal dishonor. However, in Chicago, there were a number of New York delegates who went against the resolution and publicly expressed their support for Blaine. J. Donald Cameron used similar tactics to intimidate dissenters in the Pennsylvania state convention. The third member of the "triumvirate", John A. Logan, literally locked out Blaine supporters from the Illinois state convention, and replaced them with personally chosen Grant supporters.

By May 29, four days before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and campaign followers had arrived at the <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Chicago%29">Union</a> and <a href="Dearborn%20Station%20%28Chicago%29">Dearborn</a> railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the "Albany Evening Journal", predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If that was not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.

Before any voting began, the delegates had to vote on the important matter of the unit rule. Prior to the start of the convention, James Garfield noted, "I regard it [the unit rule] as being more important than even the choice of a candidate." If the rule was supported by a majority of the delegates, then state party bosses, like the members of the "triumvirate", would be able to solidify Grant's nomination bid. If Conkling and the other Stalwart <a href="political%20boss">bosses</a> had their way, the nearly sixty dissenters from the states represented by the "triumvirate" would be silenced. Unfortunately for Half-Breeds, J. Donald Cameron was chairman of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>. Cameron planned to exercise his power to adopt new rules for the convention, and also suppress any dissenters of the unit rule. His plan was leaked, and within days, almost all the delegates in Chicago knew about it. Supporters of the Sherman and Blaine campaigns knew that they had to prevent Cameron from exercising his power. Blaine's forces agreed that they could only prevent Cameron from imposing the unit rule by removing him as the chair of the Republican National Committee.

At 7:00 P.M. on May 31, J. Donald Cameron convened the Republican National Committee's last meeting before the opening of the convention. Of the forty-six men at the meeting, Cameron counted only sixteen allies. The rest of the men were anti-Grant delegates who had decided to gang up on Cameron. <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> senator <a href="Jerome%20B.%20Chaffee">Jerome B. Chaffee</a> was the first to bring up the unit rule at the meeting. Chaffee handed Cameron a handwritten motion that was orchestrated by William E. Chandler. Cameron expected this, and knew he had to find some fault in Chaffee's motion. Cameron called Chaffee's motion out of order. Upon being questioned by Chaffee, Cameron explained that the committee could only appoint a temporary chairman to the convention, and could not vote on the unit rule issue (which he said belonged to the Rules Committee). Cameron then used <a href="George%20Cornelius%20Gorham">George Cornelius Gorham</a>, a <a href="California">California</a> Stalwart delegate who as secretary of the United States Senate had become an expert on parliamentary procedure, to justify his ruling. One by one, anti-Grant delegates unsuccessfully tried to appeal Cameron's motion. Gorham proclaimed that as committee chairman, Cameron could do "as he saw fit." <a href="Marshall%20Jewell">Marshall Jewell</a>, a <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> delegate and national committee member who had served in Grant's administration as <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a>, spoke up against Cameron's rulings. Cameron did not comment, and then called for a brief recess. After the recess, he acknowledged a motion from William E. Chandler to elect <a href="George%20Frisbie%20Hoar">George Frisbie Hoar</a>, a neutral senator and delegate from <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, as the convention's temporary chairman.

The committee voted 29–17 in favor of electing Hoar as temporary chairman of the convention. At midnight, the committee was adjourned, and the members agreed to continue the meeting the following morning. News of Cameron's behavior had spread throughout town overnight. His hardliner strategy had failed, and Conkling and other Grant managers sought to control the situation before it became any worse. The next morning, Conkling asked his trusted colleague, Chester A. Arthur, to solve the problem. Arthur assessed the situation and drew up a compromise. He met Chandler and the rest of the anti-Grant cabal at the entrance of the committee's suite. Arthur acknowledged that the Grant men had rejected Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman the day before, but said that the Grant men might perhaps reconsider. He proposed that the delegates decide on the unit rule in a free vote, and in return, Don Cameron would be restored as the chairman of the national committee. After discussing for a number of minutes, the two men came to an agreement. Arthur was confident that since Chandler, the leader of Blaine's campaign, had accepted the deal, then "it would be agreed by the Grant men." Chandler then discussed the compromise deal with the thirty anti-Grant committee members, and also James Garfield, who had previously expressed his opposition to the unit rule. 23 out of 30 anti-Grant men agreed to the terms, and Garfield commented that the proposition "must be accepted" in "spirit of reconciliation."

The committee reconvened again on the afternoon of June 1, with J. Donald Cameron sitting as the committee chairman. Arthur made a number of motions, indicating that the Grant men from New York and Pennsylvania would support Senator Hoar's appointment as the temporary chairman of the convention. No one objected and the motions were accepted. The meeting was then adjourned. A reporter from the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" later remarked that the Grant followers had been "saved from utter ruin by the excellent management of General Arthur..."

At noon on Wednesday, June 2, J. Donald Cameron banged his gavel to commence the beginning of the seventh Republican National Convention. As instructed, Cameron placed the nomination for Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman. The nomination was passed unanimously. Later, delegates John H. Roberts of Illinois and Christopher L. Magee of Pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries. Senator <a href="Eugene%20Hale">Eugene Hale</a> of Maine submitted a resolution for a roll call, in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the people from their delegation serving on the convention's three committees. The committees were formed, and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon.

The convention reconvened at 11:00 A.M. on June 3. Roscoe Conkling submitted a motion for a recess, but the motion was rejected. Another New York delegate, Henry R. Pierson from the Committee on Permanent Organization, submitted a proposal to make the temporary convention assignments permanent. The motion was adopted, and the convention took a four-hour recess until 5:00 P.M. After the recess, a motion was made for the Committee on Rules to be directed to report, but a substitute motion from George H. Sharpe of New York called for the Committee on Credentials to report. The substitute motion was rejected by a vote of 406 to 318, and the original resolution was laid on the table. At 7:30 P.M., the convention was adjourned until 10:00 A.M. the following morning.

The next morning, Conkling then submitted a resolution that bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about a dozen or so delegates answered "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, "[who] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, voted "no" to the resolution, and were showered with a "storm of hisses." Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [about a candidate]." He stated that "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C."

Afterwards, the fight over credentials erupted into a free-for-all. After John A. Logan had barred anti-Grant delegates from the state convention earlier in the year, they had decided to file credential reports. At the meeting between Arthur and Chandler, both men had agreed that the credentials issue could be discussed at the convention. A Chicago lawyer who supported Grant, Emery Storrs interrupted the legal argument over credentials by mocking the Blaine campaigners. His remarks set off a barrage of comments from both the Blaine and Grant sides. The convention went out of control, as people started shouting and jumping throughout the convention hall. As Garfield commented, the convention "seemed [as if] it could not be in America, but in the Sections of Paris in the ecstasy of the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a>." The fracas continued until 2:00 A.M. when acting chairman <a href="Green%20B.%20Raum">Green B. Raum</a>, the United States <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Internal%20Revenue">Commissioner of Internal Revenue</a>, banged the gavel to end the demonstration.

On Saturday night, the alphabetical roll call of the states to present nominees was conducted. The first candidate for the Republican nomination emerged when the Michigan delegation was in roll call. <a href="James%20Frederick%20Joy">James F. Joy</a>, the seventy-year-old president of the <a href="Michigan%20Central%20Railroad">Michigan Central Railroad</a>, gave the speech nominating Blaine. Joy was not a practiced public speaker, and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech, "because we are all now impatient for the voting." Joy ended his speech by nominating "James S. Blaine" for the Republican ticket. Promptly, a number of delegates yelled back, "G! G. Blaine, you fool!" The delegates from the next state in the roll call, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, nominated Senator <a href="William%20Windom">William Windom</a> as their "favorite son" candidate. Nine states later, Roscoe Conkling of New York stepped up to the podium to present his nomination for Ulysses S. Grant.
And when asked what State he hail from,
Our sole reply shall be,
He hails from Appomattox,
And its famous apple tree.
The crowd of 15,000 responded by erupting in cheers. Conkling built up the crowd's energy with his speech, and then introduced his candidate by proclaiming, "New York is for Ulysses S. Grant. Never defeated–never defeated in peace or in war, his name is the most illustrious borne by living men." He later spoke of Grant's loyalty to the American people, and then scolded Grant's enemies who had brought up the third term issue. Conkling tried to show that Grant was an honest person who had won the delegates "without patronage and without emissaries, without committees, [and ] without bureaus..." After Conkling finished his speech, boos and hisses came from Blaine and Sherman backers, while applause was heard from Stalwart supporters of Grant. After <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>'s roll call, the Ohio delegation brought out James Garfield to give the nomination speech for John Sherman.

Garfield had not actually written a speech, and was nervous about speaking in front of such a large crowd. Before heading to Chicago, Sherman told Garfield that Garfield's speech should stress Sherman's "courageous persistence in any course he had adopted." Garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride for his role in the convention. Garfield then listed the qualities that a president should possess and stressed the importance of party unity. It wasn't until near his conclusion that he mentioned Sherman by name. Many reports of Garfield's speech describe it as enthusiastic, eloquent, and well received. Some accounts indicate that it was so well-received that it caused delegates to begin thinking of Garfield as a contender for the presidential nomination.

On the other hand, some members of the Sherman campaign were disappointed by Garfield's speech. One telegram from a Sherman backer sent to Sherman himself claimed that, "[Garfield] has been of no service to you...he was extremely lukewarm in his support." Rumors began to spread that Ohio Governor <a href="Charles%20Foster%20%28Ohio%20politician%29">Charles Foster</a> and Garfield, who were in adjoining suites at the <a href="Grand%20Pacific%20Hotel%20%28Chicago%29">Grand Pacific Hotel</a>, were "conspiring to bring Garfield out as [a] candidate..." News of the finger-pointing within the Sherman camp had carried into newspapers across the country. The "Albany Evening Journal" reported that "[t]here is a general belief that the Ohio delegation is ready to desert Sherman and go over to Blaine in a body."

Although he had become popular with the delegates after his speech, Garfield was upset over the accusations of those inside the Sherman group, and he worried how they would affect him in the future. His close colleagues felt he was becoming too popular, too quickly. Friends, like Lorenzo Coffin, felt that his "time is not yet." Garfield heeded the advice of his friends to lower his profile at the convention, but he had already made a deep impression on the delegates. Late Sunday night on June 6, Indiana senator <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, grandson of former President <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, came to Garfield's hotel suite and asked him under what conditions he would accept the nomination. Garfield replied that he had come to the convention for the sole purpose of supporting John Sherman, and told Harrison that Garfield's "name must not be used [in the nomination]."

At ten o'clock on Monday morning, convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel to open the convention. Eugene Hale moved to immediately proceed to the presidential nominee balloting, and Roscoe Conkling seconded the motion. Newspapers had predicted the results of the balloting, and the delegates knew that it would take a number of ballots before a victor could be found. The first surprise during the balloting roll call came when John A. Logan of Illinois announced that of his state's forty-two delegates, only twenty-four were in support of Grant. This was not as "solid" as Logan had previously advertised to the rest of the Grant backers. New York faced a similar situation. Of its seventy delegates, fifty-one supported Grant, seventeen were for Blaine, and the remaining two supported Sherman. Pennsylvania fared even worse, as only thirty-two of the state's fifty-eight delegates put in their support for Grant.

After all the states were polled, the results were tabulated. Grant received 304 votes, Blaine had 284, Sherman had 93, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> senator <a href="George%20F.%20Edmunds">George F. Edmunds</a> received 34, <a href="Elihu%20B.%20Washburne">Elihu B. Washburne</a>, who had served as the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20France">United States Ambassador to France</a> under President Grant, had 30, and Minnesota senator William Windom received 10. Of the states represented by the "triumvirate", sixty delegates did not support Grant. None of the candidates were close to the 379 needed to secure the nomination, so the balloting continued throughout the day.

In <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, both Blaine and Sherman were disappointed by their first-ballot vote totals. Blaine had been told that he should expect around 300 first-ballot votes, but his actual total fell sixteen short, and it was also one vote fewer than the total he received on the first ballot at the 1876 Convention. Sherman was told to expect 110 votes, which was significantly lower than the expected totals for Blaine and Grant. However, Sherman felt his chance would come later, when the Grant vote split apart. After Sherman heard his first-ballot vote totals, he grew visibly angry that "some of them [the votes] were taken away from him before the ballot began." He was upset that nine Ohio delegates bolted from Sherman and voted instead for his opponent, James G. Blaine. Sherman blamed Blaine for causing the delegates to bolt from Ohio "by [methods of] falsehood, ridicule and treachery." In <a href="Galena%2C%20Illinois">Galena</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, Grant did not express any emotions after being told about the first-ballot vote totals. As one newsman reported, "[t]he silent soldier was smoking his cigar with all his usual serenity." Grant's wife, Julia, expected a deadlock, and suggested to her husband that he surprise the delegates in Chicago with a visit. Grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners. Despite his wife's attempts to change his mind, Grant remained adamant.

Meanwhile, the delegates at the convention continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote for most of the day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, and the rest of the votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.

Suggestions for introducing a "dark horse" candidate began to take place. Members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination, but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting. Backers for Sherman and Blaine met after the convention was adjourned. Chandler laid down his terms. Blaine had nearly 300 votes, and could not simply withdraw. As Chandler explained, even "[i]f Mr. Blaine permits his column to be broken, [then] <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> & twelve votes in the Territories will go to Grant...[as would] Mr. Blaine's Southern votes." Both sides argued until two or three in the morning, but no decision had been reached. Grant leaders had also met that night in Roscoe Conkling's suite in the Grand Pacific Hotel. They discussed the imposing dangers of Grant's nomination bid, such as the third-term resistors. Many speculated that Grant was not going to receive the nomination. The Grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates, and found them both to be unacceptable. Some of the men called for Conkling himself as a substitute for Grant. They argued that with Grant out of the race, Conkling would face little resistance for the Republican nomination. However, Conkling refused to accept the idea of being nominated for president. He said "[even] if I were to receive every other vote in the Convention, my own would still be lacking, and that I would not give. I am here as the agent of New York to support General Grant to the end. Any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected, and could not be elected.

The first ballot on Tuesday morning, June 8, saw two major breaks in the voting. Massachusetts switched their twenty-one votes from Senator George Edmunds to John Sherman, spiking his total to 116, the highest thus far. William Chandler also convinced three Minnesota delegates to switch their support from their "favorite son" candidate, William Windom, to James G. Blaine. By the thirty-second ballot, Blaine had dropped six votes from the night before, and Grant had increased his total to 309. Despite the relatively small changes in votes totals Roscoe Conkling confidently claimed that the "[m]embers of the N.Y. Delegation assert that Grant will be nominated before one o'clock." On the thirty-third ballot, nine Wisconsin delegates shifted their support from Grant to Elihu Washburne. On the next ballot, sixteen of twenty Wisconsin delegates changed their vote to James Garfield. Garfield immediately called to chairman Hoar to raise a question of order. Garfield "challenge[d] the correctness of the announcement", claiming that without his consent, he should not be receiving votes. Hoar dismissed Garfield's question, claiming later that he denied Garfield because he did not want to see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order, meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy. At this point the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant, 275 for Blaine, 107 for Sherman, and 17 for Garfield. Then, during the thirty-fifth ballot roll call, Indiana shifted all 27 of its votes (mostly the Blaine column) to Garfield. Four Maryland delegates and one delegate each from <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> and North Carolina also switched their votes to Garfield, bringing his total to 50.

Blaine, seeing that his chances for winning the nomination were slipping, came to the conclusion that James Garfield was the most suitable alternative nominee to himself. Garfield was a close friend, and Blaine felt that by supporting Garfield, he could defeat Grant and Conkling and possibly receive an appointment in Garfield's administration. Similarly, Sherman, acting upon advice from his colleagues, decided to shift all his support to Garfield, to "save the Republican Party." Both candidates told their supporters to support Garfield's nomination.
With the Blaine and Sherman forces now rallying to Garfield, the move toward the Ohio congressman became a stampede on the next ballot, the convention's thirty-sixth. Garfield won 399 votes, 93 more than Grant, putting him over the top and giving him the Republican nomination. Blaine finished with 42, Washburne had 5, John Sherman had 3, and the remaining were split amongst other minor candidates. Garfield was so overwhelmed with emotion after winning the nomination that an "Inter Ocean" reporter noted that he looked "pale as death, and seemed to be half-unconsciously to receive the congratulations of his friends." The convention was in a mad frenzy as thousands of people chanted for Garfield, and later joined in the singing of the "<a href="Battle%20Cry%20of%20Freedom">Battle Cry of Freedom</a>". The Grant followers, like Roscoe Conkling, looked on with "glum faces" and made "no effort to conceal their disappointment." Conkling took great pride in the 306 delegates who had supported Grant throughout the entire balloting. With the Grant supporters, Conkling formed a "Three Hundred and Six Guard" society. The society held annual dinners, and even drew up a commemorative coin with the inscription, "The Old Guard".

Afterwards, chairman Hoar banged his gavel and announced, "James A. Garfield, of Ohio, is nominated for President of the United States." Garfield wrote a letter to his wife stating that "if the results meet your approval, I shall be content [with the nomination]." Garfield's wife, <a href="Lucretia%20Garfield">Lucretia</a>, was thrilled with her husband's nomination and gave her approval. (Garfield subsequently resigned the Senate seat to which he had been elected for the term beginning in 1881, and the Ohio Legislature then elected Sherman.)

Garfield and the Ohio delegation desired a New York Stalwart as Garfield's vice presidential running mate, partly to placate Conkling, and partly to balance the ticket geographically. <a href="Levi%20P.%20Morton">Levi P. Morton</a> declined after consulting with Conkling, who was still unhappy over Grant's loss and advised Morton not to accept. The nomination was then offered (surreptitiously, and without consulting Garfield) to <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, who had close <a href="Stalwart%20%28politics%29">Stalwart</a> ties to Conkling, but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker the compromise on the selection of a convention chairman. Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting, urging him to "drop it as you would a red hot shoe from the forge," but Arthur insisted that he would, calling the Vice Presidency "a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining." Arthur won the nomination after he received 468 votes, next to the 193 for Elihu Washburne, and 44 for the third major candidate, Marshall Jewell. Former <a href="governor%20of%20Texas">Governor</a> <a href="Edmund%20J.%20Davis">Edmund J. Davis</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and several others were also nominated, but received little support. After convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel at 7:25 P.M. on June 8, the longest ever Republican National Convention was adjourned.

Garfield led the first <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> for the Presidency. He did not travel that much, and he usually stayed at home to present his presidential agenda to visitors. Garfield enlisted the support of the other candidates from the convention to help with the campaign. The 1880 Democratic National Convention chose Winfield Scott Hancock as the presidential candidate and William Hayden English as his vice-presidential running mate. The election featured a very close popular vote that put Garfield ahead with a majority of less than 10,000; some sources put the margin as low as 2,000. However, Garfield won the election with 214 of the 369 electoral votes in the country.

On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by a former Chicago lawyer named <a href="Charles%20J.%20Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a> at the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad</a> Station in Washington, D.C. Guiteau was a staunch supporter of the Stalwarts, and he even gave speeches in New York to rally Grant supporters. After Garfield was elected president, Guiteau repeatedly tried to contact the president and his Secretary of State James G. Blaine in hopes of receiving the <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consulship</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. After finally being told by Blaine that he would not get the position, Guiteau decided to seek revenge on Garfield. He planned Garfield's assassination for weeks. After shooting Garfield, he proclaimed "I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President." Garfield died on September 19, more than two and a half months after the shooting. After a lengthy trial, Guiteau was sentenced to death, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882.

Global Environment and Trade Study

The Global Environment & Trade Study (GETS) was a non-profit research institute established in 1994 to study the complex linkages between international trade and environmental sustainability. GETS supported numerous research projects on the legal, economic, and ecological aspects of trade and environment.

GETS was centered at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>.

GETS also studied the expanding role of civil society in <a href="global%20governance">global governance</a>.

In 2004, the GETS Board decided that a sufficient amount had been accomplished over the decade, and that it was time to terminate the project.

GETS had four major accomplishments: 

The founders of GETS were: James Cameron, <a href="Steve%20Charnovitz">Steve Charnovitz</a>, <a href="Daniel%20C.%20Esty">Daniel Esty</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Ritchie">Mark Ritchie</a>. 

In 2000, Monica Araya <a href="http%3A//www.monica-araya.com"></a> joined the GETS Board and focused on environment, trade and investment issues in developing countries.

Some staff associated with GETS included Orin Kirshner, who served as Executive Director from 2001–2003, Beatrice Chaytor, Hari Osofsky, and John Wickham.

GETS had three major participating institutions—the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development (located in London), the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (located in Minneapolis), 
and the <a href="Yale%20Center%20for%20Environmental%20Law%20and%20Policy">Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy</a> (located in New Haven)

In addition, GETS collaborated with numerous research institutes in developed and developing countries.

GETS held policy conferences or workshops in Cancun, Geneva, London, Miami, New York, Seattle, Tokyo, and Washington.

GETS also held a major Conference in Singapore in June 1996 co-sponsored with the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Singapore">National University of Singapore</a>. At the end of that Conference, the co-chairs (<a href="Tommy%20Koh">Tommy Koh</a>, Dan Esty, and James Cameron) issued a statement with several recommendations, many of which were adopted by the WTO, other international organizations, and governments in subsequent years.

The major funders of GETS included: the Ford Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, the German-Marshall Fund, the John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Center for Global Partnership/Japan Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

A retrospective on competitiveness and the Council's work was recently written by Martin Neil Baily and Robert Z. Lawrence.

Principals and researchers supported by GETS produced dozens of books and articles on trade and the environment, and related topics during its ten years of operation. Among them were:

Allen Walker

Hoshino based Allen's <a href="characterization">characterization</a> on Robin, the shorter-haired female protagonist of the <a href="one-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> comic "Zone". She designed Allen's clothing to resemble that of the nineteenth century, giving him a ribbon tie and other accessories to make him appear gentlemanly. Hoshino gave Allen a calm demeanor in contrast with her typical rambunctious, rude characters; and to make him look intimidating she gave Allen a <a href="pentagram">pentagram</a>-shaped scar. The manga was adapted for television as an <a href="anime">anime</a> series in which Allen was voiced by <a href="Sanae%20Kobayashi">Sanae Kobayashi</a>. The voices were recast for the 2016 anime television series "<a href="D.Gray-man%20Hallow">D.Gray-man Hallow</a>", in which <a href="Ayumu%20Murase">Ayumu Murase</a> replaced Kobayashi. In the English adaptation of the anime series, Allen was voiced by <a href="Todd%20Haberkorn">Todd Haberkorn</a>.

Allen is popular with "D.Gray-man" readers; he is usually ranking in the top three in the series' popularity polls and reaction to the character in manga and anime publications and other media has been generally positive. His characterization has been praised; critics said his calm demeanor and mysterious origin are atypical of a "<a href="Sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen</a>" protagonist. Some reviewers enjoyed Allen's multiple voice actors. Merchandise featuring Allen's likeness, including plush dolls, figurines, clothing and <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> pieces, has been offered. In addition to the character's appearances in the anime series "D.Gray-man" and its sequel "D.Gray-man Hallow", he has appeared in three <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a>s, two <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s and several <a href="crossovers%20in%20video%20games">crossover</a> <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a>s.

Manga creator <a href="Katsura%20Hoshino">Katsura Hoshino</a> originally had no plans to create Allen's character in "D.Gray-man"; she wanted the Millennium Earl to be the story's protagonist. Hoshino found the Earl unsuitable for use as a main character in a manga magazine aimed at teenagers so she created Allen. Hoshino thought a mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best clothed with a Black Order uniform, she wondered whether it should be more masculine. Hoshino said she did not know how Allen originated; she likes her main characters to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said the general idea for his design was an "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order—the group Allen joins—she sensed a "lack of coordination". To make a bigger impact with Allen's arrival to the Black Order, Hoshino gave him the nickname "Destroyer of Time", which has no relevance to the story.

Hoshino based Allen on Robin, the protagonist of her <a href="One-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> comic "Zone". Comparing the two, she called Allen a "different kind of boy". According to Hoshino's first editor, Allen was originally going to be a modified Akuma who looked like a boy. Her editor advised her to make Allen more vulnerable by depicting him crying, which led to Allen's gender being male to make a bigger impact with the readers. As the manga continued, Hoshino called him a comrade and found a relationship between herself and the character, although Hoshino still admired the Millennium Earl.

While creating the character, Hoshino was afraid readers might dislike Allen because she wrote him as a hypocrite; even though Allen is a human, he has sympathy for his enemies, the souls trapped inside the Akumas and the Noah clan. Hoshino did not like Allen because of his negative actions despite his caring words. She also wondered whether readers would care for a protagonist who is friendly with both his friends and his enemies. Despite her worries, Hoshino's editor said it would be positive if Allen remained as a hypocrite until the ending. Despite difficulties in writing him, Hoshino liked the challenge of writing Allen, expecting that future manga protagonists also provide authors with this problem.

Allen was introduced as a "gentleman" but his characterization changed to the point that Hoshino wrote an interview between the character and herself. In the interview she complained to Allen about his change from "pure and innocent" to a "corrupted" character, calling him "Dark Allen". "Allen" replied that the change must be due to the series' dark setting. She demonstrated Allen's dark side when the character struck his master <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Cross%20Marian">Cross Marian</a> in anger at his inability to learn how he would become the 14th <a href="Noah">Noah</a> descendant: <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Nea%20Nea%20D.%20Campbell">Nea D. Campbell</a>. According to Hoshino, Cross Marian was angry with Allen for the attack but enjoyed seeing this side of his student. While Allen became a darker character, Hoshino also wanted to symbolize his own fear in the way his persona became afraid his late guardian Mana Walker did not love him. As a result, Hoshino made a minor design change and rearranged the scar Mana's Akuma placed on his forehead in a berserker state; by having the scar show more clearly, Allen's disturbance about his love for Mana was more clearly expressed. For the arc involving the Third Exorcists, Hoshino's editors advised her to draw Allen as a fighter for the sake of the manga's characters Yu Kanda and Alma Karma, who are heavily featured in the saga.

Hoshino drew Allen with hair longer than Robin's and found it difficult to decide on a hairstyle. She parted his hair in the center to emphasize his facial expressions. Because he is an exorcist, she wanted him to have a "very scary-looking image" and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a "gloomy" impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late 19th century; his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a "gentlemanly image".

According to Hoshino, later in the series Allen's hairstyle becomes similar to that of a <a href="Super%20Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a>—a transformation in the "<a href="Dragon%20Ball">Dragon Ball</a>" series in which the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in "D.Gray-man"s publication, Allen was one of the most difficult characters to draw. By the tenth volume, she said the character was more difficult to draw than <a href="Yu%20Kanda">Yu Kanda</a>. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors—red and light blue—due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title "D.Gray-man" is intended to have several meanings, most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters.

During a story arc in which Allen tries to save a former Exorcist named Suman Dark, Allen's own Innocence—his deformed arm "Cross"— is destroyed in a confrontation. Because Allen trains in a sub-branch of the Black Order to regain his Innocence, Hoshino wanted to show Allen's real powers. Hoshino said she experienced a lack of inspiration in what it would be its true form to the point of feeling Allen's frustration at not being able to fight again. Eventually, Hoshino was inspired to draw Allen's real Innocence—the Crowned Clown—which is based on the Italian <a href="Pierrot">Pierrot</a>. She was satisfied with Allen's dialogue that he would fight for both humans and Akumas, symbolized by his two hands, and drew this scene carefully. By the series' beginning, Hoshino intended Allen's weaponry to evolve because she started feeling that Allen's first weapon, Cross, might be appealing to the readers. Crown Clown was created to be a more stylish and cooler weapon for Allen. Because Allen hides his identity from the Order but still claims to be an exorcist in a later arc, Hoshino conceived a new design for him that represents his self-proclamation of being one.

Allen leaves the Black Order because the previous story arc had too many characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's valediction to comrade <a href="Lenalee%20Lee">Lenalee Lee</a> because it connotes the character's maturation. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series he and Lenalee are depicted at the same height. Hoshino said although Allen's departure fits the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda, despite their frequent arguments, part on good terms; Hoshino said Kanda would assist Allen in the next story. Allen's withdrawal from the Order had been planned since he encountered the enemy <a href="Road%20Kamelot%23Road%20Kamelot">Road Kamelot</a> because Allen's nature conflicts with those of the other Exorcists, who unlike him do not wish to save the Akumas.

When Allen left the Order, Hoshino said the character had become difficult to write. Allen is a philanthropist; Hoshino said she was not equally kind. Because "<a href="Jump%20Square">Jump Square</a>"—the manga's host magazine at the time— was aimed at a young male audience, Hoshino said she wanted to characterize Allen as a cheerful person rather than a troubled teenager. She found this depiction difficult because his life became more complicated as the series progressed. Hoshino tries to balance Allen between "strength and sorrow", and has required occasional hiatuses. She said the most challenging part of Allen's face to draw is his smile; he often smiles, sometimes when he is lying or unhappy. After Allen left the Order, Hoshino told readers his life might be arduous and that he would cheat at gambling, which learns while training with Cross Marian. As the plot progressed, Hoshino still found difficulties in writing him because he is suffering while remaining cheerful. Chapter 222 proved more challenging for Hoshino because Allen's life was becoming difficult. During these moments, Allen's mind starts being erased from his body because he is being possessed by the Noah Nea D. Campbell. In an inner world, Allen feels he wishes to be erased and freed of pain while interacting with an illusion of Cross Marian. He remembers his beliefs and smiles at Cross' illusion despite crying at the same time.

In the first animated version of "D.Gray-man" Allen is voiced by <a href="Sanae%20Kobayashi">Sanae Kobayashi</a>, whom Hoshino praised for capturing the character. During recording of the anime, Kobayashi befriended the Earl's voice actor <a href="Junpei%20Takiguchi">Junpei Takiguchi</a> as they chatted whenever their characters were absent from a recording, much to Hoshino's surprise. For its anime sequel, "D.Gray-man Hallow", Kobayashi was replaced with <a href="Ayumu%20Murase">Ayumu Murase</a>. Murase said he had positive thoughts about his work, hoping it would appeal to the audience. During recordings of "Hallow", Hoshino was surprised by Murase's work, finding him suitable for Allen. Murase's switching between two personalities—Allen and the Nea D. Campbell—impressed the manga author, who thought at first Murase was using a machine to change the tone of them. Although Murase only appeared with the Millennium Earl twice in "Hallow", his job left a positive impression. During a broadcast of "Hallow", Hoshino made multiple illustrations of Allen interacting with the Noah clan to support the actors. Murase was moved by Hoshino's determination to develop Allen in the manga and thus felt a better impression of his character. Allen is voiced by <a href="Todd%20Haberkorn">Todd Haberkorn</a> for the two series' English-language dubs; according to Haberkorn, he enjoyed voicing the character, and once <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a>ed as him. In 2016, Haberkorn said that if he could voice Allen again he would pierce his ears.

Allen was born with a deformed left arm caused by the effects of a rare object known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus, where he meets <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Mana%20Walker">Mana Walker</a>, a clown who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires. When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through a man known as the <a href="Millennium%20Earl">Millennium Earl</a>. Mana is revived as an Akuma demon and cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens, becomes an anti-Akuma weapon later called and destroys Mana. His left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Cross%20Marian">Cross Marian</a> soon adopts Allen as a disciple.

When Allen completes his exorcist training he is sent to Black Order headquarters. With his new colleagues, he goes on missions to recover other lost Innocences. He fights the Millennium Earl, his army of Akuma and the <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23The%20Noah%20Family">Noah Family</a>—a group of immortal humans who help the Earl and want to destroy the world. Allen and four other exorcists are sent to locate and protect Cross. When Allen leaves the group to save a traitor from the Black Order, a Noah (<a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Tyki%20Mikk">Tyki Mikk</a>) nearly kills him. Allen stays at the Black Order's Asia Branch headquarters to recover from the experience.

During his stay at the headquarters, Allen's Innocence takes its true form; the , a cape-like armor. He rejoins his comrades in <a href="Edo">Edo</a>, where the group is trapped in <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. Allen and his friends fight the Noah while trying to escape. In his rematch with Tyki, Allen transforms his left arm into a sword that exorcises evil.

Returning to headquarters, Allen's loyalty is questioned and he is given an inspector, <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Howard%20Link">Howard Link</a>. The Noah then send Akumas to eliminate the Order; Allen and the Generals eliminate them but are defeated by the evolved Level 4 Akuma. Allen rejoins the fight with the help of his master and Lenalee Lee; they eliminate the Akuma. Shortly afterwards, Allen learns he is the host of the late 14th Noah (<a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Nea%20D.%20Campbell">Nea D. Campbell</a>). Before his death, Nea implanted his memories in Allen so he would be reborn. All Exorcists are ordered to kill Allen before he transforms into a Noah. Allen controls his body but he begins turning into Nea; Crowned Clown's sword hurts him, despite it only affecting Noah and Akuma.

During a fight against the Noah, Allen is imprisoned by the Order, who fear the reappearance of Nea. There, he is attacked by <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Apocryphos">Apocryphos</a>, a sentient Innocence that tries to assimilate Allen's Innocence. Two Noahs and Link rescue Allen, making the Order believe he has betrayed them. Allen refuses help from the Order and the Noah, but promises Lenalee he will remain an exorcist. Allen goes into hiding and disguises himself as a clown. He is sought by his former comrades and the Noah. Allen's mind begins to leave his body due to Nea's awakening; a Cross illusion tells him to meet <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Katerina%20Eve%20Campbell">Katerina Eve Campbell</a> to learn the truth behind Nea and Mana.

In addition to appearing in the manga and anime series, Allen is a <a href="Player%20character">playable character</a> in two "D.Gray-man" video games. He is a playable or support character in the <a href="Fictional%20crossovers%20in%20video%20games">crossover</a> fighting games "<a href="Jump%20Super%20Stars">Jump Super Stars</a>", "<a href="Jump%20Ultimate%20Stars">Jump Ultimate Stars</a>" and "<a href="J-Stars%20Victory%20Vs">J-Stars Victory Vs</a>", which pit "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>" characters against each other.

Allen also appears in Kaya Kizaki's "D.Gray-man" <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a> series. In the first novel, he searches for Black Order headquarters and then disappears. He kills Akuma and learns the Order's location from a woman named Mother. In the second novel, he is a supporting character who attends the Black Order's reunion party. Allen appears briefly in the first chapter of the third novel; he greets the Black Order scientist Rohfa, who is infatuated with him. The second chapter follows his life in the circus, where he was known as —and befriends Mana the clown and his dog Allen. After an Akuma destroys the circus, Red adopts the name "Allen" and travels with Mana.

Allen is about 15 years old when the series begins. Although most of his colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Nea">Nea</a>, who later possesses his body, suspects he may be <a href="Age%20regression%20in%20therapy">growing younger</a>. Allen is often accompanied by <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Timcampy">Timcampy</a>, a small flying <a href="golem">golem</a> given to him by his mentor Exorcist General <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Cross%20Marian">Cross Marian</a>. As a result of the trauma of attempting to revive his guardian <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Mana%20Walker">Mana Walker</a>, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of Allen's left eye allows him to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. He fights both to save the Akuma's souls and for his human friends, and devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen is originally cynical and rude but he adopts Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to the speech style he used before he met Mana.

Allen Walker is popular with "D.Gray-man" readers; he was the most-popular character in the series' first "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Shōnen Jump</a>" poll. He dropped to second place behind Yu Kanda in a second poll. The character returned to first place in the third poll and fell behind Kanda again in the fourth. Allen has also been popular outside "D.Gray-man", and was the 20th-most-popular anime character in an "Animedia" poll. He ranked 20th in a 2007 "<a href="Newtype">Newtype</a>" character poll. In "Newtype", Allen was nominated as the fifth-best male character of the <a href="2016%20in%20anime">2016 anime season</a> for his role in "D.Gray-man Hallow". The character was voted the 17th-best male character in an Anime News Network poll, and was 46th in a 2016 "<a href="Animage">Animage</a>" poll of top 100 anime characters for his role in "Hallow". Anime News Network listed him as the third-best anime exorcist based on his tragic backstory and weaponry used to exorcise Akumas.

Merchandise featuring the character, including key chains, plush dolls figurines, clothing and <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> pieces have been marketed; he has also been popular with cosplayers. New merchandise, in which Allen is often disguised as a vampire, was developed for <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> 2016, and a <a href="pi%C3%B1a%20colada">piña colada</a> drink was based on the character.

Manga, anime, video-game and related media publications have praised and criticized the character. Sheena McNeil of the <a href="online%20magazine">online magazine</a> "Sequential Tart" liked Allen's design and called his anti-Akuma weapon "quite impressive". According to McNeil, the combination of his cursed left eye and his white hair make him "much more striking". <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a>'s Casey Brienza also praised his design, saying he looks like a "<a href="visual%20kei">visual kei</a> rock star" and calling him "a nice change of pace" from other "shōnen" protagonists. His redesign for "Hallow" received similar reactions from Amrita Aulakh of "Pop Wrapped", who stated he was one of the best "Shonen Jump" protagonists alongside <a href="Gintoki%20Sakata">Gintoki Sakata</a> from "<a href="Gin%20Tama">Gin Tama</a>". 
Kevin Leathers of the <a href="UK%20Anime%20Network">UK Anime Network</a> noted that Allen differs from the genre's typical main characters. Leathers saw little character development, writing; "[he] is focused on his job, but will always make time for his friends, which while different, isn't interesting over a long period of time". Tom Tonhat of "<a href="Escapist%20%28magazine%29">Escapist</a>" magazine called Allen a "good lead character". Active Anime's Sandra Scholes found him mysterious, citing his arrival at the Black Order and the anti-Akuma weapon. Critics have noted Allen's interactions with other characters during the series. IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief provided by his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of "Fandom Post" considered the team of Allen Walker and Yu Kanda is the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose said he enjoyed the plot in which Allen is unable to distinguish Innocents from Akumas.

Allen's abilities were described as "rather inspired" by Michael Aronson of "<a href="Manga%20Life">Manga Life</a>" magazine. Brian Henson of Mania Beyond Entertainment wrote that Allen's mysterious, cursed eye might appeal to readers of the series. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that Allen did not use "cleverness" to defeat Akuma but let his arm "overpower the enemy". Allen was described as a "solid" hero by A.E. Sparrow of <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. Todd Douglass Jr. of <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> wrote that the character's use of the anti-Akuma weapon might seem clichéd; he found its anime depiction entertaining. In following fights, Allen's rematch with Noah <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Tyki%20Mikk">Tyki Mikk</a> was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime News Network, who also liked his new abilities, the Innocence Crown Clown and Allen's sword—which he compared with a sword in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" wielded by protagonist <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud Strife</a>. Reviewing the same fight, "<a href="Otaku%20USA">Otaku USA</a>"s Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki.

Manga Retcon said Allen's activities in the manga are one of the deepest parts of the 13th volume because of his interactions with his friends despite the scene's apparent simplicity. According to Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network, the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki during Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma is interesting; it leads to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger. Allen's valediction with Lenalee in "Hallow" has been described as one of the season's best scenes because of the way it was directed, noting Allen's growth and the apparent romantic tone between both characters.

Reviewers were also impressed with Allen's betrayal of the Order and his transformation into the <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Nea">14th Noah</a>; Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock found the discussion as intense as a battle. Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network noted the revelation has a powerful impact on Allen because of his future and because he starts doubting his guardian Mana ever loved him while it leaves Allen's mental state while dealing with it mysterious. Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post enjoyed the appearance of the 14th Noah in Allen's mind, praising the character's internal conflict.

Leroy Douresseaux of <a href="Comic%20Book%20Bin">Comic Book Bin</a> liked Allen's situation in volume 21 and wanted to see more of the same, rather than the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of <a href="List%20of%20D.Gray-man%20characters%23Alma%20Karma">Alma Karma</a>. In the next volume, Chris Kirby, also of The Fandom Post, was impressed by Allen's possession by Nea. Alex Osborn of IGN was shocked by Allen's first possession by the 14th Noah, seeing in previous episodes a "beam of light in an otherwise dark series" and finding the possession "disturbing". According to Osborn, Allen was becoming "an increasingly more complex and interesting character". Anne Lauenroth wrote that the struggle between Allen and the 14th Noah left the character in need of a friend; Cross Marian's words and care give Allen a "path". In the book "Representing Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels", Jacob Birken wrote that Allen's use of his powers illustrates the series' theme of identity; although Allen seems to become more human through his Innocence, the revelation that he is the 14th Noah mutes that humanity.

Allen's voice actors have also been reviewed. "<a href="Animation%20Insider">Animation Insider</a>"s Kimberly Morales wrote that <a href="Todd%20Haberkorn">Todd Haberkorn</a>, who voiced Allen for the English version of the anime, does a "decent job" matching the original work by Japanese actor <a href="Sanae%20Kobayashi">Sanae Kobayashi</a>. Michael Marr of Capsule Computers also enjoyed Haberkorn's work and agreed with Morales that it is as appealing as Kobayashi's. Because the series begins in Europe, Casey Brienza criticized Haberkorn for not giving Allen a British accent. "<a href="Neo%20%28magazine%29">Neo</a>" found Kobayashi's work more engaging than Haberkorn's. Lauenroth enjoyed the voice work of <a href="Ayumu%20Murase">Ayumu Murase</a>, who replaced Kobayashi for the second "D.Gray-man" anime "D.Gray-man Hallow". In a later review, Lauenroth praised Murase's work for voicing two characters; Allen and the 14th Noah. Thanasis Karavasilis of Manga Tokyo stated that while many fans of the series were bothered by Murase replacing Kobayashi, he did not mind the change in Allen's voice. Aulakh expressed similar thoughts based on Murase's career, believing the actor would fit the character.

Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman

Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman is the 18th-century British feminist <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>'s unfinished <a href="novelist">novelist</a>ic sequel to her revolutionary political treatise "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792). "The Wrongs of Woman" was published posthumously in <a href="1798%20in%20literature">1798</a> by her husband, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, and is often considered her most radical <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> work.

Wollstonecraft's <a href="philosophical%20novel">philosophical</a> and <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> novel revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband. It focuses on the societal rather than the individual "wrongs of woman" and criticizes what Wollstonecraft viewed as the <a href="patriarchy">patriarchal</a> institution of marriage in eighteenth-century Britain and the legal system that protected it. However, the heroine's inability to relinquish her romantic fantasies also reveals women's collusion in their oppression through false and damaging <a href="sensibility">sentimentalism</a>. The novel pioneered the celebration of female sexuality and cross-class identification between women. Such themes, coupled with the publication of Godwin's scandalous "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs</a>" of Wollstonecraft's life, made the novel unpopular at the time it was published.

Twentieth-century <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist critics</a> embraced the work, integrating it into the history of the novel and feminist discourse. It is most often viewed as a fictionalized popularization of the "Rights of Woman", as an extension of Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in "Rights of Woman", and as autobiographical.

Wollstonecraft struggled to write "The Wrongs of Woman" for over a year; in contrast, she had dashed off "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790), her reply to <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke's</a> "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), in under a month and "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792) in six weeks. Godwin comments:

She was sensible how arduous a task it is to produce a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote many parts of the work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.

She also researched the book more than her others. By assuming the responsibilities of fiction editor and reviewing almost nothing but novels, she used her editorial position at <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson's</a> "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>" to educate herself regarding novelistic techniques. She even visited <a href="Bethlem%20Royal%20Hospital">Bedlam Hospital</a> in February 1797 to research insane asylums.

At Wollstonecraft's death in 1797, the manuscript was incomplete. Godwin published all of the pieces of the manuscript in the "Posthumous Works", adding several sentences and paragraphs of his own to link disjunct sections.

"The Wrongs of Woman" begins "<a href="in%20medias%20res">in medias res</a>" with the upper-class Maria's unjust imprisonment by her husband, George Venables. Not only has he condemned Maria to live in an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his <a href="marginalia">marginalia</a>. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.

Jemima tells her life story to Maria and Darnford, explaining that she was born a <a href="illegitimacy">bastard</a>. Jemima's mother died while she was still an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later <a href="indentured%20servant">bound out as an apprentice</a> to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.

In chapters seven through fourteen (about half of the completed manuscript), Maria relates her own life story in a narrative she has written for her daughter. She explains how her mother and father loved their eldest son, Robert, more than their other children and how he ruled "despotically" over his siblings. To escape her unhappy home, Maria visited that of a neighbor and fell in love with his son, George Venables. Venables presented himself to everyone as a respectable and honorable young man; in actuality, he was a <a href="libertine">libertine</a>. Maria's family life became untenable when her mother died and her father took the housekeeper as his mistress. A rich uncle who was fond of Maria, unaware of Venables' true character, arranged a marriage for her and gave her a <a href="dowry">dowry</a> of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>5,000.

Maria quickly learned of her husband's true character. She tried to ignore him by cultivating a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce are discussed in the novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.

The fragmentary notes for the remainder of the novel indicate two different trajectories for the plot and five separate conclusions. In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and takes another mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an abortion or a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft herself had done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form a new family.

In her pieces for the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", Wollstonecraft developed a set of criteria for what constitutes a good novel:

A good tragedy or novel, if the criterion be the effect which it has on the reader, is not always the most moral work, for it is not the reveries of sentiment, but the struggles of passion — of those "human passions", that too frequently cloud the reason, and lead "mortals" into dangerous errors ... which raise the most lively emotions, and leave the most lasting impression on the memory; an impression rather made by the heart than the understanding: for our affections are not quite voluntary as the suffrages of reason. (emphasis Wollstonecraft's)

Wollstonecraft believed that novels should be "probable" and depict "moderation, reason, and contentment". Thus it is surprising that "The Wrongs of Woman" draws inspiration from works such as <a href="Ann%20Radcliffe">Ann Radcliffe</a>'s "<a href="A%20Sicilian%20Romance">A Sicilian Romance</a>" (1790) and relies on <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> conventions such as the literal and figurative "mansion of despair" to which Maria is consigned. But it does so to demonstrate that gothic horrors are a reality for the average Englishwoman. Using elements of the gothic, Wollstonecraft can, for example, portray Maria's husband as tyrannical and married life as wretched. As Wollstonecraft herself writes in the "Preface" to "The Wrongs of Woman":

In many instances I could have made the incidents more dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, the desire of exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society.

One model for Wollstonecraft's novel was Godwin's "<a href="Caleb%20Williams">Caleb Williams</a>" (1794), which demonstrated how an adventurous and gothic novel could offer a social critique.

"The Wrongs of Woman" usually uses <a href="third-person%20narrative">third-person narration</a>, although large sections of Maria's and Jemima's tales are in <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrative</a>. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of <a href="free%20indirect%20discourse">free indirect discourse</a>, which blurs the line between the third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.

"The Wrongs of Woman" is what in the late eighteenth century was called a <a href="Jacobin%20novel">Jacobin novel</a>, a <a href="philosophical%20novel">philosophical novel</a> that advocated the ideals of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Wollstonecraft's novel argues along with others, such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays's</a> "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20Emma%20Courtney">Memoirs of Emma Courtney</a>" (1796), that women are the victims of constant and systematic injustice. Wollstonecraft uses the philosophical dialogues in her novel to demonstrate women's powerlessness.

Like other Jacobin novels, "The Wrongs of Woman" relies on a web of suggestive character names to convey its message: Jemima is named for <a href="Job%20%28Bible%29">Job</a>'s daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Lord%20Darnley">Henry Darnley</a>, the second husband of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George, Prince of Wales</a>. Wollstonecraft added to the reality of her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20plays">Shakespeare</a>, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. "The Wrongs of Woman" comments on the state of women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding's</a> "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Tom%20Jones%2C%20a%20Foundling">Tom Jones</a>"; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel more palatable to the public.

At the end of the "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Rights of Woman</a>" Wollstonecraft promised her readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another philosophical treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled "The Wrongs of Woman". In her "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of "woman" and not the story of an "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> has phrased it, "the wrongs done "to" women and the wrongs done "by" women" (emphasis Mellor's). The wrongs done "to" women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the wrongs done "by" women include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, "" (1788), "The Wrongs of Woman" offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.

In metaphors carried over from the "Rights of Woman", Wollstonecraft describes marriage as a prison and women as slaves within it in "The Wrongs of Woman". In the first chapter Maria laments, "[is] not the world a vast prison, and women born slaves?" and later she makes a politically charged allusion to the French prison, the <a href="Bastille">Bastille</a>: "marriage had bastilled me for life". Moreover, Maria's body is bought and sold like a slave's: she is worth <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>5,000 on the open marriage market and her new husband attempts to sell her into prostitution. Commenting on her condition, Maria states: "a wife being as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass, she has nothing she can call her own". In the "Rights of Woman", Wollstonecraft had used the metaphor of slavery not only to describe the horrors of marriage as it currently existed but also to offer a juxtaposition to the possibility of a new kind of marriage, one which assumed equality between affectionate and rational partners. In "The Wrongs of Woman", this option is never presented; instead, the reader is shown a series of disastrous marriages in which women are abused, robbed, and abandoned.

"Wollstonecraft's fundamental insight in "Maria"", according to scholar Mary Poovey, "concerns the way in which female sexuality is defined or interpreted—and, by extension, controlled—by bourgeois institutions. The primary agent of this control is marriage". Wollstonecraft deconstructs the ideology of marriage, by which women are exchangeable commodities, are objectified, and are denied their natural rights.

<a href="Sensibility">Sensibility</a> in the second half of the eighteenth century was considered both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as <a href="Abolitionism%23Britain">the movement to abolish the slave trade</a>, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing "The Wrongs of Woman", sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years. Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as "profoundly separatist"; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling. Sensibility seemed to many, particularly during a time of political reaction, to offer too much political power to women and to emasculate British men <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">needed for fighting France</a>.

All of Wollstonecraft's writings betray a tortured relationship with the language of sensibility and "The Wrongs of Woman" is no exception. As <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist scholar</a> Mitzi Myers has observed, Wollstonecraft is usually described as an "enlightened philosopher strenuously advocating the cultivation of reason as the guide to both self-realization and social progress", but her works do not unambiguously support such a model of selfhood. Her emphasis on "feeling, imagination, and interiority" mark her as a <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a>, particularly in "<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" (1796). Repeatedly, in both her fiction and non-fiction, Wollstonecraft argues that the proper understanding of one's emotions leads to a transcendent virtue.

However, because Wollstonecraft herself is contradictory and vague in the unfinished "Wrongs of Woman", there is no real scholarly consensus on what exactly the novel says about sensibility. Wollstonecraft is intentionally breaking the conventions of <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental fiction</a>, but exactly what her goals are in doing so is unclear. For example, Maria and Jemima can seemingly be identified with the traditional categories of "reason" (Jemima) and "sensibility" (Maria), but since such couples were usually male and female, Wollstonecraft's characterization challenges conventional definitions of gender.

Some critics interpret Maria's story ironically, arguing that the juxtaposition of Maria's sentimental and romantic narrative with Jemima's harsh and bleak narrative encourages such a reading. In this interpretation, Maria's narrative is read as a <a href="parody">parody</a> of sentimental fiction that aims to demonstrate the "wrongs" that women inflict upon themselves when they overindulge in sensibility. Although Wollstonecraft promotes sensibility in this text, it is not the same kind that she condemns in the "Rights of Woman"; proper sensibility, she contends, rests on <a href="The%20Theory%20of%20Moral%20Sentiments">sympathy</a> and, most importantly, is controlled by reason. A woman with this kind of sensibility would not be "blown about by every gust of momentary feeling". Other critics see "The Wrongs of Woman" as a "negation" of the anti-sentimental arguments offered in the "Rights of Woman". Citing Jemima's infrequent appearances in the narrative and the narrator's own use of the language of sensibility, they have difficulty in accepting the claim that the novel is undercutting or questioning the rhetoric of sensibility.

One of the key differences between Wollstonecraft's novels and her philosophical treatises, as feminist critic Cora Kaplan has argued, is that her fiction values female emotion while her treatises present it as "reactionary and regressive, almost counter-revolutionary". The "Rights of Woman" portrays sexuality as a masculine characteristic, and while Wollstonecraft argues that some masculine characteristics are universal, this is not one of them. In "The Wrongs of Woman", however, she accepts, relishes, and uses the sexualized female body as a medium of communication: Maria embraces her lust for Darnford and establishes a relationship with him. While in the "Rights of Woman" she had emphasized companioniate relationships, arguing that passions should cool between lovers, in "The Wrongs of Woman", she celebrates those passions. Challenging contemporary moralists such as <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28moralist%29">John Gregory</a> and <a href="Rousseau">Rousseau</a>, Wollstonecraft claimed that women could be fully sexualized beings.

Initially, Maria wants to marry Venables because of his charitable nature; she believes him to be the <a href="romantic%20hero">romantic hero</a> that she has read about in novels. However, she later realizes his duplicity:

[George] continued to single me out at the dance, press my hand at parting, and utter expressions of unmeaning passion, to which I gave a meaning naturally suggested by the romantic turn of my thoughts. ... When he left us, the colouring of my picture became more vivid—Whither did not my imagination lead me? In short, I fancied myself in love—in love with the disinterestedness, fortitude, generosity, dignity, and humanity, with which I had invested the hero I dubbed.

One of the important questions raised by the novel is whether Maria is deluded in her relationship with Darnford. Maria writes an autobiography for her daughter in which she admits that she was misled by Venables, but critics disagree over the extent to which she is also misled by Darnford. Some suggest that Maria repeats her mistake and imagines Darnford as a hero, citing as evidence Maria's refusal to leave the madhouse, when she is free to do so, because she wants to remain with him, as well as her infatuation with Rousseau's novel "<a href="Julie%2C%20or%20the%20New%20Heloise">Julie, or the New Heloise</a>". She imagines Darnford as its "hero", St. Preux, the sometime lover but not husband of Julie. Maria's reading and the plots she conjures in her imagination as a result of that reading are the cause of her downfall in this interpretation: unable or unwilling to separate fiction from reality, she incorporates Darnford into her romantic fantasies. Other critics, while agreeing that Maria is led astray by Darnford, argue that it is not her sexuality and eroticism that are the problem, but her choice of partner. They argue that Wollstonecraft is not portraying female sexuality as inherently detrimental, as she had in "Mary" and the "Rights of Woman", rather she is criticizing the directions it often takes.

The structure of "The Wrongs of Woman", with its interwoven tales of the similarly abused upper-middle-class Maria, the lower-middle-class sailor's wife Peggy, the working-class shopkeeper, the boarding-house owner, and the working-class domestic servant Jemima, is an "unprecedented" representation of the shared concerns of women in a patriarchal society. Wollstonecraft wrote in a letter, published as part of the preface to "The Wrongs of Woman", that she aimed "to show the wrongs of different classes of women, equally oppressive, though, from the difference of education, necessarily various". Her novel is newly inclusive and one of the first works in the <a href="List%20of%20feminist%20literature">history of feminist literature</a> that hints at a cross-class argument that women of different economic positions have the same interests "because" they are women. In her narration, Jemima asks "who ever risked anything for me?—Who ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?" It is not until Maria grasps her hand in sympathy that she feels this; furthermore, it is Jemima's story that first prods Maria's own "thoughts [to] take a wider range" and "thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate and her own, she was led to consider the oppressed state of women, and to lament that she had given birth to a daughter".

Jemima is the most fleshed out of the lower-class women in the novel; through her Wollstonecraft refuses to accept the submissiveness traditionally associated with femininity and expresses a frustrated anger that would have been viewed as unseemly in Maria. Jemima's tale also challenges assumptions regarding prostitutes. Wollstonecraft rewrites the traditional narrative of the redeemed prostitute (e.g., <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe's</a> "Some Considerations on Streetwalkers" (1726)). The novel presents prostitutes as "an exploited class", akin to wives who are dependent on men, and demonstrates how they are a product of their environment. By making both Jemima and Maria prostitutes, Wollstonecraft rejects two contemporary stereotypes of the prostitute: the image of the woman who takes pleasure in her actions and is in love with her keeper and the image of the victim desirous of pity. Thus, rather than simply repulsing or eliciting the compassion of the reader, Jemima and Maria presumably forge a stronger, more lasting bond with the female reader who shares their plight.

Nevertheless, Jemima's tale still retains elements of Wollstonecraft's <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> ethos; Jemima and the other working-class women are only presented as Maria's equal in suffering; "women are linked across class, then, but less in solidarity than in hopelessness." As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor comments, "Maria's relationship with Jemima displays something of the class fissures and prejudices that have marked organised feminist politics from their inception." Jemima is taught to appreciate the finer things in life when she is a kept mistress and Maria later promises to care for her. Importantly, though, in one version of the ending, it is Jemima who rescues Maria and finds her child.

While some scholars emphasize "The Wrongs of Woman"'s criticism of the institution of marriage and the laws restricting women in the eighteenth century, others focus on the work's description of "the experience of "being" female, with the emotional violence and intellectual debilitation" that accompanies it (emphasis in original). It is in Wollstonecraft's depiction of a female mind educating itself and creating a specifically feminine sense of self that she "breaks new ground". Maria's role as mother allows her to instruct herself, thereby creating her own sense of self; in advising her daughter through the manuscript she is writing, Maria learns about herself and realizes her past errors. Her ability to formulate her own selfhood can be contrasted to the heroine of Wollstonecraft's first novel, "", who transfers her maternal cravings from character to character.

Furthermore, while patriarchal marriages are one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard physical labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.

Because male-female relationships are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours to formulate a new kind of friendship in "The Wrongs of Woman": motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's <a href="pathos">pathetic</a> story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of a new kind of family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a>.

While more recent critics have emphasized the revolutionary aspects of the cross-class friendship between Jemima and Maria, others have questioned the extent of that radicalism, arguing that Jemima's story occupies a small section of the novel and is abruptly truncated. Mary Poovey also maintains that Wollstonecraft fails to extend her critique of marriage and society from the individual to the systemic level.

Like Wollstonecraft's first novel, "", "The Wrongs of Woman" is heavily autobiographical; the two novels even repeat many of the same biographical details. After being abandoned by her lover and the father of her child, <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a> (the model for Darnford), Wollstonecraft attempted to commit suicide. Her despair over these events is written into the book as well as many other experiences from the mid-1790s. Moreover, Maria Venables's family history shows clear similarities to Wollstonecraft's own. Like Maria, Wollstonecraft had a mother who favored an elder brother and she also devotedly cared for that mother during her dying days, only to be pushed away during the final moments of her life. Wollstonecraft also looked after her sisters like Maria does, albeit without the help of a wealthy uncle. Perhaps most strikingly, Wollstonecraft's sister Eliza left her husband, at Wollstonecraft's prodding, much as Maria leaves hers. As Kelly explains, autobiography is common in <a href="Jacobin%20novel">Jacobin novel</a>s. Philosophical novels were expected to be autobiographical; audiences believed that the philosophizing novelists would draw on their own experiences in order to illustrate their abstract principles.

The "Posthumous Works", of which "The Wrongs of Woman" was the largest part, had a "reasonably wide audience" when it was published in 1798, but it "was received by critics with almost universal disfavor". This was in large part because the simultaneous release of Godwin's "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" revealed Wollstonecraft's illegitimate child and her love affairs. Most reviewers and readers transferred the unconventional and unorthodox life Wollstonecraft herself had lived onto Maria and much that Maria had said and done onto Wollstonecraft, thereby realizing Wollstonecraft's fears that her books would be read only as a mirror of her life. The eighteenth-century moralist <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>, for example, called "The Wrongs of Woman" a "vindication of adultery".

Many critics and even personal acquaintances failed to grasp Wollstonecraft's fundamental point, that Maria's "wrongs" are political, not personal. She wrote to one friend who had criticized it:

I am vexed and surprised at your not thinking the situation of Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting that you are a man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.

Even Godwin, her husband, complained, "I do not want a common-place story of a brutal, insensible husband." Both the "<a href="Anti-Jacobin%20Review">Anti-Jacobin Review</a>" and the "Monthly Review" reviewed the novel harshly. The "Anti-Jacobin Review", attacking both Wollstonecraft and her book as well as Godwin's "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" and "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs</a>", wrote:

"The restrictions upon adultery" constitute, in Maria's opinion, A MOST FLAGRANT WRONG TO WOMEN. Such is the moral tendency of this work, such are the lessons which may be learned from the writings of Mrs. Wollstonecraft; such the advantages which the public may derive from this performance given to the world by Godwin, celebrated by him, and perfectly consonant to the principles of "his" Political Justice.—But as there have been writers, who have in theory promulgated opinions subversive of morality, yet in their conduct have not been immoral, Godwin has laboured to inform the world, that the theory of Mrs. Wollstonecraft was reduced to practice; that she lived and acted, as she wrote and taught.[Footnote in original: We could point out some of this lady's "pupils", who have so far profited by the instructions received from her, as to imitate her conduct, and reduce her principles to practice.] (emphasis in original)

Under the heading "Prostitution" in the index to the magazine, the editors listed only one entry: Mary Wollstonecraft. Partially because of these reactions, female sexuality would not be celebrated so overtly in Britain for another century.

While Wollstonecraft's arguments in "The Wrongs of Woman" may appear commonplace in light of modern feminism, they were "breathtakingly audacious" during the late eighteenth century: "Wollstonecraft's final novel made explosively plain what the "Rights of Woman" had only partially intimated: that women's entitlements — as citizens, mothers, and sexual beings — are incompatible with a patriarchal marriage system." However, while "The Wrongs of Woman" is now read as the progenitor of many feminist texts and the inspiration for many feminist arguments and rhetorical styles (e.g., the personal confession), Wollstonecraft herself was not part of a <a href="feminist%20movement">feminist movement</a> nor did she ever argue for one. Although "The Wrongs of Woman" presents "woman" as "wronged", neither Wollstonecraft nor any other British woman who highlighted the inequalities suffered by women at the time (such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a> or <a href="Mary%20Robinson">Mary Robinson</a>) ever put forth a collective solution. As part of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, they were dedicated to individualistic solutions.

Thoughts on the Education of Daughters

Thoughts on the education of daughters: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life is the first published work of the British <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. Published in <a href="1787%20in%20literature">1787</a> by her friend <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, "Thoughts" is a <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> that offers advice on <a href="female%20education">female education</a> to the emerging British <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, such as how to care for an infant.

An early version of the modern <a href="self-help%20book">self-help book</a>, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was an explosion in the number of conduct books published during the second half of the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published "Thoughts". However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a> in the 1970s.

Like other conduct books of the time, "Thoughts" adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book encourages mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for women—a role that she viewed as meaningful—was interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.

Although much of "Thoughts" is devoted to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few passages anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.

Like many impoverished women during the last quarter of the 18th century in Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted to support herself by establishing a school. She, her sister, and a close friend founded a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in <a href="Newington%20Green">Newington Green</a>, a village already known for its <a href="Dissenting%20academies">Dissenting academies</a>, including that of political theorist and educational reformer <a href="James%20Burgh">James Burgh</a>, whose widow acted as "<a href="fairy%20godmother">fairy godmother</a>" in helping Wollstonecraft to find a house and pupils. However, in the late 1780s the school closed because of financial difficulties, and, desperate to escape from debt, Wollstonecraft wrote her first book, "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters". The title alludes to Burgh's "Thoughts on Education" (1747), which in turn alludes to <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>'s 1693 work, "<a href="Some%20Thoughts%20Concerning%20Education">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</a>". She sold the <a href="copyright">copyright</a> for only ten <a href="guineas">guineas</a> to <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, a publisher recommended to her by a friend; they became friends and he encouraged her writing throughout her life.
Wollstonecraft next tried her hand at being a <a href="governess">governess</a>, but she chafed at her lowly position and refused to accommodate herself to her employers. The modest success of "Thoughts" and Johnson's encouragement emboldened Wollstonecraft to embark on a career as a professional writer, a precarious and somewhat disreputable profession for women during the 18th century. She wrote to her sister that she was going to become the "first of a new genus" and published "", an autobiographical novel, in 1788.

Addressed to mothers, young women, and teachers, "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters" explains how to educate a woman from infancy through marriage. Its twenty-one chapters are not arranged in any particular order and cover a wide variety of topics. The first two chapters, "The Nursery" and "Moral Discipline", offer advice on shaping the child's "constitution" and "temperament", arguing that the formation of the rational mind must begin early. These chapters also offer specific recommendations regarding the care of infants and endorse <a href="History%20of%20breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> (a hotly debated topic in the 18th century). Much of the book criticizes what Wollstonecraft considers the damaging education usually offered to women: "artificial manners", card-playing, theatre-going, and an emphasis on fashion. She complains, for example, that women "squander" their money on clothing, "which if saved for charitable purposes, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften the heart of the girl who entered into such scenes of woe". She contrasts this common but ineffectual education with one based on early childhood reading, benevolence, and love. Wollstonecraft also delved into a description of social issues, addressing the "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" in addition to the "Treatment of Servants". Religious faith plays a prominent role in Wollstonecraft's educational plan; she advocates <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Christianity">Sabbath observance</a> and describes the "Benefits which arise from Disappointments", that is, the benefits which arise from suffering sent by God.

In her later works, such as "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790) and "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), Wollstonecraft repeatedly returns to the topics addressed in "Thoughts", particularly the virtue of hard work and the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.

Between 1760 and 1820, <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a>s reached the height of their popularity in Britain; one scholar refers to the period as "the age of courtesy books for women". As <a href="Nancy%20Armstrong">Nancy Armstrong</a> writes in her seminal work on this genre, "Desire and Domestic Fiction" (1987): "so popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed".

Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description of (most often) the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined "proper" etiquette. Typical examples include <a href="Blue%20Stockings%20Society">Bluestocking</a> <a href="Hester%20Chapone">Hester Chapone's</a> "<a href="Letters%20on%20the%20Improvement%20of%20the%20Mind">Letters on the Improvement of the Mind</a>" (1773), which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the 18th century, and the classically educated historian <a href="Catharine%20Macaulay">Catharine Macaulay</a>'s "Letters on Education" (1790). Chapone's work, in particular, appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of "Thoughts" because it argued "for a sustained programme of study for women" and was based on the idea that Christianity should be "the chief instructor of our rational faculties". Moreover, it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism. When Wollstonecraft wrote "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" in 1792, she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works.

Conduct books have traditionally been viewed by scholars as an integral factor in the creation of a <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> sense of self. The conduct book "helped to generate the belief that there was such a thing as a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'". By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners. However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called "the angel in the house" image (alluding to <a href="Coventry%20Patmore">Coventry Patmore</a>'s <a href="The%20Angel%20in%20the%20House">poem of that name</a>). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.

More recently, a few scholars have argued that conduct books should be differentiated more carefully and that some of them—such as Wollstonecraft's "Thoughts"—transformed traditional female advice manuals into "proto-feminist tracts". These scholars view "Thoughts" as part of a tradition that adapted older genres to a new message of female empowerment, genres such as advice manuals for women's education, moral satires, and moral and spiritual works by religious <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenters</a> (those not associated with the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>). Wollstonecraft's text resembles conventional conduct books in promoting self-control and submission, traits that were supposed to attract a husband. Yet at the same time, the text challenges this portrait of the "proper lady" by introducing strains of religious Dissent that promote equality of the soul. Thus, "Thoughts" appears to be torn between several sets of binaries, such as compliance and rebellion; spiritual meekness and rational independence; and domestic duty and political participation. This view of the conduct book, and of "Thoughts" in particular, questions the earlier interpretation of the genre as a mere tool of ideological indoctrination, an interpretation that grew out of criticism influenced by theorists such as <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a>.

By the end of her life, Wollstonecraft had been involved in almost every arena of education: she had been a governess, a teacher, a children's writer, and a pedagogical theorist. Most of her works deal with education in some way. For example, her two novels are "<a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>e" (novels of education); she translated educational works such as <a href="Christian%20Gotthilf%20Salzmann">Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's</a> "Elements of Morality"; she wrote a children's book, "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788); and her "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" is largely an argument for the value of female education. As is evidenced by this broad range of genres, "education" for Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries included much more than scholastic training; it encompassed everything that went into forming a person's character, from infant <a href="swaddling">swaddling</a> to childhood curricular choices to adolescent leisure activities.

Wollstonecraft and other <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">political radicals</a> during the last quarter of the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenters</a>, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in "Thoughts" and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> and the minister <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a>. Dissenters "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to <a href="John%20Locke">Lockean</a> and <a href="David%20Hartley%20%28philosopher%29">Hartleian</a> <a href="association%20of%20ideas">associationist psychology</a>: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.

Wollstonecraft was significantly influenced by Locke's "<a href="Some%20Thoughts%20Concerning%20Education">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</a>" (1693) (her title alludes to it) and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s "<a href="Emile%2C%20or%20On%20Education">Emile</a>" (1762), the two most important pedagogical treatises of the 18th century. "Thoughts" follows in the Lockean tradition with its emphasis on a parent-directed domestic education, a distrust of servants, a banning of superstitious and irrational stories (e.g. <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s), and an advocacy of clear rules. Wollstonecraft breaks from Locke, however, in her emphasis on piety and her insistence that the child has "innate" feelings that guide her towards virtue, ideas likely drawn from Rousseau.

"Thoughts" advocates several educational goals for women: independent thought, rationality, self-discipline, truthfulness, acceptance of one's social position, marketable skills, and faith in God.

Wollstonecraft assumes that the "daughters" in her book will one day become mothers and teachers. She does not propose that women abandon these traditional roles, because she believes that women can most effectively improve society as pedagogues. Wollstonecraft and other writers as diverse as the <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> moralist <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>, the historian <a href="Catharine%20Macaulay">Catharine Macaulay</a>, and the feminist novelist <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a>, argue that since women are the primary caregivers of the family and educators of children, they should be given a sound education. "Thoughts" is insistent, following Locke and associationist psychology, that a poor education and an early marriage will ruin a woman. Wollstonecraft argues that if no attention is paid to girls as they are growing, they will turn out poorly and marry while still intellectual and emotional children. Such wives, she contends, perform no useful role in society and, indeed, contribute to its immorality. She expanded upon this argument five years later in "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>".
Wollstonecraft and others criticized the traditional "accomplishment"-based education traditionally offered women; they argued that this kind of education, which emphasized the acquisition of skills such as drawing and dancing, was useless and decadent. The ideal woman in "Thoughts" is, as Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, "rational, provident, realistic, self-disciplined, self-conscious and critical", an image that resembles that of the professional man. Wollstonecraft argues that women should have all of the intellectual and moral training given to men, though she does not provide women with a place to use these new skills beyond the home.

Wollstonecraft's feminist critics charged that the masculine role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more in the way of education without a real way to use it.

Wollstonecraft's most passionate writing in "Thoughts" focuses on the lack of career opportunities for women, a theme that would dominate her later novel "" (1798). In the chapter entitled "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" she writes, perhaps describing her own experiences:

[T]o be an humble companion to some rich old cousin... It is impossible to enumerate the many hours of anguish such a person must spend. Above the servants, yet considered by them as a spy, and ever reminded of her inferiority when in conversation with the superiors. … A teacher at a school is only a kind of upper servant, who has more work than the menial ones. A governess to young ladies is equally disagreeable. … life glides away, and the spirits with it; 'and when youth and genial years are flown,' they have nothing to subsist on; or, perhaps, on some extraordinary occasion, some small allowance may be made for them, which is thought a great charity. … It is hard for a person who has a relish for polished society, to herd with the vulgar, or to condescend to mix with her formal equals when she is considered in a different light... How cutting is the contempt she meets with!—A young mind looks round for love and friendship; but love and friendship fly from poverty: expect them not if you are poor!

Although Wollstonecraft's comments on female education hint at some of her more radical arguments in "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", the religious tone of the text—also found in her first novel, ""—is generally viewed by scholars as conservative. The religion presented in "Thoughts" is one that celebrates the "pleasures of resignation", the belief that the afterlife is awaiting and that the world is ordered by God for the best. Wollstonecraft writes:

He who is training us up for immortal bliss, knows best what trials will contribute to make us [virtuous]; and our resignation and improvement will render us respectable to ourselves, and to that Being, whose approbation is of more value than life itself.

Although she drifted away from these beliefs and later adopted a more permissive theology, "Thoughts" is "steeped in orthodox attitudes, advocating 'fixed principles of religion' and warning of the dangers of rationalist speculation and deism". Wollstonecraft even agrees with <a href="Rousseau">Rousseau</a> that women should be taught religious dogma rather than theology; clear rules, she maintains, will restrain their passions.

"Thoughts" was only moderately successful: it was reprinted in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> a year after its initial publication in London, extracts were published in "The Lady's Magazine", and Wollstonecraft included excerpts from it in her own "Female Reader" (1789), an anthology of writings designed "for the Improvement of Young Women". "<a href="English%20Review%20%2818th%20century%29">The English Review</a>" noticed "Thoughts" favourably:

These thoughts are employed on various important situations and incidents in the ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject; … while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention of those who are more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.

However, no other journal reviewed the book and "Thoughts" was not reprinted until the late 20th century, when there was a resurgence of interest in Wollstonecraft among <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary critics</a>.

Alan Richardson, a scholar of 18th-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790) and "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>", it is unlikely that "Thoughts" would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice. One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply trying to please the public. Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, they admit that the "potential for critique remains largely latent". "Thoughts" is therefore usually interpreted either <a href="teleology">teleologically</a>, as a first step towards the more radical "Rights of Woman", or dismissed as a "politically naïve potboiler" written prior to Wollstonecraft's conversion to radicalism while she was writing the "Rights of Men".

<doc id="11634630" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11634630" title="Volcanology of Io">
Volcanology of Io

The volcanology of Io, a <a href="Moons%20of%20Jupiter">moon of Jupiter</a>, is the scientific study of <a href="lava">lava</a> flows, <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> pits, and <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> (volcanic activity) on the surface of <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a>. Its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by "<a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a>" <a href="imaging%20science">imaging scientist</a> <a href="Linda%20Morabito">Linda Morabito</a>. Observations of <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a> by passing spacecraft (the "<a href="Voyager%20program">Voyagers</a>", "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>", "<a href="Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini</a>", and "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>") and Earth-based astronomers have revealed more than 150 active volcanoes. Up to 400 such volcanoes are predicted to exist based on these observations. Io's volcanism makes the satellite one of only four known currently volcanically active worlds in the Solar System (the other three being <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moon <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>'s moon <a href="Triton%20%28moon%29">Triton</a>).

First predicted shortly before the "Voyager 1" flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from <a href="tidal%20acceleration%23Tidal%20heating">tidal heating</a> produced by its forced <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a>. This differs from <a href="Geothermal%20%28geology%29">Earth's internal heating</a>, which is derived primarily from <a href="Radioactive%20decay">radioactive isotope decay</a> and <a href="gravitational%20binding%20energy">primordial heat of accretion</a>. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation in the shape of Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.

Io's volcanism has led to the formation of hundreds of volcanic centres and extensive lava formations, making it the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Three different <a href="types%20of%20volcanic%20eruptions">types of volcanic eruptions</a> have been identified, differing in duration, intensity, <a href="effusive%20eruption">lava effusion</a> rate, and whether the eruption occurs within a volcanic pit (known as a "patera"). Lava flows on Io, tens or hundreds of kilometres long, have primarily <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic composition, similar to lavas seen on Earth at <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es such as <a href="K%C4%ABlauea">Kīlauea</a> in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Although most of the lava on Io is made of basalt, a few lava flows consisting of sulfur and sulfur dioxide have been seen. In addition, eruption temperatures as high as were detected, which can be explained by the eruption of high-temperature <a href="ultramafic">ultramafic</a> silicate lavas.

As a result of the presence of significant quantities of sulfurous materials in Io's crust and on its surface, some eruptions propel sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas, and <a href="tephra">pyroclastic material</a> up to into space, producing large, umbrella-shaped volcanic plumes. This material paints the surrounding terrain in red, black, and/or white, and provides material for Io's patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere. Spacecraft that have flown by Io since 1979 have observed numerous surface changes as a result of Io's volcanic activity.

Before the "Voyager 1" encounter with Io on March 5, 1979, Io was thought to be a dead world much like the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. The discovery of a cloud of sodium surrounding Io led to theories that the satellite would be covered in <a href="evaporite">evaporite</a>s.

Hints of discoveries to come arose from Earth-based <a href="infrared">infrared</a> observations taken in the 1970s. An anomalously high <a href="heat%20flux">thermal flux</a>, compared to the other <a href="Galilean%20moons">Galilean satellites</a>, was discovered during measurements taken at an infrared wavelength of 10 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> while Io was in Jupiter's shadow. At the time, this heat flux was attributed to the surface having a much higher <a href="Volumetric%20heat%20capacity%23Thermal%20inertia">thermal inertia</a> than <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a> and <a href="Ganymede%20%28moon%29">Ganymede</a>. These results were considerably different from measurements taken at wavelengths of 20 μm, which suggested that Io had similar surface properties to the other Galilean satellites. Robert Nelson and Bruce Hapke attempted to explain these features in Io's spectrum by suggesting <a href="fumarole">fumarolic</a> activity as a mechanism for producing short-chain sulphur allotropes on Io's surface. It has since been determined that the greater flux at shorter wavelengths was due to the combined flux from Io's volcanoes and solar heating, whereas solar heating provides a much greater fraction of the flux at longer wavelengths. A sharp increase in Io's thermal emission at 5 μm was observed on February 20, 1978 by Witteborn, "et al." The group considered volcanic activity at the time, in which case the data was fit into a region on Io in size at . However, the authors considered that hypothesis unlikely, and instead focused on emission from Io's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere.

Shortly before the "Voyager 1" encounter, <a href="Stanton%20J.%20Peale">Stan Peale</a>, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds published a paper in the journal "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" predicting a volcanically modified surface and a <a href="Io%20%28moon%29%23Interior">differentiated</a> interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested that the amount of heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive isotope decay</a> alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.
"Voyager 1"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> first images of Io revealed a lack of <a href="impact%20crater">impact crater</a>s, suggesting a very young surface. Craters are used by geologists to estimate the age of a <a href="Geology%20of%20solar%20terrestrial%20planets">planetary surface</a>; the number of impact structures increase with the age of the planetary surface. Instead, "Voyager 1" observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact craters. "Voyager 1" also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid and tall, isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested that, just as Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.

On March 8, 1979, three days after passing Jupiter, "Voyager 1" took images of Jupiter's moons to help mission controllers determine the spacecraft's exact location, a process called optical navigation. Although processing images of Io to enhance the visibility of background stars, navigation engineer <a href="Linda%20A.%20Morabito">Linda Morabito</a> found a tall cloud along its <a href="wikt%3Alimb">limb</a>. At first, she suspected the cloud to be a moon behind Io, but no suitably sized body would have been in that location. The feature was determined to be a plume generated by active volcanism at a dark depression later named <a href="Pele%20%28volcano%29">Pele</a>. Following this discovery, eight other plumes were located in "Voyager" images of Io. These plumes were later named after mythological deities associated with fire, volcanoes, or mayhem: <a href="Loki%20Patera">Loki</a> (two separate plumes), <a href="Prometheus%20%28volcano%29">Prometheus</a>, Volund, <a href="Amirani%20%28volcano%29">Amirani</a>, <a href="Maui%20Patera">Maui</a>, Marduk, and <a href="Masubi%20%28volcano%29">Masubi</a>. Thermal emission from multiple sources, indicative of cooling lava, were also found. Surface changes were observed when images acquired by "<a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>" were compared to those taken four months previously by "Voyager 1", including new plume deposits at <a href="Aten%20Patera">Aten Patera</a> and <a href="Surt%20%28volcano%29">Surt</a>.

Io's main source of internal heat comes from the <a href="tidal%20force">tidal force</a>s generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating differs from the <a href="Geothermal%20%28geology%29">internal heat source</a> for volcanism on Earth, which is a result of radioactive <a href="isotope">isotope</a> decay and residual heat from <a href="Accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accretion</a>. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive <a href="mantle%20convection">mantle convection</a>, which in turn causes volcanism through <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a>.

The tidal heating of Io is dependent on its distance from Jupiter, its <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a>, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its <a href="orbital%20resonance%23Mean%20motion%20resonances%20in%20the%20Solar%20System">Laplace orbital resonance</a> with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from <a href="tidal%20circularization">circularizing</a> its orbit. The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge of as much as as Jupiter's gravitational pull varies between the <a href="apsis">periapsis and apoapsis</a> points in Io's orbit. This varying tidal pull also produces friction in Io's interior, enough to cause significant tidal heating and melting. Unlike Earth, where most of its internal heat is released by conduction through the crust, on Io internal heat is released via volcanic activity and generates the satellite's high <a href="heat%20transfer">heat flow</a> (global total: 0.6–1.6 <a href="watt">W</a>). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time, and that the current heat flow is not representative of the long-term average. The observed release of heat from Io's interior is greater than estimates for the amount presently generated from tidal heating, suggesting that Io is cooling after a period of greater flexing.

Analysis of "Voyager" images led scientists to believe that the lava flows on Io were composed mostly of various <a href="Allotropes%20of%20sulfur">forms of molten elemental sulfur</a>. The colouration of the flows was found to be similar to its various <a href="allotropy">allotropes</a>. Differences in the lava colour and brightness are a function of the temperature of polyatomic sulfur and the packing and bonding of its atoms. An analysis of the flows that radiate out from <a href="List%20of%20paterae%20on%20Io">Ra Patera</a> revealed differently colored materials, all associated with liquid sulfur, at different distances from the vent: dark <a href="albedo">albedo</a> material close to the vent at , red material in the central part of each flow at , and orange material at the farthest ends of each flow at . This colour pattern corresponds to flows radiating out from a central vent, cooling as the lava travels away from it. In addition, temperature measurements of thermal emission at <a href="Loki%20Patera">Loki Patera</a> taken by "Voyager 1"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) instrument were consistent with sulfur volcanism. However, the IRIS instrument was not capable of detecting wavelengths that are indicative of higher temperatures. This meant that temperatures consistent with silicate volcanism were not discovered by "Voyager". Despite this, "Voyager" scientists deduced that <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s must play a role in Io's youthful appearance, from its high density and the need for silicates to support the steep slopes along patera walls. The contradiction between the structural evidence and the spectral and temperature data following the "Voyager" flybys led to a debate in the planetary science community regarding the composition of Io's lava flows, whether they were composed of silicate or sulfurous materials.

Earth-based infrared studies in the 1980s and 1990s shifted the paradigm from one of primarily sulfur volcanism to one where silicate volcanism dominates, and sulfur acts in a secondary role. In 1986, measurements of a bright eruption on Io's leading hemisphere revealed temperatures of at least . This is higher than the boiling point of sulfur (), indicating a silicate composition for at least some of Io's lava flows. Similar temperatures were also observed at the Surt eruption in 1979 between the two "Voyager" encounters, and at the eruption observed by Witteborn and colleagues in 1978. In addition, modeling of silicate lava flows on Io suggested that they cooled rapidly, causing their thermal emission to be dominated by lower temperature components, such as solidified flows, as opposed to the small areas covered by still molten lava near the actual eruption temperature.
Silicate volcanism, involving basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic (<a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>-rich) compositions, was confirmed by the "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" spacecraft in the 1990s and 2000s from temperature measurements of Io's numerous hot spots, locations where thermal emission is detected, and from spectral measurements of Io's dark material. Temperature measurements from "Galileo"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Solid-State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) revealed numerous hot spots with high-temperature components ranging from at least to a maximum of , like at the <a href="Pillan%20Patera">Pillan Patera</a> eruption in 1997. Initial estimates during the course of the "Galileo" mission suggesting eruption temperatures approaching have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to calculate the temperatures. Spectral observations of Io's dark material suggested the presence of <a href="pyroxene">orthopyroxenes</a>, such as <a href="enstatite">enstatite</a>, magnesium-rich silicate minerals common in mafic and ultramafic basalt. This dark material is seen in volcanic pits, fresh lava flows, and <a href="pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic</a> deposits surrounding recent, explosive volcanic eruptions. Based on the measured temperature of the lava and the spectral measurements, some of the lava may be analogous to terrestrial <a href="komatiite">komatiite</a>s. Compressional superheating, which could increase the temperature of magma during ascent to the surface during an eruption, may also be a factor in some of the higher temperature eruptions.

Although temperature measurements of Io's volcanoes settled the sulfur-versus-silicates debate that persisted between the "Voyager" and "Galileo" missions at Jupiter, sulfur and sulfur dioxide still play a significant role in the phenomena observed on Io. Both materials have been detected in the plumes generated at Io's volcanoes, with sulfur being a primary constituent of Pele-type plumes. Bright flows have been identified on Io, at Tsũi Goab Fluctus, Emakong Patera, and Balder Patera for example, that are suggestive of effusive sulfur or sulfur dioxide volcanism.

Observations of Io by spacecraft and Earth-based astronomers have led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include "intra-patera", "flow-dominated", and "explosion-dominated" eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and whether it is confined within volcanic pits.

"Intra-patera" eruptions occur within volcanic <a href="Depression%20%28geology%29">depressions</a> known as "paterae", which generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls. Paterae resemble terrestrial <a href="caldera">caldera</a>s, but it is unknown whether they form when an empty magma chamber collapses, like their terrestrial cousins. One hypothesis suggests that they are produced through the exhumation of volcanic <a href="Sill%20%28geology%29">sills</a>, with the overlying material either being blasted out or integrated into the sill. Some paterae display evidence for multiple collapses, similar to the calderas atop <a href="Olympus%20Mons">Olympus Mons</a> on <a href="Mars">Mars</a> or Kīlauea on Earth, suggesting that they may occasionally form like volcanic calderas. Because the formation mechanism is still uncertain, the general term for these features uses the Latin descriptor term employed by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in naming them, "paterae". Unlike similar features on Earth and Mars, these depressions generally do not lie at the peak of shield volcanoes and are larger, with an average diameter of . Patera depths have been measured for only a few paterae and typically exceed 1 km. The largest volcanic depression on Io is <a href="Loki%20Patera">Loki Patera</a> at across. Whatever the formation mechanism, the morphology and distribution of many paterae suggest that they are structurally controlled, with at least half bounded by faults or mountains.
This eruption style can take the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or <a href="lava%20lake">lava lake</a>s. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, it can be difficult to tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the <a href="Gish%20Bar%20Patera">Gish Bar Patera</a> eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like <a href="Camaxtli%20Patera">Camaxtli Patera</a>, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.

Ionian lava lakes are depressions partially filled with molten lava covered by a thin solidified crust. These lava lakes are directly connected to a magma reservoir lying below. Observations of thermal emission at several Ionian lava lakes reveal glowing molten rock along the patera margin, caused by the lake's crust breaking up along the edge of the patera. Over time, because the solidified lava is denser than the still-molten magma below, this crust can founder, triggering an increase in thermal emission at the volcano. For some lava lakes, like the one at Pele, this occurs continuously, making Pele one of the brightest emitters of heat in the near-infrared spectrum on Io. At other sites, such as at Loki Patera, this can occur episodically. During an overturning episode at these more quiescent lava lakes, a wave of foundering crust spreads out across the patera at the rate of about per day, with new crust forming behind it until the entire lake has been resurfaced. Another eruption would only begin once the new crust has cooled and thickened enough for it to no longer be buoyant over the molten lava. During an overturning episode, Loki can emit up to ten times more heat than when its crust is stable.

"Flow-dominated" eruptions are long-lived events that build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In this style of eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents on the floor of paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from <a href="Fissure%20vent">fissures</a> on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the "Galileo" spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at <a href="Prometheus%20%28volcano%29">Prometheus</a> and <a href="Amirani%20%28volcano%29">Amirani</a>, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.

Active flow fields more than long have been observed on Io at Amirani and Masubi. A relatively inactive flow field named <a href="Lei-Kung%20Fluctus">Lei-Kung Fluctus</a> covers more than , an area slightly larger than <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. The thickness of flow fields was not determined by Galileo, but the individual breakouts on their surface are likely to be thick. In many cases, active lava breakouts flow out onto the surface at locations tens to hundreds of kilometres from the source vent, with low amounts of thermal emission observed between it and the breakout. This suggests that lava flows through <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s from the source vent to the breakout.

Although these eruptions generally have a steady eruption rate, larger outbreaks of lava have been observed at many flow-dominated eruption sites. For example, the leading edge of the Prometheus flow field moved between observations by "Voyager" in 1979 and "Galileo" in 1996. Although generally dwarfed by explosion-dominated eruptions, the average flow rate at these compound flow fields is much greater than what is observed at similar contemporary lava flows on Earth. Average surface coverage rates of per second were observed at Prometheus and Amirani during the "Galileo" mission, compared to per second at Kīlauea.

"Explosion-dominated" eruptions are the most pronounced of Io's eruption styles. These eruptions, sometimes called "outburst" eruptions from their Earth-based detections, are characterized by their short duration (lasting only weeks or months), rapid onset, large volumetric flow rates, and high thermal emission. They lead to a short-lived, significant increase in Io's overall brightness in the near-infrared. The most powerful volcanic eruption observed in historical times was an "outburst" eruption at <a href="Surt%20%28volcano%29">Surt</a>, observed by Earth-based astronomers on February 22, 2001.

Explosion-dominated eruptions occur when a body of magma (called a "<a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dike</a>") from deep within Io's partially molten <a href="Mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a> reaches the surface at a fissure. This results in a spectacular display of <a href="lava%20fountain">lava fountain</a>s. During the beginning of the outburst eruption, thermal emission is dominated by strong, 1–3 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> infrared radiation. It is produced by a large amount of exposed, fresh lava within the fountains at the eruption source vent. Outburst eruptions at Tvashtar in November 1999 and February 2007 centred on a long, tall lava "curtain" produced at a small patera nested within the larger Tvashtar Paterae complex.

The large amount of exposed molten lava at these lava fountains has provided researchers with their best opportunity to measure the actual temperatures of Ionian lavas. Temperatures suggestive of an ultramafic lava composition similar to <a href="Pre-Cambrian">Pre-Cambrian</a> <a href="komatiite">komatiite</a>s (about ) are dominant at such eruptions, though superheating of the magma during ascent to the surface cannot be ruled out as a factor in the high eruption temperatures.
Although the more explosive, lava-fountaining stage may last only a few days to a week, explosion-dominated eruptions can continue for weeks to months, producing large, voluminous silicate lava flows. A major eruption in 1997 from a <a href="fissure">fissure</a> north-west of <a href="Pillan%20Patera">Pillan Patera</a> produced more than of fresh lava over a - to -month period, and later flooded the floor of Pillan Patera. Observations by "Galileo" suggest lava coverage rates at Pillan between per second during the 1997 eruption. The Pillan flow was found to be thick, compared to the thick flows observed at the inflated fields at Prometheus and Amirani. Similar, rapidly emplaced lava flows were observed by "Galileo" at Thor in 2001. Such flow rates are similar to those seen at <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>'s <a href="Laki%231783%20eruption">Laki eruption</a> in 1783 and in terrestrial flood basalt eruptions.

Explosion-dominated eruptions can produce dramatic (but often short-lived) surface changes around the eruption site, such as large pyroclastic and plume deposits produced as gas <a href="Exsolution">exsolves</a> from lava fountains. The 1997 Pillan eruption produced a wide deposit of dark, silicate material and bright sulfur dioxide. The Tvashtar eruptions of 2000 and 2007 generated a tall plume that deposited a ring of red sulfur and sulfur dioxide wide. Despite the dramatic appearance of these features, without continuous resupply of material, the vent surroundings often revert to their pre-eruption appearance over a period of months (in the case of Grian Patera) or years (as at Pillan Patera).

The discovery of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional materials that might be found in the volcanic plumes include <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.

The most common type of volcanic plume on Io are dust plumes, or Prometheus-type plumes, produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the material skyward. Examples of Prometheus-type plumes include <a href="Prometheus%20%28volcano%29">Prometheus</a>, <a href="Amirani%20%28volcano%29">Amirani</a>, <a href="Zamama%20%28volcano%29">Zamama</a>, and <a href="Masubi%20%28volcano%29">Masubi</a>. These plumes are usually less than tall with eruption velocities around . Prometheus-type plumes are dust-rich, with a dense inner core and upper canopy <a href="Gas%20Dynamics%20Shocks">shock zone</a>, giving them an umbrella-like appearance. These plumes often form bright circular deposits, with a radius ranging between and consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide frost. Prometheus-type plumes are frequently seen at flow-dominated eruptions, helping make this plume type quite long-lived. Four out of the six Prometheus-type plumes observed by "Voyager 1" in 1979 were also observed throughout the "Galileo" mission and by "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" in 2007. Although the dust plume can be clearly seen in sunlit <a href="Visible%20spectrum">visible-light</a> images of Io acquired by passing spacecraft, many Prometheus-type plumes have an outer halo of fainter, more gas-rich material reaching heights approaching that of the larger, Pele-type plumes.

Io's largest plumes, Pele-type plumes, are created when sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas exsolve from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, carrying <a href="Tephra">silicate pyroclastic material</a> with them. The few Pele-type plumes that have been observed are usually associated with explosion-dominated eruptions, and are short-lived. The exception to this is <a href="Pele%20%28volcano%29">Pele</a>, which is associated with a long-lived active lava lake eruption, though the plume is thought to be intermittent. The higher vent temperatures and pressures associated with these plumes generate eruption speeds of up to , allowing them to reach heights of between . Pele-type plumes form red (from short-chain sulfur) and black (from silicate pyroclastics) surface deposits, including large -wide red rings, as seen at Pele. The erupted sulfurous components of Pele-type plumes are thought to be the result of an excess amount of sulfur in Io's crust and a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere. They are generally fainter than Prometheus-type plumes as a result of the low dust content, causing some to be called stealth plumes. These plumes are sometimes only seen in images acquired while Io is <a href="Eclipse">in the shadow of Jupiter</a> or those taken in <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>. The little dust that is visible in sunlit images is generated when sulfur and sulfur dioxide condense as the gases reach the top of their ballistic trajectories. That is why these plumes lack the dense central column seen in Prometheus-type plumes, in which dust is generated at the plume source. Examples of Pele-type plumes have been observed at Pele, Tvashtar, and Grian.

Super Science Stories

Super Science Stories was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> published by <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a> from 1940 and 1943, and again from 1949 to 1951. Popular launched it under their "Fictioneers" imprint, which they used for magazines paying writers less than one cent per word. <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> was hired in late 1939, at 19 years old, to edit the magazine; he also edited "<a href="Astonishing%20Stories">Astonishing Stories</a>", a companion science fiction publication. Pohl left in mid-1941, and "Super Science Stories" was given to <a href="Alden%20H.%20Norton">Alden H. Norton</a> to edit; a few months later Norton rehired Pohl as an assistant. Popular gave Pohl a very low budget, so most manuscripts submitted to "Super Science Stories" had already been rejected by the higher-paying magazines. This made it difficult to acquire good fiction, but Pohl was able to acquire stories for the early issues from the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of young <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> and aspiring writers.

"Super Science Stories" was an initial success, and within a year Popular increased Pohl's budget slightly, allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion. Pohl wrote many stories himself, to fill the magazine and to augment his salary. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>. After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of "Super Science Stories". The final issue of the first run was dated May of that year. In 1949 the title was revived with <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a> as editor; this version, which included many reprinted stories, lasted almost three years, with the last issue dated August 1951. A Canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both "Super Science Stories" and "Astonishing Stories"; it was unusual in that it printed some original fiction rather than just reprints. There were also Canadian and British reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine.

The magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre, but has received qualified praise from science fiction critics and historians. Science fiction historian Raymond Thompson describes it as "one of the most interesting magazines to appear during the 1940s", despite the variable quality of the stories. Critics <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a> and <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> comment that the magazine "had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground".

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming, and several new sf magazines were launched in 1939. <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, a science fiction fan and aspiring writer, visited Robert Erisman, the editor of "<a href="Marvel%20Science%20Stories">Marvel Science Stories</a>" and "<a href="Dynamic%20Science%20Stories">Dynamic Science Stories</a>", to ask for a job. Erisman did not have an opening for him, but told Pohl that <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, a leading pulp publisher, was starting a new line of low-paying magazines and might be interested in adding a science fiction title. On October 25, 1939, Pohl visited <a href="Rogers%20Terrill">Rogers Terrill</a> at Popular, and was hired immediately, at the age of nineteen, on a salary of ten dollars per week. Pohl was given two magazines to edit: "Super Science Stories" and "<a href="Astonishing%20Stories">Astonishing Stories</a>". "Super Science Stories" was intended to carry longer pieces, and "Astonishing" focused on shorter fiction; "Super Science Stories" was retitled "Super Science Novels Magazine" in March 1941, reflecting this policy, but after only three issues the title was changed back to "Super Science Stories".

Popular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. "Super Science Stories" first issue was dated March 1940; it was bimonthly, with "Astonishing Stories" appearing in the alternate months. In Pohl's memoirs he recalls <a href="Harry%20Steeger">Harry Steeger</a>, one of the company owners, breaking down the budget for "Astonishing" for him: "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." For "Super Science Stories", Steeger gave him an additional $50 as it was 16 pages longer, so his total budget was $455 per issue. Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. "Super Science Stories" sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources: Popular was a major pulp publisher and had a strong distribution network, which helped circulation. Steeger soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. Pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. Some of the additional money went to <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>, a long-established sf writer who came to see Pohl in person to submit his work. Cummings refused to sell for less than one cent a word; Pohl had some extra money available when Cummings first visited him, and though he disliked Cummings' work was never able to bring himself to reject Cummings submissions, or even to tell him that he could not really afford to pay the rate Cummings was asking. Pohl comments in his memoirs that "for months he [Cummings] would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all."

By reducing the space he needed to fill with fiction Pohl managed to stretch his budget. A long letter column took up several pages but required no payment, and neither did running advertisements for Popular's other magazines. Some authors sent inaccurate word counts with the stories they submitted, and savings were made by paying them on the basis of whichever word count was less—the author's or one done by Popular's staff. The result was a saving of forty to fifty dollars per issue. Snipped elements of black and white illustrations were also reused to fill space, as multiple uses of the same artwork did not require additional payments to the artist.

Towards the end of 1940 Popular doubled Pohl's salary to twenty dollars per week. In June 1941 Pohl visited Steeger to ask for a further raise, intending to resign and work as a free-lance writer if he was unsuccessful. Steeger was unreceptive, and Pohl commented later "I have never been sure whether I quit or got fired". Instead of replacing Pohl, Popular assigned editor-in-chief <a href="Alden%20H.%20Norton">Alden H. Norton</a> to add the magazines to his responsibilities. The arrangement lasted for seven months, after which Norton asked Pohl to return as his assistant. Norton offered Pohl thirty-five dollars a week as an associate editor, substantially more than the twenty dollars a week he had received as editor, and Pohl readily accepted.

Pohl was not eligible to be drafted for military service as he was married, but by the end of 1942 his marriage was over and he decided to enlist. As voluntary enlistment was suspended he was unable to immediately join the army, but eventually was inducted on April 1, 1943. Paper was difficult to obtain because of the war, and Popular decided to close the magazine down; the final issue, dated April 1943, was assembled with the assistance of <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a>.

In late 1948, as a second boom in science fiction publishing was beginning, Popular decided to revive the magazine. Jakobsson later recalled hearing about the revival while on vacation, swimming in a lake, five miles from a phone: "A boy on a bicycle showed on shore and shouted, 'Call your office. When he reached a phone, Norton told him that the magazine was being relaunched and would be given to Jakobsson to edit. <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>, who was working for Popular at the time, also worked on the magazine as assistant editor, although he was not credited. The relaunched magazine survived for almost three years, but the market for pulps was weak, and when Knight left in 1950 to edit "<a href="Worlds%20Beyond%20%28magazine%29">Worlds Beyond</a>" Jakobsson was unable to sustain support for it within Popular. It ceased publication with the August 1951 issue.

Because of the low rates of pay, the stories submitted to "Super Science Stories" in its first year had generally already been rejected elsewhere. However, Pohl was a member of the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of science fiction fans that included <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="C.M.%20Kornbluth">C.M. Kornbluth</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wilson%20%28author%29">Richard Wilson</a> and <a href="Donald%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a>; the Futurians were eager to become professional writers and were eager to submit stories to Pohl. The Futurians were prolific; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. Pohl contributed material himself, usually in collaboration with one or more of the Futurians. Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. The first story Pohl ever published that was not a collaboration was "The Dweller in the Ice", which appeared in the January 1941 "Super Science Stories". All of the stories Pohl bought from himself were published under pseudonyms, though in fact Pohl used pseudonyms for everything he wrote until the 1950s.

The first issue, dated March 1940, contained "Emergency Refueling", <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>'s first published story, two stories by <a href="John%20Russell%20Fearn">John Russell Fearn</a> (one under the pseudonym "Thornton Ayre"), fiction by <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a>, <a href="Ross%20Rocklynne">Ross Rocklynne</a>, <a href="Raymond%20Gallun">Raymond Gallun</a>, <a href="Harl%20Vincent">Harl Vincent</a> and Dean O'Brien; and a poem by Kornbluth, "The Song of the Rocket", under the pseudonym "Gabriel Barclay". Blish's most notable contribution to the magazine was "Sunken Universe", which appeared in the May 1942 issue under the pseudonym "Arthur Merlyn". This later formed part of "Surface Tension", one of Blish's most popular stories. Other writers whose first story appeared in "Super Science Stories" include <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href="Chad%20Oliver">Chad Oliver</a>, and <a href="Wilson%20Tucker">Wilson Tucker</a>. Bradbury's first sale, "Pendulum", was bought by Norton, and appeared in the November 1941 issue; Tucker's writing career began with "Interstellar Way Station" in May 1941, and Oliver's "The Land of Lost Content" appeared in the November 1950 "Super Science Stories". Asimov appeared four times in "Super Science Stories", starting with "Robbie", his first <a href="Robot%20series%20%28Asimov%29">"Robot" story</a>, under the title "Strange Playfellow".

Although most stories submitted to "Super Science Stories" were rejects from the better-paying markets such as "Astounding Science Fiction", Pohl recalled in his memoirs that <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>, the editor of "Astounding", would occasionally pass on a good story by a prolific author because he felt readers did not want to see the same authors in every issue. As a result, Pohl was able to print <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>'s "Genus Homo", in the March 1941 "Super Science Stories", and Robert Heinlein's "<a href="Let%20There%20Be%20Light%20%28Heinlein%20short%20story%29">Let There Be Light</a>" and "<a href="Lost%20Legacy">Lost Legacy</a>" in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues: these were stories which, in Pohl's opinion, "would have looked good anywhere". Pohl also suggested that Campbell rejected some of Heinlein's stories because they contained mild references to sex. A couple of readers did complain, with one disgusted letter writer commenting "If you are going to continue to print such pseudosophisticated, pre-prep-school tripe as "Let There Be Light", you should change the name of the mag to "Naughty Future Funnies"".

The second run of "Super Science Stories" included some fiction that had first appeared in the Canadian reprint edition, which outlasted the U.S. original and printed eleven stories that had been acquired but not printed by the time Popular shut "Super Science Stories" and "Astonishing" down in early 1943. These included "The Black Sun Rises" by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>, "And Then – the Silence", by Ray Bradbury, and "The Bounding Crown" by James Blish. From mid-1950 a reprint feature was established. This led to some reader complaints, with one correspondent pointing out that it was particularly galling to discover that Blish's "Sunken Universe", reprinted in the November 1950 issue, was a better story than the original material in the magazine. The magazine also reprinted stories from "<a href="Famous%20Fantastic%20Mysteries">Famous Fantastic Mysteries</a>", which Popular had acquired from <a href="Munsey%20%28publisher%29">Munsey Publishing</a> in 1941.

Some of the original stories were well-received: for example, Ray Bradbury's "The Impossible", which appeared in the November 1949 issue, and was later included in Bradbury's book "The Martian Chronicles", is described by sf historian Raymond Thompson as a "haunting ... comment on man's attempts to realize his conflicting hopes and dreams". Thompson also comments positively on <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s early story "Terminal Quest", in "Super Science Stories"s final issue, dated August 1951; and on <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "Exile of the Eons" in the March 1950 issue. <a href="John%20D.%20MacDonald">John D. MacDonald</a> also contributed good material.

The book reviews in "Super Science Stories" were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field, and historian Paul Carter regards "Astonishing" and "Super Science Stories" as the place where "book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term 'literary criticism, adding that "it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also". The artwork was initially amateurish, and although it improved over the years, even the better artists such as <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Lawrence Stevens</a> continued to produce cliched depictions of half-dressed women threatened by robots or aliens. <a href="H.%20R.%20van%20Dongen">H. R. van Dongen</a>, later a prolific cover artist for "Astounding", made his first science fiction art sale to "Super Science Stories" for the cover of the September 1950 issue.

Sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> regards "Super Science Stories" as marginally better than its companion magazine, "Astonishing", adding "both are a testament to what a good editor can do with a poor budget". According to sf critics Brian Stableford and Peter Nicholls, the magazine "had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground".

The first run of "Super Science Stories" was edited by Frederik Pohl from March 1940 through August 1941 (nine issues), and then by Alden H. Norton from November 1941 through May 1943 (seven issues). Ejler Jakobsson was the editor throughout the second run, from January 1949 to August 1951. The publisher was Popular Publications for both versions, although the first was issued under Popular's Fictioneers imprint. It was pulp-sized throughout both runs. At launch the magazine had 128 pages and was priced at 15 cents; the price increased to 20 cents when it went to 144 pages in March 1941, and again to 25 cents for the May 1943 issue, which had 128 pages again. The second run was priced at 25 cents throughout and had 112 pages. The title was "Super Science Stories" for both runs except for three issues from March to August 1941, which were titled "Super Science Novels Magazine". The volume numbering was completely regular, with seven volumes of four numbers and a final volume of three numbers. It was bimonthly for the first eight issues, from March 1940 to May 1941, and then went to a regular quarterly schedule.

In 1940, as part of the War Exchange Conservation Act, Canada banned the import of pulp magazines. Popular launched a Canadian edition of "Astonishing Stories" in January 1942, which lasted for three bimonthly issues and reprinted two issues of "Astonishing" and one issue of "Super Science Stories". With the August 1942 issue the name was changed to "Super Science Stories", and the numeration was begun again at volume 1 number 1; as a result the magazine is usually listed by bibliographers as a separate publication from the Canadian "Astonishing", but in many respects it was a direct continuation. The price was 15 cents throughout; it lasted for 21 regular bimonthly issues in a single volume; the last issue was dated December 1945. It was published by Popular Publications' Toronto branch, and the editor was listed as Alden H. Norton.

Each issue of the Canadian edition corresponded to one issue of either "Astonishing" or "Super Science": for example, the first two Canadian issues drew their contents from the February 1942 "Super Science Stories" and the June 1942 "Astonishing", respectively. This pattern continued for ten issues. The next issue, dated April 1944, contained several reprints from the US editions, but also included two original stories that had not appeared anywhere before—these had been acquired for the US magazine and remained in inventory. A total of eleven of these original stories appeared in the Canadian "Super Science Stories". Later issues of the magazine also saw many reprints from "Famous Fantastic Mysteries"; in tacit acknowledgement of the new source of material, the title was changed to "Super Science and Fantastic Stories" from the December 1944 issue. The artwork was mostly taken from Popular's US magazines but some new art appeared, probably by Canadian artists. There was no other Canadian presence: the letters page, for example, contained letters from the US edition.

In 1949, when the second run of the US "Super Science Stories" began, another Canadian edition appeared, but this was identical in content to the US version. Two British reprint editions of the second run also appeared, starting in October 1949. The first was published by <a href="Thorpe%20%26amp%3B%20Porter">Thorpe & Porter</a>; the issues, which were not dated or numbered, appeared in October 1949 and February and June 1950. The contents were drawn from the US issues dated January 1949, November 1949, and January 1950 respectively; each was 96 pages and was priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">1/-</a>. The second reprint edition was published by Pemberton's; these were 64 pages and again were undated and were priced at 1/-.

The British issues are abridged versions of US issues from both the first and second series. The titles corresponded to the titles on the US magazine from which the stories were taken, so all were titled "Super Science Stories" except for the April 1953 issue, which was titled "Super Science Novels Magazine".

Tryon Creek

Tryon Creek is a tributary of the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Part of the drainage basin of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, its watershed covers about in <a href="Multnomah%20County%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah</a> and <a href="Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clackamas</a> counties. The stream flows southeast from the <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills) through the <a href="Multnomah%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah Village</a> neighborhood of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a> and the <a href="Tryon%20Creek%20State%20Natural%20Area">Tryon Creek State Natural Area</a> to the Willamette in the city of <a href="Lake%20Oswego%2C%20Oregon">Lake Oswego</a>. Parks and open spaces cover about 21 percent of the watershed, while single-family homes dominate most of the remainder. The largest of the parks is the state natural area, which straddles the border between the two cities and counties.

The bedrock under the watershed includes part of the last exotic <a href="terrane">terrane</a>, a chain of <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s, acquired by the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> as it moved west during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> eruptions, <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the <a href="Boring%20Lava%20Field">Boring Lava Field</a> are in the Tryon Creek watershed.

Named for mid-19th century settler, <a href="Socrates%20Hotchkiss%20Tryon%2C%20Sr.">Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr.</a>, the creek ran through forests of <a href="Thuja%20plicata">cedar</a> and <a href="Douglas-fir">fir</a> that were later logged by the <a href="Oregon%20Iron%20Company">Oregon Iron Company</a> and others through the mid-20th century. Efforts to establish a large park in the watershed began in the 1950s and succeeded in 1975 when the <a href="List%20of%20Oregon%20state%20parks">state park</a> was formally established. As of 2005, about 37 percent of the watershed was wooded and supported more than 60 species of birds as well as small mammals, <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, and fish. At the same time, the human population was about 18,000.

Tryon Creek begins slightly north of <a href="Interstate%205">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) and <a href="Oregon%20Route%2099W">Oregon Route 99W</a> near <a href="Multnomah%20Village">Multnomah Village</a> and flows southeast for through Portland residential neighborhoods as well as Marshall Park and the Tryon Creek State Natural Area to its confluence with the Willamette River in the city of Lake Oswego. Not far from its source, the main stem runs through three closely spaced <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s with a combined length of then flows on the surface before entering another culvert, long under Southwest 30th Avenue at river mile (RM) 4.56 or river kilometer (RK) 7.34. Shortly thereafter, the stream passes under Route 99W (Barbur Boulevard) and I-5 through another culvert, long.

Tryon Creek receives Falling Creek from the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right</a> at from the mouth. Quail and Burlingame creeks enter from the right shortly thereafter. At Marshall Park, the stream passes through a series of rock pools and steps known as the Marshall Cascade from RM 3.48 (RK 5.60) to RM 3.28 (RK 5.28). Arnold Creek, which is Tryon Creek's largest tributary, enters from the right from the mouth. Almost immediately, the creek enters a culvert, about long, that passes under Southwest Boones Ferry Road.

Shortly thereafter, Tryon Creek enters the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. To the stream's right is the North Creek Trail. Soon the creek receives Fourth Avenue Creek from the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left</a>. At this point, the Fourth Avenue Trail runs parallel to the creek along the left bank. This <a href="trail">trail</a> soon merges with the Lewis and Clark Trail, which also runs parallel to the creek along the left bank. Then Tryon Creek passes under the High Bridge, the uppermost of five <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a>s that span the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> within the park. High Bridge carries the Middle Creek Trail as well as a linear horse trail connecting the park's North and South horse loops. Below this bridge, the creek flows for about before passing under the Beaver Bridge. In this stretch, the Middle Creek Trail parallels the stream along the right bank but crosses to the left bank at the bridge. Shortly thereafter, the creek passes under Obie's Bridge, which carries the Old Man Trail.

Since 2002, the USGS has monitored the flow of Tryon Creek at a station from the mouth. The average flow between 2002 and 2011 was . This is from a drainage area of , about 97 percent of the total Tryon Creek watershed. The maximum flow recorded during this period was on December 9, 2010. The minimum was on September 4, 5, and 12, 2002.

 One hundred and fifty million years ago, Oregon did not exist. Not until <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> separated North America from Europe and North Africa and pushed it westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. Over many millions of years, the continent collided with and incorporated islands, reefs, and other exotic <a href="terrane">terrane</a>s. Part of the last major exotic terrane acquired by the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> lies under the Tryon Creek watershed. The terrane consisted of a chain of <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s that by 34 million years ago was being uplifted to become the <a href="Oregon%20Coast%20Range">Oregon Coast Range</a> and the <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills). The easternmost exposure of the <a href="basalt">basalt</a>s of this terrane is in Waverly Heights, near <a href="Milwaukie%2C%20Oregon">Milwaukie</a>, across the Willamette River from Tryon Creek, and this formation underlies most of Tryon Creek State Park.

Between 15 and 16 million years ago, in the <a href="Middle%20Miocene">Middle Miocene</a>, eruptions of <a href="Columbia%20River%20Basalt%20Group">Columbia River basalts</a> from <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed across much of northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have been mapped in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, <a href="Hoyt%20Arboretum">Hoyt Arboretum</a>, and the steepest slopes of <a href="Forest%20Park%20%28Portland%29">Forest Park</a>, they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed.

Starting about 3 million years ago and continuing at least through the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, <a href="extensional%20fault">extensional fault</a>ing of the Earth's <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> led to eruption of small volcanoes in the <a href="Boring%20Lava%20Field">Boring volcanic field</a>. This field extended roughly from Portland and <a href="Tualatin%2C%20Oregon">Tualatin</a> on the west to <a href="Battle%20Ground%2C%20Washington">Battle Ground, Washington</a>, on the north to <a href="Sandy%2C%20Oregon">Sandy</a> and <a href="Boring%2C%20Oregon">Boring</a> on the east. Two of these volcanoes, <a href="Mount%20Sylvania">Mount Sylvania</a> and Cook's Butte, are in the Tryon Creek watershed. The Mount Sylvania eruptions included ash plumes and lava flows that covered some of the Waverly Heights Formation and Columbia River basalts.

About 15,000 years ago, cataclysmic <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> events known as the <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a> or Bretz Floods originating in the <a href="Clark%20Fork%20%28river%29">Clark Fork</a> region of northern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> inundated the Columbia River basin many times. These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment and created new <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s in the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>. Over long stretches of time between the great floods, dry winds deposited silt. At elevations above in the Tryon Creek watershed, wind-blown silt covers the lava, while at lower elevations sand and gravel cover the bedrock.

 The Tryon Creek <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> covers about or . Of this, about 80 percent is within the Portland city limits, and the remaining 20 percent is split among the jurisdictions of the city of Lake Oswego, and the counties of Multnomah and Clackamas. These four overlap with the jurisdiction of the <a href="Government%20of%20Oregon">State of Oregon</a>, which owns the natural area. Watersheds that border the Tryon Creek watershed are <a href="Fanno%20Creek">Fanno Creek</a> to the west and northwest, Stephens Creek to the north, the Willamette River to the east and <a href="Oswego%20Lake">Oswego Lake</a> to the south. More than of surface streets, including parts of Interstate 5, Oregon Route 99W, Oregon Route 43, Boones Ferry Road, Taylors Ferry Road, and Terwilliger Boulevard, run through the watershed.
About of precipitation, almost entirely rain, fall on the watershed each year. Summers are dry, and most of the precipitation occurs between October and May. Elevations within the drainage basin vary from Mount Sylvania, which rises to above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> in the West Hills, to where the creek enters the Willamette River. Between 60 and 75 percent of the slopes in the watershed exceed a 30-percent grade and are especially steep near the headwaters. <a href="Impervious%20surface">Impervious surface</a>s cover about 24 percent of the basin. These surfaces and the relatively impermeable silt and clay soils that underlie the area contribute to rapid runoff and low <a href="baseflow">baseflow</a>s in the creek and its tributaries. The total length of surface streams in the drainage basin is about , while another run through culverts or pipes. Although major flooding in 1996 caused landslides and severe damage to stream beds and banks along Tryon Creek and its tributaries, it caused no significant property damage in the watershed.

In 2000, the population of the Tryon Creek watershed within Portland was about 18,000. In 2005, Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) described land-use <a href="zoning">zoning</a> in the watershed as follows: single-family residential, 55 percent; parks and open space, 14 percent; <a href="multi-family%20residential">multi-family residential</a>, 5 percent; commercial, 3 percent, and insufficient data, 2 percent. To reach 100 percent, BES listed but did not differentiate by zoning type the roughly 20 percent of the watershed that lies beyond the Portland city limits. <a href="Metro%20%28Oregon%20regional%20government%29">Metro</a>, the regional government for the Portland metropolitan area, says that parks and natural areas cover about 21 percent of the total watershed, while single-family housing dominates most of the rest.

The major smaller streams in the Tryon Creek watershed are Arnold Creek and Falling Creek. The larger of the two, Arnold Creek, has a watershed of roughly or 18 percent of the total, while Falling Creek's watershed covers or 6 percent of the total. The seven named tributaries from mouth to source are Nettle, Palatine Hill, Red Fox, Park, Fourth Avenue, Arnold, and Falling creeks.

 <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) developed the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) in the 1970s to rate general water quality at different locations. Scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) incorporated the OWQI into its monitoring of Tryon Creek in 1997. As of 2004, the overall OWQI score for Tryon Creek was 74 or "poor"; this was slightly better than nearby Fanno Creek at 67. The State of Oregon listed Tryon Creek as "water-quality limited" in 1998 because water temperatures on the lower of the main stem as well as on Nettle, Arnold, and Falling creeks exceeded the upper limit for protecting <a href="Salmonidae">salmonid</a> fish rearing and migratory fish passage during the summer.

BES monitors water quality at three Tryon Creek sites. Two are near I-5 and Barbur Boulevard in the upper watershed, and the third is at Southwest Boones Ferry Road, about from the mouth. BES looks at several indicators such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and <a href="total%20suspended%20solids">total suspended solids</a>. Diffuse pollution from <a href="nonpoint%20source%20pollution">nonpoint sources</a> enters the creek from its urban surroundings. <a href="Point%20source%20pollution">Point sources</a> of pollution in the creek include two major upper-watershed <a href="stormwater">stormwater</a> outfalls draining of the upper watershed and contributing about half of the creek's total suspended solids. As of 2004, the only water-quality indicator in the watershed that failed to meet minimal standards was the water temperature.

In 2015, BES began issuing annual "report cards" for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city. BES assigns grades for each of four categories: hydrology, water quality, habitat, and fish and wildlife. Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and the degree to which its streams flow freely, not dammed or diverted. Water-quality grades are based on measurements of <a href="Oxygen%20saturation">dissolved oxygen</a>, "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E-coli</a>" bacteria, temperature, <a href="suspended%20solid">suspended solid</a>s, and substances such as mercury and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains, <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s, <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">tree canopies</a>, and other variables. The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds, fish, and <a href="Invertebrate">macroinvertebrate</a>s. In 2015, the BES grades for Tryon Creek are hydrology, B; water quality, B; habitat, B, and fish and wildlife, C−.

 Multnomah and Clackamas counties were named after groups of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> who lived in the area before settlement by <a href="European%20American">European American</a>s in the 19th century. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascades</a> as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, the <a href="Clackamas%20River">Clackamas River</a> basin, about upriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek and on the east side of the Willamette, was home to the <a href="Clackamas%20%28tribe%29">Clackamas</a> tribe. They were a subgroup of the <a href="Chinookan%20languages">Chinookan</a> speakers who lived near the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> from <a href="Celilo%20Falls">Celilo Falls</a> to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a> at what became <a href="Oregon%20City%2C%20Oregon">Oregon City</a> to its confluence with the Columbia River. When <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark</a> visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and <a href="measles">measles</a> reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands. Another group of Chinookans, the <a href="Multnomah%20%28tribe%29">Multnomahs</a>, lived on <a href="Sauvie%20Island">Sauvie Island</a>, about downriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek. Lewis and Clark estimated that 800 Multnomahs inhabited 5 villages on the island in 1806, but disease reduced them later in the century to near extinction.

In 1850, <a href="Socrates%20Hotchkiss%20Tryon%2C%20Sr.">Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr.</a>, a pioneer settler of European descent, established a <a href="Donation%20Land%20Claim%20Act">donation land claim</a> at the south end of Tryon Creek canyon. Five years later, he died, leaving the land to his wife, Frances. The land then passed to other relatives, including Socrates Tryon, Jr., who sold the in 1874 to the <a href="Oregon%20Iron%20Company">Oregon Iron Company</a>. For nearly 25 years, the company cut virgin <a href="Thuja%20plicata">cedar</a> and fir to use in its <a href="foundry">foundry</a> in Lake Oswego. Its logging road later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. In 1900, fire in the upper canyon left charred <a href="Snag%20%28ecology%29">snags</a> still visible along the natural area's Center and Big Fir trails.

Logging resumed in 1912 in the north part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and <a href="steam%20donkey">steam donkey</a> engine operated near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for <a href="railroad%20tie">railroad tie</a>s, <a href="cordwood">cordwood</a> and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the <a href="Columbus%20Day%20Storm%20of%201962">Columbus Day Storm</a> blew down many remaining trees.

Local efforts began in the 1950s to establish a park along the creek, In 1969, the government of Multnomah County bought to start a large regional park and sought citizen assistance with the project. This led to formation of Friends of Tryon Creek Park, which raised funds, helped arrange land deals, worked on problems of jurisdiction in a two-county, two-city park, and sought help from the state. In 1970, Oregon Governor <a href="Tom%20McCall">Tom McCall</a> announced the formation of Tryon Creek State Park.

Over the next few years, the state bought more than of land for nearly $3 million, including federal <a href="matching%20fund">matching fund</a>s. The Friends and the state collaborated in park planning and further fund-raising. In 1973, more than 300 volunteers built trails, and the nature center and shelter were finished by 1975. The park was officially dedicated on July 1, 1975 and later renamed Tryon Creek State Natural Area.

 About 37 percent of the watershed is wooded. Dominant trees are <a href="Alnus%20rubra">red alder</a>, <a href="Acer%20macrophyllum">bigleaf maple</a>, <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a>, western redcedar, and <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">western hemlock</a>. The forest understory in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area includes many <a href="trillium">trillium</a>s; they are celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90 species of wildflower such as <a href="Tellima%20grandiflora">fringecup</a> are found in the park as well as plants such as <a href="Polystichum%20munitum">sword fern</a>. Invasive species found in many parts of the watershed include <a href="Hedera%20helix">English ivy</a>, <a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Himalayan blackberry</a>, <a href="Ilex%20aquifolium">English holly</a>, <a href="Alliaria%20petiolata">garlic mustard</a>, and <a href="Clematis%20ligusticifolia">western clematis</a>.

Riparian zones and floodplains are relatively intact along the lower reaches of the main stem in the state natural area, fairly intact in Marshall Park, and marginal in the upper reaches surrounded by homes. Arnold Creek has riparian corridors wider than in good condition, while Falling Creek's riparian zones, surrounded by homes, are in poor condition. Damaged zones from which native vegetation has been removed lead to erosion, stream bank failure, sedimentation, lack of shading, and higher stream temperatures.

Tryon Creek is among the few streams in the Portland metropolitan area with a run of <a href="rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a> Trout, and <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a> have been recorded <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawning</a> in the creek.

None was present in large number. Cutthroat trout had the biggest population, estimated at 53 individual fish during the spring of 2002. <a href="Gerridae">Water striders</a>, which are invertebrates that can walk on water, are common in the pools of Tryon Creek.

 Parks in the Tryon Creek watershed include <a href="Tryon%20Creek%20State%20Natural%20Area">Tryon Creek State Natural Area</a>, Oregon's only metropolitan state park. At about , the natural area is much larger than the watershed's other parks.

The state park includes a bicycle path that runs along <a href="Terwilliger%20Boulevard">Terwilliger Boulevard</a> on the east edge of the park as part of the Portland metropolitan area's system of <a href="greenway%20%28landscape%29">greenway</a> trails known as the <a href="40-Mile%20Loop">40-Mile Loop</a>.

A park building called the Nature Center houses a gift shop, a large classroom, space for educational exhibits, and a play area for small children.

Tryon Creek, which flows through the middle of the state park, also runs through Marshall Park, a modified natural area of about in a canyon in the hills northwest of Mount Sylvania. It features hiking trails, a playground, picnic tables, a waterfall, and a stone bridge over the creek. Other parks in the watershed include West Portland Park, a natural area of about , and Maricara Park, a natural area of about .

Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)

The siege of Thessalonica between 1422 and 1430 saw the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> under <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a> capture the city of <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands for the next five centuries, until it became part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Kingdom of Greece</a> in 1912.

Thessalonica had already been under Ottoman control from 1387 to 1403 before returning to <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> rule in the aftermath of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ankara">Battle of Ankara</a>. In 1422, after the Byzantines supported <a href="Mustafa%20%C3%87elebi">Mustafa Çelebi</a> as a rival pretender against him, Murad attacked Thessalonica. Unable to provide manpower or resources for the city's defense, its ruler, <a href="Andronikos%20Palaiologos%20%28son%20of%20Manuel%20II%29">Andronikos Palaiologos</a>, handed it over to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> in September 1423. The Venetians attempted to persuade the Sultan to recognize their possession, but failed as Murad considered the city his by right and the Venetians to be interlopers. This impasse led to an Ottoman blockade of Thessalonica, which occasionally flared up with direct attacks on the city. At the same time, the conflict was mostly fought as a series of raids by both sides against the other's territories in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and the <a href="Aegean%20islands">Aegean islands</a>. The Venetians repeatedly tried to apply pressure by blocking the passage of the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> at <a href="Gelibolu">Gallipoli</a>, with little success.

The blockade quickly reduced the inhabitants to near starvation, and led many to flee the city. The restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, the violations of their customary rights, and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials led to the formation of a pro-surrender party within the city, which gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Thessalonica">metropolitan bishop</a>, <a href="Symeon%20of%20Thessalonica">Symeon</a>, encouraged his flock to resist. However, by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace on its own terms evident, a majority of the local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage that would accompany a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed: the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.

After years of inconclusive exchanges, the two sides prepared for a final confrontation in 1429. In March, Venice formally declared war on the Ottomans, but even then the conservative mercantile aristocracy running the Republic were uninterested in raising an army sufficient to protect Thessalonica, let alone to force the Sultan to seek terms. In early 1430, Murad was able to concentrate his forces against Thessalonica, taking it by storm on 29 March 1430. The privations of the siege and the subsequent <a href="looting">sack</a> reduced the city to a shadow of its former self, from perhaps as many as 40,000 inhabitants to , and necessitated large-scale resettlement in the following years. Venice concluded a peace treaty with the Sultan in July, recognizing the new status quo. Over the next few decades, the antagonism between Venice and the Ottomans morphed into a rivalry over control of <a href="Albania">Albania</a>.

In the 14th century, the nascent <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> were a <a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">rising power</a> in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>. After subduing much of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, with the <a href="Fall%20of%20Gallipoli">capture</a> of <a href="Gelibolu">Gallipoli</a> in 1354, Ottoman Turks also acquired a foothold in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. The Christian powers of the region, notably the declining <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, were weak and divided, allowing a rapid Turkish expansion across the region, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish "<a href="ghazi%20%28warrior%29">ghazi</a>" warrior-bands. In 1369 the Ottomans were able to <a href="Ottoman%20conquest%20of%20Adrianople">capture Adrianople</a>, the third-most important city of the Byzantine Empire after its capital <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>. Thessalonica, ruled by the Byzantine prince and future emperor <a href="Manuel%20II%20Palaiologos">Manuel II Palaiologos</a> (), itself surrendered in 1387 after a <a href="Siege%20of%20Thessalonica%20%281383%E2%80%931387%29">lengthy siege</a> (1383–1387), along with the cities of <a href="Kavala">Christopolis</a> and <a href="Chrysopolis%20%28Thrace%29">Chrysopolis</a>.

Initially the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the "<a href="hara%C3%A7">haraç</a>" <a href="poll-tax">poll-tax</a>. Following the death of Emperor <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a> in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan <a href="Bayezid%20I">Bayezid I</a>, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after a brief period of resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.

Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son <a href="S%C3%BCleyman%20%C3%87elebi">Süleyman</a> in the <a href="Ottoman%20Interregnum">Ottoman succession struggle</a> that broke out following the crushing defeat of the Ottomans and the capture of Bayezid at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ankara">Battle of Ankara</a> against the <a href="Turco-Mongol">Turco-Mongol</a> <a href="Timurid%20Empire">conqueror</a> <a href="Timur">Timur</a> in 1402. In exchange for his support by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gallipoli">Treaty of Gallipoli</a>, the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a> peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers <a href="Strymon%20River">Strymon</a> and <a href="Pineios%20%28Thessaly%29">Pineios</a>.

Despite the restoration of Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which according to modern scholars amounted to virtual autonomy. This was part of a wider phenomenon attested for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as central authority weakened and centrifugal tendencies manifested themselves. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency to pursue increased independence from the imperial capital had been evident at least since the <a href="Zealots%20of%20Thessalonica">Zealot movement</a> of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382–1387. Thus, after they returned to Byzantine control Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous <a href="appanage">appanage</a> to <a href="John%20VII%20Palaiologos">John VII Palaiologos</a>. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the <a href="Despot%20%28court%20title%29">Despot</a> <a href="Andronikos%20Palaiologos%20%28son%20of%20Manuel%20II%29">Andronikos Palaiologos</a>, who was supervised by <a href="Demetrios%20Leontares">Demetrios Leontares</a> until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, although it was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by <a href="Musa%20%C3%87elebi">Musa Çelebi</a>) and 1416 (during the uprising of <a href="Mustafa%20%C3%87elebi">Mustafa Çelebi</a> against <a href="Mehmed%20I">Mehmed I</a>). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city built up again. Just as during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western European ("<a href="Latins%20%28Middle%20Ages%29">Latin</a>") help, and those urging submission to the Ottomans.

The eventual victor in the Ottoman civil war, <a href="Mehmed%20I">Mehmed I</a> (), maintained good relations with the Byzantines who had supported him. The accession of <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a> () changed the situation, as <a href="John%20VIII%20Palaiologos">John VIII Palaiologos</a> (), the heir-apparent and "de facto" regent for the ailing Manuel II, set up Mustafa Çelebi as a rival to Murad. After defeating his opponent, Murad, determined to extinguish the remnants of the Byzantine state, <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281422%29">laid siege</a>, unsuccessfully, to Constantinople from 10 June to 6 September 1422. In June 1422, <a href="B%C3%BCrak%20Bey">Bürak Bey</a>, the son of <a href="Evrenos">Evrenos</a>, assisted by various Ottoman marcher-lords of the Balkans, besieged Thessalonica as well, and ravaged its suburbs and the western portion of Chalcidice.

According to the city's <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Thessalonica">metropolitan bishop</a>, <a href="Symeon%20of%20Thessalonica">Symeon</a> (in office 1416/17–1429), both he and Despot Andronikos sent repeated pleas for aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems. Eventually, a single unnamed commander was sent to the city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. This commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have borne the brunt of the cost. The common people likewise proved unwilling to contribute; when the news spread that the Ottomans had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that Despot Andronikos left the city, the commoners even rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans.

At that point a group of aristocrats persuaded the Despot to seek the assistance of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of <a href="Chalcis">Negroponte</a>, he informed the Venetians of his intention to hand over the city to them. When he informed the Venetians, they were appalled. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Orthodox Church</a> be respected, and that Venice pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. The 16th-century chronicler <a href="Pseudo-Sphrantzes">Pseudo-Sphrantzes</a> claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s, and this statement was often accepted by scholars until the mid-20th century. This is not mentioned in any other source, nor is it found in the original documents pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars <a href="Konstantinos%20Mertzios">Konstantinos Mertzios</a> and <a href="Paul%20Lemerle">Paul Lemerle</a>. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorized to provide a sum of 20,000–40,000 <a href="aspron">aspers</a> from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it.

The offer arrived in Venice at an opportune time. The election of <a href="Francesco%20Foscari">Francesco Foscari</a> on 15 April 1423 as <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge of Venice</a> had placed a proponent of a more aggressive and unyielding stance against Ottoman expansionism at the head of the Republic. But the majority of the <a href="Great%20Council%20of%20Venice">Great Council of Venice</a> was still dominated by the more cautious tendencies of the merchant nobility that ruled the Republic and they feared the disruption to trade that open war with the Ottomans would bring. Since the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>, the Venetians had consciously adopted a policy of gradually acquiring outposts, fortresses and islands from the collapsing Byzantine Empire, providing bases that secured Venice's valuable trading links with the East. For some time Venice had viewed Thessalonica as a possible expansion target, especially as Constantinople seemed to be on the verge of falling to the Turks. Thus in 1419, Venice re-established a consulate in the city, headed by a local Greek, George Philomati, and after his death in 1422 by his brother Demetrios.

At a session of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>—Negroponte, <a href="Nauplia">Nauplia</a>, <a href="Tinos">Tinos</a> and <a href="Mykonos">Mykonos</a>, and the vassal <a href="Duke%20of%20Naxos">Duke of Naxos</a>—to prepare ships to take possession of the city, while the Republic's "<a href="Bailo%20of%20Constantinople">bailo</a>" at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named "<a href="provveditori">provveditori</a>" (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if Despot Andronikos were still willing, taking over the city and arranging for its defence by hiring mercenaries. Giorgio was then to go before the Sultan, inform him of Venice's acquisition of the city and justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to the Sultan. The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between the Sultan and the Republic, and between the Sultan and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks—some 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city—but more immediately, a secure flow of supplies.

Nevertheless, large segments of the population continued to support the seeking of a settlement with the Ottomans; the writings of Metropolitan Symeon record that a number of inhabitants fled at this time to the Ottomans. This sentiment even included some members of the nobility: the contemporary Byzantine historian <a href="Doukas%20%28historian%29">Doukas</a> records that soon after taking over the city, the Venetians imprisoned four leading aristocrats, led by a certain Platyskalites, for their association with the Ottomans. The four men were exiled, first to <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, and then to Venice itself and <a href="Padua">Padua</a>. Only after the fall of Thessalonica in 1430 were the two survivors released. The contemporary Venetian "<a href="Morosini%20Codex">Morosini Codex</a>" records a story of a conspiracy—dismissed as "slanderous" by <a href="Donald%20Nicol">Donald Nicol</a>—led by Despot Andronikos to hand over the city to the Turks. The plot was reportedly discovered in November 1423, and Andronikos and his supporters were exiled, with the Despot sent to <a href="Nauplia">Nauplia</a> in the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>.

The Venetians hoped to secure Ottoman consent to the occupation of Thessalonica. However, when the "provveditore" Giorgio attempted to carry out his mission to the Sultan's court, probably in February 1424, he was unsuccessful to the point of being arrested and imprisoned by Murad. The Ottomans refused to accept the handover, considering the Venetian presence illegal on account of their previous right to the city through conquest. The Ottoman attitude was summed up by the reply allegedly given by Murad to Venetian ambassadors seeking peace, as recorded by Doukas:
When news of Giorgio's arrest arrived in Venice, the Great Council decided to replace both him and Venier. The first two choices for replacement, <a href="Jacopo%20Trevisan">Jacopo Trevisan</a> and <a href="Fantino%20Michiel">Fantino Michiel</a>, refused, but in May 1424, <a href="Bernardo%20Loredan">Bernardo Loredan</a> was named <a href="duke">duke</a> (governor) of the city, with <a href="Jacopo%20Dandolo">Jacopo Dandolo</a> as captain (military commander), for a two-year term. In the meantime, Venier was instructed to secure the release of Giorgio, and recognition from the Sultan of Venetian control over Thessalonica, the surrounding villages, and the fort of Kortiach (<a href="Mount%20Chortiatis">Mount Chortiatis</a>). In exchange, he was to offer an annual tribute of 1,000 to 2,000 ducats, and to distribute annuities to the Sultan's chief courtiers. The same instructions were given to the new captain-general of the fleet, <a href="Pietro%20Loredan">Pietro Loredan</a>, who sailed for Thessalonica. If he found the city under siege, Loredan was to attack Gallipoli—where he had scored a <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli%20%281416%29">major victory</a> in 1416—hinder the passage of Ottoman troops over the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, and if practicable, to try and stir up opposition to the Sultan among neighbouring rulers. To emphasize the fact that Venice did not desire war, Loredan was instructed to inform the local Turkish commanders that his actions were only as a consequence of the imprisonment of Giorgio and the siege of Thessalonica, which they had acquired legally.

This set the pattern for the six-year conflict between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried to put pressure on the Sultan by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman <a href="crusade">crusade</a>, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.

The Venetians had a possible and willing ally in the person of <a href="Junayd%20of%20Ayd%C4%B1n">Junayd</a>, ruler of the Turkish <a href="Aydinid">Aydinid</a> principality in central western <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. Junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broad anti-Ottoman alliance with another Turkish principality, the <a href="Karamanids">Karamanids</a> of central Anatolia, and to renew the Ottoman civil war by sending another Ottoman prince, Ismail, to <a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a> (the Ottoman-ruled part of the Balkans). In the course of this conflict, Murad allied himself with Venice's rival, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Republic of Genoa</a>, to blockade the coasts of Junayd's domain and prevent Ismail from setting sail. Junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425, depriving Venice of his assistance. In February 1424, Murad concluded a peace with the Byzantines, who returned almost all the lands they had gained in 1403 and, reduced to Constantinople and its environs, became tributary vassals to the Ottomans once more.

Efforts at a crusade, meanwhile, faltered on the persistent rivalry of Venice and the <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a>, <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a>, the protagonist of the failed anti-Ottoman <a href="Crusade%20of%20Nicopolis">Crusade of Nicopolis</a> in 1396, over possession of <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. Both Venice and Hungary attempted to exploit the momentary Ottoman weakness and the resulting turmoil in the Balkans to expand their territories—Venice in Dalmatia and <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, Sigismund in <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a>, <a href="Medieval%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>. Venice seized <a href="Zadar">Zara</a>, <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a>, and other Dalmatian cities from Hungary between 1412 and 1420. This policy brought the Republic into conflict with the <a href="Despot%20of%20Serbia">Despot of Serbia</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Lazarevi%C4%87">Stefan Lazarević</a> () between 1420 and 1423, forcing the latter to seek the aid of the Ottomans. The Emperors Manuel II and John VIII, along with the <a href="King%20of%20Poland">King of Poland</a> <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20II%20Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o">Władysław II Jagiełło</a>, tried to effect a reconciliation between Venice and Sigismund, but in vain. It was only in 1425, when Murad II, freed from threats to his Anatolian possessions, went on the counter-offensive, that Venice itself recognized the necessity of an alliance with Sigismund. Nevertheless, despite additional pressure for a rapprochement from <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Savoy</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Florence">Florence</a>, Sigismund refused. This dispute allowed the Ottomans to bring Serbia and Bosnia back into <a href="vassalage">vassalage</a>, and after Murad stopped Sigismund's advance at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Golubac">Siege of Golubac</a> in 1428, a truce was arranged between the two powers.

In the meantime, despite the activities of Loredan around Gallipoli, the situation in Thessalonica was so dire by October 1424 that the Great Council had to authorize the dispatch to the city of between 150 and 200 soldiers, as well as supplies and money. On 13 January 1425, the Venetians decided to equip 25 galleys, an unusually large and expensive undertaking, for the next year; Fantino Michiel was appointed captain-general. The fleet sailed in April, and was tasked both with settling affairs in the Venetian colonies and with reassuring the Thessalonians of Venetian support. Michiel was also instructed to make contact with the Sultan and pledge considerable sums to the <a href="Grand%20Vizier">Grand Vizier</a>, <a href="%C3%87andarl%C4%B1%20Ibrahim%20Pasha%20the%20Elder">Çandarlı Ibrahim Pasha</a>, and other members of the Ottoman court, in order to gain a sympathetic hearing. The Republic proposed to restore the <a href="salt%20evaporation%20pond">salt pans</a> that the Sultan had previously controlled, as well as the tribute of 100,000 aspers that Despot Andronikos had paid. The Venetians refused, however, to allow the Turks in the city to be tried by their own "<a href="Kad%C4%B1">kadi</a>", as had been the case under Andronikos, and insisted on the reinstatement of customs posts at the city gates. Michiel was further tasked with securing the release of Venetian citizens taken during an Ottoman raid into the <a href="Morea">Morea</a> the previous March, and re-confirming the previous <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian%20peace%20treaty%20%281419%29">peace treaty of 1419</a>, including, if possible, the restitution of the <a href="Marquisate%20of%20Bodonitsa">Marquisate of Bodonitsa</a> to its ruler, <a href="Nicholas%20III%20Zorzi">Niccolo III Zorzi</a>.

In July 1425, ten Venetian galleys under Michiel undertook an expedition east along the shores of Macedonia: the Venetians found <a href="Ierissos">Ierissos</a> abandoned by its Ottoman garrison, but full of provisions, which they loaded onto their ships. After setting fire to the town and five other forts in the vicinity, the fleet moved onto Christopolis. The Venetians found the castle held by a 400-strong force of Ottoman "<a href="sipahi">sipahi</a>s," under the command of Ismail Bey. The first attempt to land, led by <a href="Alvise%20Loredan">Alvise Loredan</a>, was repulsed, and only after all the ships mustered their forces were the Venetians able to overcome Ottoman resistance in a four-hour-long battle: 41 Turks were killed, including Ismail Bey, and 30 taken prisoner. After strengthening the site with a stone wall and earthworks, and leaving a garrison of 80 foot soldiers and 50 crossbowmen to hold it, the fleet departed. The Turks soon returned with a larger force of 10,000–12,000 men, and after about twenty days, and despite losing around 800 men, the Ottomans stormed the castle. Unable to escape, half the Venetians were killed and the rest taken prisoner.

On 21 July Manuel II died, and John VIII formally became Emperor. In response Murad, who was deeply hostile towards John, launched his forces on raids around Thessalonica and Zetouni (<a href="Lamia%20%28city%29">Lamia</a>) in <a href="Central%20Greece">Central Greece</a>. At the same time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to complain of violations of their rights by the duke and captain. Among other things, they insisted that the Venetians fortify <a href="Cassandreia">Kassandreia</a> on the western Chalcidice, to protect the <a href="Kassandra%20Peninsula">Kassandra Peninsula</a> from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He then captured the <a href="Platamon%20Castle">Platamon Castle</a>, on the opposite side of the <a href="Thermaic%20Gulf">Thermaic Gulf</a>, by storm, after setting fire to its main <a href="Ward%20%28castle%29">bailey</a> when the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, for it is not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from <a href="Padua">Padua</a> to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorized the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, it appears that Michiel was simultaneously engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Turahan%20Bey">Turahan Bey</a>, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the "Codex Morosini", a <a href="Pseudo-Mustafa">pretender claiming to be Mustafa Çelebi</a> arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these actions, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut.

In April 1426, Michiel came near to a settlement with the Ottoman governor at Gallipoli, whereby the Republic would keep Thessalonica in exchange for 100,000 aspers a year, the right of disputes between Turks in the city to be settled by their own "kadi", and free and untaxed movement of merchants to and from the city. The negotiations foundered again, however, as the Ottomans insisted on their control of Kassandra and Chortiatis, which they intended as springboards for the eventual conquest of the city. At the same time, the Ottomans launched a mayor attack on the city with reportedly 30,000 men, but the presence of five Venetian galleys in the city, possibly armed with small cannons, helped the defenders repel the attack. According to the report of Loredan and Dandolo to the Great Council, 700 crossbowmen manned the walls, and over 2,000 Turks were killed before the assault failed.

On 6 May, a new duke and captain for the city were elected: Paolo Trevisan and Paolo Orio. In July 1426, the new Venetian captain-general, <a href="Andrea%20Mocenigo%20%28admiral%29">Andrea Mocenigo</a>, was instructed to resume negotiations, but concede to the Ottomans possession of Kassandra and Chortiatis. On the other hand, the peace settlement should be comprehensive, including the Latin lords of the Aegean, who were Venetian citizens and clients. Failing that, Mocenigo was to attack Gallipoli. In August, the Despot of Serbia, Stefan Lazarević, offered his services as mediator. On 28 November, Mocenigo managed to receive Murad's agreement to a peace treaty on the broad lines of the agreement proposed by Michiel, except that Venice would pay an annual tribute of 150,000 aspers and increased annuities for senior members of the Ottoman court, and would surrender Chortiatis. Despite the Republic's desire to conclude a peace treaty, the months and years dragged on without an agreement. Benedetto Emo, appointed ambassador to the Sultan in July 1427 with the express purpose of ratifying the treaty, was replaced in August 1428 by Jacopo Dandolo. Dandolo was instructed, if necessary, to offer a further increase of the tribute to 300,000 aspers, and a total sum of gifts from 10,000–15,000 ducats and a further 2,000 ducats as annuities; further sums could be offered in exchange for possession of the environs of Thessalonica, Kassandra, and the salt works. Dandolo did not have any more success than his predecessor: the Sultan demanded of him the surrender of Thessalonica, and when Dandolo replied that he did not have authority to do this, the Sultan had him thrown in prison, where he was left to die.

Throughout the confrontation over Thessalonica, the Ottomans launched constant raids against Venetian possessions in Albania. In early spring 1428, the Ottoman fleet launched a major raid against Venetian possessions in Greece: 40 to 65 vessels raided the island of <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> and took about 700 Venetian citizens prisoner, before going on to raid the environs of the two Venetian outposts of <a href="Methoni%2C%20Messenia">Modon</a> and <a href="Koroni">Coron</a> in the southwestern Morea. When news arrived in Venice on 22 April, even though the previous year's guard fleet under <a href="Guido%20da%20Canal">Guido da Canal</a> was still abroad, a guard fleet of 15 galleys was authorized to hunt the Ottoman raiders, under Andrea Mocenigo. In the event, the new fleet did not sail until September, after Canal's fleet was defeated at Gallipoli by a coalition of Ottoman and Christian ships. The Ottoman naval threat became particularly acute at this time due to the defection of the Duke of Naxos, <a href="Giovanni%20II%20Crispo">Giovanni II Crispo</a> (). Although a Venetian citizen and vassal of the Republic, mounting Ottoman pressure on his possessions had forced the Great Council to authorize him to enter into a separate peace treaty with the Ottomans, which Crispo duly did. As a result, Crispo was forced to effectively assist the Turks in their own raids, and ceased signalling the Venetians in Euboea of impending Ottoman raids via beacons. In early March 1429, an Ottoman fleet even appeared before Thessalonica, and captured two Venetian vessels.

According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice spent on average 60,000 ducats per year in this seemingly fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, while at the same time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a <a href="Wars%20in%20Lombardy">conflict</a> with the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Duchy of Milan</a> over control of <a href="northern%20Italy">northern Italy</a>. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at <a href="Chios">Chios</a> and <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made clear to the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.

On 11 May, the pretender Mustafa appeared before the Great Council, and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services. On 4 June a new duke and captain were elected for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the first three pairs chosen all declined the post, despite the fine attached to refusal; a clear indication of the unwillingness of the Venetian nobles to undertake this unprofitable and perilous task. On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship to break through the <a href="palisade">palisade</a> protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even at this point, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements.

Aware of their own weakness, the Venetians tried to form alliances with other regional rulers who feared Ottoman expansionism. Taking advantage of the Ottomans' preoccupation with the Siege of Golubac, <a href="Ibrahim%20II%20of%20Karaman">Ibrahim II of Karaman</a> () had managed to gain control of the area of <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Hamid">Hamid</a>, and in August 1429, through the mediation of King <a href="Janus%20of%20Cyprus">Janus of Cyprus</a> (), the Venetians approached Ibrahim for an alliance against Murad. Rather than resulting in a military alliance, however, the prospect of a Venetian-Cypriot-Karamanid league served to bring the Ottomans closer with the other great Muslim power of the Eastern Mediterranean, the <a href="Mamluks%20of%20Egypt">Mamluks of Egypt</a>, and initiate a period where the two states made common cause against Latin presence in the area. The Venetians also tried to influence Murad towards a peace with the threat posed by the ambitions of Timur's son <a href="Shahrukh%20Mirza">Shahrukh</a>, especially after the latter's defeat of the <a href="Kara%20Koyunlu">Kara Koyunlu</a> in September 1429 brought him within striking distance of the Ottomans' Anatolian domains: contemporary rumour ascribed to him not only a desire to restore his father's dominance over the region, but to cross the Ottoman territories into Rumelia, and return to <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> via the northern shore of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. In the event, Shahrukh retired to winter in Azerbaijan, whereupon Murad ordered his general <a href="Hamza%20Bey">Hamza Bey</a> to lead his forces from Anatolia to Europe in February 1430, and sent him against Thessalonica.

Inside Thessalonica, the siege led to much suffering, and the populace quickly became dissatisfied with their new masters. By the winter of 1426–1427, conditions in the besieged city approached the point of famine. The Thessalonians were forced to subsist on bread alone, and even that proved problematic—the authorities were forced to request more shipments of wheat from Venice when supplies ran dangerously low. The conditions of "extreme poverty, death, and destitution" made the Greek population more and more restless, and even those who had formerly welcomed the Venetians began to waver. The lack of food even jeopardized the city's defences, since many of the mercenary guards on the walls, paid by Venice with wheat instead of cash, defected to the Turks when their rations were late. This situation became progressively worse, and by the time of the final Ottoman attack in 1430, many soldiers had no weapons because they had sold them for food.

The privations of the siege led to an exodus of the city's population, as citizens with the ability to leave sold their possessions and fled to Constantinople, other Venetian-controlled Greek territories, or to the Turks. From a population variously reported at between 20,000–25,000, or even as many as 40,000, by contemporary Italian sources, it is estimated that only 10,000–13,000 were left by 1429/30. The Venetian authorities tried to put a stop to this by prohibiting the inhabitants from leaving the city, outlawing "all sales, mortgages, and transfers of property, both movable and immovable", and destroying the houses and other property—even trees—of people who had left the city. They hoped that the destruction would serve a deterrent to those who remained behind. Coupled with several instances of arbitrariness, speculation, and profiteering on behalf of the Venetian authorities, these measures helped to further alienate the Thessalonians. By April 1425, a Byzantine church official who had had his family flee the city wrote of the "enslavement of the city by the Venetians", and similar sentiments about Venetian tyranny are echoed in all contemporary Byzantine sources. In their embassy in July 1425, the Thessalonians submitted a list of 21 complaints and demands, including fixed rations of corn for the poor and the lowering of tax dues and suspension of arrears and debt-related punishments for the duration of the siege, since the closing of the gates meant that people could no longer access their fields, which were furthermore devastated by the Turks. In a session on 23 July 1425, the Great Council acceded to many of their demands and requested that its officials respect the customs and rights of the citizens and work together with the local council of twelve nobles in the governance of the city.

Whatever the Venetian efforts to secure peace, the Thessalonians were well aware, in the words of the Byzantinist <a href="Donald%20Nicol">Donald Nicol</a>, that Murad "was playing for time" and he "was never going to be reconciled to the Venetian occupation of the Thessalonica". As the historian <a href="Apostolos%20Vacalopoulos">Apostolos Vacalopoulos</a> put it, the prevailing view quickly became that "since Thessalonica was bound sooner or later to fall into Turkish hands, it would be preferable to surrender peacefully there and then, and so avoid the sufferings which would ensue if the Turks had to take the city by force." As conditions inside the city worsened, the pro-surrender current gained ground among the Thessalonians. This is evidenced from the writings of Metropolitan Symeon, who recounts that during one attack in 1425 or 1426, many citizens (including some of those guarding the walls) fled to the Ottomans. Symeon played an important role as a spokesman and leader of the city's populace during the siege. An ardently <a href="Hesychast">Hesychast</a> and anti-Latin prelate who had opposed the handover of the city to the Roman Catholic Venetians, fearing their "corrupting" influence, the Metropolitan tried to strengthen his flock's Orthodox identity against both the Latin Venetians and the Muslim Turks, as well as awaken their will to resist. He organized litanies that paraded the city's icon of the <a href="Hodegetria">Hodegetria</a>, and delivered sermons about the city's successful delivery from previous sieges through the intervention of her patron, <a href="Demetrius%20of%20Thessalonica">Demetrius of Thessalonica</a>. As a result, he emerged as the leading proponent of resistance, and despite his anti-Latin animus, the Venetians considered him "a most loyal servant of the Republic". His death in September 1429 contributed to the increasing demoralisation of the city's populace, who considered it an omen of the city's fall.

In summer 1429, the Thessalonians sent a second embassy to Venice to complain about the restrictions placed on entry and exit from the city, continued violations of their rights, extortion by the Venetian authorities, the poor supply situation, the neglect of repairing the city's fortifications and the lack of military stores, and the Venetian mercenaries who were in contact with the Turks outside the walls. On 14 July, the Great Council gave mostly reassuring answers to a list of 31 demands, but the increasing dissatisfaction by the Greek population with Venetian rule was evident. The eyewitness <a href="John%20Anagnostes">John Anagnostes</a> reports that by the winter of 1429, the majority of the population had come to favour a surrender to the Turks. Sultan Murad was aware of the situation inside the walls, and twice sent Christian officers in his service into the city to incite a rebellion against the Venetians. However, as Anagnostes writes, the population was by that time so reduced in number, and divided among itself, that no common cause could be made. Furthermore, the Thessalonians were afraid of the Venetians, as they had recruited a special force of guards, the "Tzetarioi," and given them the authority to kill anyone advocating a surrender.

A squadron of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived to reinforce the city on 17 March 1430, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only a half or a third of the <a href="crenelle">crenelle</a>s, and they were deficient in both armament and morale. News of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.

The Sultan appeared before the city on Sunday, 26 March, shortly after noon. Probably informed of the discontent inside the walls by Greek defectors, the Sultan appears to have expected the mere appearance of his army to force the city to surrender, or to signal an uprising of the populace against the Venetian garrison. In this vein he sent Christian officers to the walls, to call upon the inhabitants to surrender, but they were driven off by arrows from the walls before they had chance to complete their speeches. The Sultan then began preparations to take the city by storm, which lasted for three days. On the 28th, Murad sent another offer of surrender, but this too was rejected. On the same night, a subaltern officer entered the city to inform the Venetian commanders that the Turks had prepared six ships at the <a href="Vardar%20River">Vardar River</a> for use against the Venetian galleys in the harbour, which had been left defenceless since all available forces were concentrated in manning the city wall. Fearing that their retreat would be cut off, the Venetian commanders ordered Diedo and his men to withdraw from the wall to man the ships and the harbour defences. They did not, however, notify the population, and around midnight, Christians from the Ottoman camp approached the walls and announced that the final assault would take place the next day, from land and sea. The news spread throughout the city and panicked the populace, who spent the night in terrified vigil in the churches. The panic spread further when Diedo's withdrawal to the harbour became known. In the absence of other information, the Thessalonians believed that the Venetians were preparing to abandon them and flee. As a result, a number of defenders simply abandoned their positions on the walls and returned to their homes.

At dawn on 29 March 1430, the Ottomans launched their attack under the command of <a href="Sinan%20Pasha%20%28beylerbey%29">Sinan Pasha</a>, the "<a href="beylerbey">beylerbey</a>" (military governor) of Rumelia. The main weight of the attack fell on the less well maintained eastern section of the walls, between the Trigonion and the site of the later <a href="Heptapyrgion%20%28Thessaloniki%29">Heptapyrgion</a> fortress, where the Sultan himself led the attack. The Ottomans brought siege engines, ladders, and planks forward, and used them to undermine the walls. Ottoman archery proved crucial, for their shots were able to pin down the defenders and hit many who tried to peer over the battlements. As a result, much of the defenders' return fire was blind, and they began slowly abandoning their positions. Finally, at the <a href="Italian%20time">fourth hour</a>, the Ottoman troops broke through at multiple points along the wall; according to Anagnostes, the first Ottomans climbed the wall in the eastern section, which had been left almost defenceless. As the civilian population was being massacred, the Venetians fled to the harbour as best as they could—"one in his mantle, the other in his undershirt" in the words of the report to the Great Council. Many managed to escape to Diedo's ships, and thence to Negroponte. Others were less fortunate: the Venetians lost over 270 men from the galley crews alone. A number of senior officials, including the son of duke Paolo Contarini, and Leonardo Gradenigo, captain of one of the galleys, also fell. Details on the siege were provided by a letter sent by the Venetians of Negroponte to Venice on 2 April, after the refugees from the fall of the city arrived there, and the eyewitness account of John Anagnostes. On their return to Venice, the two Venetian commanders of Thessalonica faced charges of negligence and were imprisoned; they were most likely acquitted, however, for by 1432 both were once again active in the Republic's politics.
Following long-standing custom for a city taken by storm, the plundering lasted for three days. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, <a href="%C4%90ura%C4%91%20Brankovi%C4%87">Đurađ Branković</a>. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in the sack, particularly the cathedral of <a href="Hagios%20Demetrios">Hagios Demetrios</a>, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Acheiropoietos">Church of the Acheiropoietos</a>, which became the city's first <a href="mosque">mosque</a>. The Sultan then restored order, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. Only 2,000 of the population were left after the sack, many of whom converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from the sack himself. In addition, he brought in Muslim and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number of empty houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques. The Turks settled mostly in the <a href="Upper%20Town%20%28Thessaloniki%29">upper part</a> of the city, from where they could better control it.

The Venetians were taken by surprise when the city fell; the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Republic was by now ready to disengage itself from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby Venice recognized its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged Ottoman overlordship over <a href="Patras">Patras</a> in the Morea, with an annual tribute of 236 ducats. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durazzo</a>, <a href="Shkodra">Scutari</a>, and <a href="Antivari">Antivari</a>.

Following the capture of Thessalonica, the Ottomans went on to extend their rule over western Greece. A few months after the fall of the city <a href="Ioannina">Ioannina</a> surrendered to Hamza Bey and <a href="Carlo%20II%20Tocco">Carlo II Tocco</a> accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the southern remnant of the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a> around <a href="Arta%2C%20Greece">Arta</a>. Venice moved to place Tocco's <a href="County%20palatine%20of%20Cephalonia%20and%20Zakynthos">island possessions</a> of <a href="Zante">Zante</a>, <a href="Cephalonia">Cephalonia</a>, and <a href="Leucas">Leucas</a> under her protection. As a result, for the next half-century, until the end of the <a href="First%20Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian%20War">First Ottoman–Venetian War</a> in 1479, the main arena of confrontation between Venice and the Ottomans was to be Albania, an area of vital importance to both powers, as from there the Ottomans could threaten Italy herself.

Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until October 1912, when it was captured by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Kingdom of Greece</a> during the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>. Its remaining Muslim population left the city during the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20population%20exchange">Greco-Turkish population exchange</a> in 1923.

Ba Cụt

Lê Quang Vinh (1923 – 13 July 1956), popularly known as Ba Cụt () was a military commander of the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious sect, which operated from the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> and controlled various parts of southern <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> during the 1940s and early 1950s.

Ba Cụt and his forces fought the <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> (VNA), the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Minh">Việt Minh</a>, and the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> religious movement from 1943 until his capture in 1956. Known for his idiosyncrasies, he was regarded as an erratic and cruel leader who fought with little ideological purpose. His sobriquet came from the self-amputation of his left index finger (although it was erroneously reported that it was his middle or "third cut finger"). He later swore not to cut his hair until the communist Việt Minh were defeated. Ba Cụt frequently made alliances with various Vietnamese factions and the French. He invariably accepted the material support offered in return for his cooperation, and then broke the agreement—nevertheless, the French made deals with him on five occasions. The French position was weak because their military forces had been depleted by World War II, and they had great difficulty in re-establishing control over <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>, which had been left with a power vacuum after the defeat of Japan.

In mid-1955, the tide turned against the various sects, as Prime Minister <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> of the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a> and his VNA began to consolidate their grip on the south. Ba Cụt and his allies were driven into the jungle, and their position was threatened by government offensives. After almost a year of fighting, Ba Cụt was captured. He was sentenced to death and publicly beheaded in <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Th%C6%A1">Cần Thơ</a>.

Ba Cụt was born circa 1923 in <a href="Long%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Long Xuyên</a>, a regional town in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned at an early age and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's <a href="rice%20paddy">rice paddies</a> were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%C6%A1">Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ</a>. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and played a key role in Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, his father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.

Vietnam was a tumultuous place during Ba Cụt's youth, particularly in the Mekong Delta. In 1939, <a href="Hu%E1%BB%B3nh%20Ph%C3%BA%20S%E1%BB%95">Huỳnh Phú Sổ</a> founded the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious movement, and within a year had gained more than 100,000 followers. He drew adherents for two reasons: the prophecies he made about the outbreak of World War II and the conquest of South-East Asia by Japan, which proved to be correct; and his work as a mystical healer—his patients claimed to have been miraculously cured from all manner of serious illnesses after seeing him, when Western medicine had failed. Sổ's cult-like appeal greatly alarmed the French colonial authorities. During World War II, <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> invaded and <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">seized control of Vietnam</a> from France; its defeat and withdrawal at the end of the war in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country.

The Hòa Hảo formed their own army and administration during the war, and started a "de facto" state in their Mekong Delta stronghold. They came into conflict with the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a>, another new religious movement, which also boasted a private army and controlled a nearby region of southern Vietnam around <a href="T%C3%A2y%20Ninh">Tây Ninh</a>. Meanwhile, in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, the <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Bình Xuyên</a> <a href="organised%20crime">organised crime</a> syndicate ruled much of the city through its gangster militia. These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists: the French, who were attempting to re-establish colonial control across the entire nation; and the communist-dominated <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Minh">Việt Minh</a>, who sought Vietnamese independence.

At the time, the many groups vying for power—including their respective factions—engaged in alliances of convenience that were frequently broken. Historian <a href="David%20Elliott%20%28historian%29">David Elliott</a> wrote: ""[T]he most important eventual cause of the French decline was the inherently unstable nature of the political alliances they had devised ... [T]he history of the French relations with the Hoa Hao sect is a telling illustration of the pitfalls of short-term political deals between forces whose long-term interests conflict.""

The Hòa Hảo initially engaged in large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 the two groups had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the "Dân Xã" ("Social Democratic Party"). Because of his charisma, the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.

Ba Cụt joined the Hòa Hảo militia when it was formed in 1943–44, and became a commander within a year. He was feared by his enemies, and was described as ""a sort of lean <a href="Rasputin">Rasputin</a>"" who claimed to be immortal. According to historian and writer <a href="Bernard%20B.%20Fall">Bernard Fall</a>, ""The hapless farmers who were under the rule of the maniacal Ba Cut fared worse [than those under other military leaders], for the latter [Ba Cụt] was given to fits of incredible cruelty and had no sense of public duty."" American journalist <a href="Joseph%20Alsop">Joseph Alsop</a> described Ba Cụt as "war-drunk". Ba Cụt was famous for inventing a torture contraption that drilled a steel nail through the victim's ear, a device he used to extort villagers and wealthy landlords to fund his forces. He was said to have ""arranged temporary marriages between his troops and village girls"". He raised a large amount of funds for the Hòa Hảo and himself personally by charging traders and landlords high prices to stop pirates in the local area. The severed heads of the pirates were subsequently impaled on stakes and put on public display.

In 1947, he led his own faction of the sect after its various military leaders pursued their own policies towards the French and <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Hồ Chí Minh</a>'s <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Minh">Việt Minh</a> in the wake of Sổ's death. At the time, France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re-establish control over its colonies. Ba Cụt had only 1,000 men in five battalions at the time, fewer than 5% of Hòa Hảo forces, whereas Trần Văn Soái had 15,000 men. The French tried to maintain their hold with a divide and conquer strategy towards the Hòa Hảo. They coaxed Soái into joining with them and recognised him as the leader of the Hòa Hảo. In 1948, Ba Cụt rallied to the French and Soái, but broke away again soon after, relocating to <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng%20Th%C3%A1p%20Province">Đồng Tháp Province</a> and resuming his military activities against the French.

In 1950, Ba Cụt was involved in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Gi%C3%A1c%20Ng%E1%BB%99">Nguyễn Giác Ngộ</a>. He was defeated and driven from the district of <a href="Ch%E1%BB%A3%20M%E1%BB%9Bi%20District%2C%20An%20Giang">Chợ Mới</a> in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to <a href="Th%E1%BB%91t%20N%E1%BB%91t">Thốt Nốt</a> and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.

The most notable instance of Ba Cụt's abandoning the fight against the Việt Minh came in mid-1953. At that time, his forces had been helping to defend the regional Mekong Delta town of <a href="M%E1%BB%B9%20Tho">Mỹ Tho</a>, but the French decided to transfer more of the military power to their more mainstream allies, the <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> (VNA). As the French tried to undermine his position, tensions with Ba Cụt increased. On 25 June, the Hòa Hảo leader ordered his men to evacuate their French-supplied bases; they took their weapons with them and razed the camps. Ba Cụt then withdrew his forces from a string of military posts in the <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng%20Th%C3%A1p%20M%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Di">Plain of Reeds</a> and retreated to <a href="Ch%C3%A2u%20%C4%90%E1%BB%91c">Châu Đốc</a> in the extreme south of the country. As a result, the French-aligned presence in the Mekong Delta was severely dented and the Việt Minh made substantial gains in the area. Eventually, the French defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Điện Biên Phủ</a> in May 1954 signaled the end of <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>.

When the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Conference</a> in July 1954 ended the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>, it handed <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> to Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh, and the south to the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>. To reunify the country, national elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>. The <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partition of Vietnam</a> angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>'s State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and that half of the country should not have been yielded to the communists.

In mid-1954, General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Hinh">Nguyễn Văn Hinh</a>, the head of the State of Vietnam's VNA, announced that he did not respect the leadership of Prime Minister Diệm, and vowed to overthrow him. The "coup" never materialised and Hinh was forced into exile, but not before appointing Ba Cụt to the rank of colonel in the VNA in an attempt to undermine Diệm, as the Hòa Hảo warlord was openly contemptuous of the prime minister. In August, Ba Cụt and his 3,000 men broke from the VNA and left their Thốt Nốt base for the jungle, and fought against those who had briefly been their comrades; this put him at odds with most Hòa Hảo leaders, who accepted government payments to integrate their forces into the VNA. Operation Ecaille, the initial military offensive by the VNA against Ba Cụt was a failure, possibly because the details of the planned attack on his forces were leaked to him by Soái, a Hòa Hảo member of the National Defence Committee.

During the transition period between the signing of the Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections, South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài, and Bình Xuyên militias. In early 1955, during a battle with the Cao Đài forces of <a href="Tr%C3%ACnh%20Minh%20Th%E1%BA%BF">Trình Minh Thế</a>, after a dispute over control of the That Son region, Ba Cụt was wounded in a disputed incident. Thế claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba Cụt, but received no reply, so he decided to try to capture his rival. He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba Cụt's forces and try to capture the Hòa Hảo leader. When they located Ba Cụt and surrounded him, he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out. Ba Cụt was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest. It seemed that he would die, but a <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital. He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped. Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions, but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba Cụt's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner, and that the injuries were minor. Yet another account holds that the reaction by Thế's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt. According to this theory, Thế, whose units were then being integrated into Diệm's VNA, had given orders to target Ba Cụt. This was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, who was trying to help secure Diệm in power at the time. Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba Cụt to cease his activities.

By this time, with France preparing to withdraw from Indochina, senior French officers had begun to undermine Diệm's leadership and his attempts to stabilise South Vietnam. The VNA later implicated the French in the organisation of weapons air drops to Ba Cụt, prompting a protest from Diệm's government. Diệm complained to a French general, alleging that Ba Cụt's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to the VNA. The Hòa Hảo accused Diệm of treachery in his negotiations with various groups. They charged the prime minister with integrating Thế's forces into the VNA in return for them being allowed to attack Ba Cụt with the aid of the VNA, and that this part of the deal had been kept secret. They warned that other Hòa Hảo leaders who had stopped fighting could join Ba Cụt, and appealed to Diệm's U.S. sponsors. In response, Ba Cụt ambushed a VNA unit in Long Mỹ, killing three officers and injuring some thirty men.

In 1955, Diệm tried to integrate the remaining Hòa Hảo armies into the VNA. Ba Cụt was one of four Hòa Hảo military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April, and continued to operate autonomously. At one stage, the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo and Bình Xuyên formed an alliance called the United Front, in an attempt to pressure Diệm into handing over power; Ba Cụt was named senior military commander. However, this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other, and the United Front was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action, and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Diệm. The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings. Initially, American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Diệm would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leaders—including Ba Cụt—to hold government positions. However, Diệm refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba Cụt in Thốt Nốt on 12 March, shelling the area heavily. The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation. Diệm then attacked the Bình Xuyên's Saigon headquarters in late April, quickly crushing them.

During the fighting, the Hòa Hảo attempted to help the Bình Xuyên by attacking towns and government forces in their Mekong Delta heartland. Ba Cụt's men, who had also been angered by the recent arrest of some colleagues, blockaded the <a href="Mekong">Mekong</a> and <a href="Bassac%20River">Bassac</a> rivers and laid siege to various towns, including <a href="Sa%20%C4%90%C3%A9c">Sa Đéc</a>, <a href="Long%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Long Xuyên</a> and <a href="Ch%C3%A2u%20%C4%90%E1%BB%91c">Châu Đốc</a>, stifling the regional economy. The Hòa Hảo shut down several important regional roads and stopped the flow of agricultural produce from the nation's most fertile region into the capital, causing food prices to rise by 50%, as meat and vegetables became scarce. Ba Cụt then attacked a battalion of VNA troops south of Sa Đéc. Soon after, they retreated to a Hòa Hảo citadel on the banks of the Bassac. After reinforcing their base, the Hòa Hảo proceeded to fire mortars across the water into the city of <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Th%C6%A1">Cần Thơ</a>, which stood on the opposite side of the river. During this period, the United Front publicly accused Diệm of trying to bribe Ba Cụt with 100 million piasters, to which the Hòa Hảo responded with a series of attack on outposts and blasts to destroy bridges.

With the Bình Xuyên vanquished, Diệm turned his attention to conquering the Hòa Hảo. As a result, a battle between government troops led by General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a> and Ba Cụt's men commenced in Cần Thơ on 5 June. Five Hòa Hảo battalions surrendered immediately; Ba Cụt and three remaining leaders had fled to the <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>n border by the end of the month. Having surrendered his forces, Ngo excoriated Soai and Ba Cụt, claiming that their activities were not consistent with Hòa Hảo religious practices and accused them of fighting with communists. The soldiers of the three other leaders eventually surrendered, but Ba Cụt's men continued to the end, claiming loyalty to the Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>. Diệm responded by replacing the officers of Bảo Đại's personal regiments with his own men and used the royal units to attack Ba Cụt's rebels near <a href="H%C3%A0%20Ti%C3%AAn">Hà Tiên</a> and <a href="R%E1%BA%A1ch%20Gi%C3%A1">Rạch Giá</a>, outnumbering the Hòa Hảo by at least a factor of five. Knowing that they could not defeat the government in open conventional warfare, Ba Cụt's forces destroyed their own bases so that the VNA could not use their abandoned resources, and retreated into the jungle. Ba Cụt's 3,000 men spent the rest of 1955 evading 20,000 VNA troops who had been deployed to quell them, notwithstanding a A bounty of one million <a href="French%20Indochinese%20piastre">piaster</a>s was put on the head of Ba Cụt, who scattered trails of money in the jungle, hoping to distract his pursuers, but to no avail. The communists claimed in a history written decades later that Ba Cụt had tried to forge an alliance with them, but that talks broke down a few months later.

Despite his weak military situation, Ba Cụt sought to disrupt the staging of a <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam%20referendum%2C%201955">fraudulent referendum</a> that Diệm had scheduled to depose <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a> as head of state. Ba Cụt distributed a pamphlet condemning Diệm as an American puppet, asserting that the prime minister was going to "Catholicize" the country; the referendum was partly funded by the U.S. government and various Roman Catholic organisations. Diệm had strong support from American Roman Catholic politicians and the powerful Cardinal <a href="Francis%20Spellman">Francis Spellman</a> and his elder brother, <a href="Pierre%20Martin%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục</a>, was Archbishop of Huế. Ba Cụt presciently noted that the referendum was a means ""for Diem to gather the people from all towns and force them to demonstrate one goal: to depose Bao Dai and proclaim the puppet Diem as the chief-of-state of Vietnam."" On the day of the poll, Ba Cụt's men prevented voting in the border regions which they controlled, and ventured out of the jungles to attack polling stations in Cần Thơ. Despite that disruption, Diệm was fraudulently credited with more than 90% of support in Hòa Hảo-controlled territory, and a near unanimous turnout was recorded in the area. These results were replicated across the nation, and Diệm deposed Bảo Đại.

Eventually, Ba Cụt was surrounded, and sought to make a peace deal with the Diệm government to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba Cụt sent a message to <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%C6%A1">Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ</a>, the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle. Contemporary political commentators based in France and Vietnam saw his capture as the death knell for domestic military opposition to President Diệm, while US Embassy official Daniel Anderson speculated that defeat of "the most able and spectacular leader" of the sects would lead to a collapse in non-communist armed opposition.

Initially, American commentators and observers thought that Diệm might try a reconciliatory approach and integrate Ba Cụt into the mainstream to increase the appeal of his government, rather than punish the Hòa Hảo leader. They felt that Ba Cụt had a high level of military skill and popular appeal that could be used in favour of the government, citing his colourful "<a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>" image as an attraction with the rural populace. US officials were also worried that a harsh punishment such as the death penalty could provoke an anti-government backlash, and that it could be exploited by other opposition groups. However, Diệm saw Ba Cụt as contrary to Vietnamese values of struggle and self-sacrifice and felt that strong measures were required.

Diệm's government put Ba Cụt on trial for treason, under Article 146 of the Military Code of the Republic of Vietnam. Diệm spoke out and accused Ba Cụt of rallying to and defecting from the central government four times from 1945 to 1954, and that at his peak in mid-1954, Ba Cụt commanded 3500 troops armed with 3200 firearms. Ba Cụt was also accused of collaborating with the communists. The government submitted that the charge of treason was established by a series of attacks on VNA personnel, officers and vehicles from July 1954 until Ba Cụt's capture. The government prosecutor sought the death penalty and tendered petitions signed by residents of the Mekong Delta and southwestern Vietnam calling for the military destruction of Ba Cụt's militants. However, according to the historian Jessica Chapman, these petitions were organised by the government and heavily publicised in the Diêm-controlled media, and not representative of public opinion.

During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically removed his shirt so that the public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. However, the Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt was found guilty of arson and multiple murders and sentenced to death on 11 June. An appeal was dismissed on 27 June. On 4 July, Ba Cụt was also found guilty in a military court and sentenced to death "with degradation and confiscation of his property". It was then fell to Diệm to consider a plea for clemency. Diệm rejected this and ordered the Justice Minister to put in place the orders for execution. On the very same day, a Hòa Hảo lawyer lodged an appeal against all of the verdicts to the Supreme Appeals Court in Saigon, but the submissions were rejected in a matter of hours.

The Hòa Hảo reacted strongly to the legal verdicts as "shameful and unjust". The Dân Xã issued a statement describing the verdict and death penalty as being motivated by spite and being unsupported by evidence. Ba Cụt's defence counsel said the trial set a bad precedent for South Vietnam's fledgling legal system and questioned the integrity of the process. He claimed that VNA troops had engaged in mass rape and plunder of local civilians in their final push against Ba Cụt, and accused the Diệm regime of double standards in not investigating and prosecuting these alleged incidents. He claimed that South Vietnam had "no democracy and no freedom" and "only shamelessness and foolishness" and said that members of the Hòa Hảo would continue to resist the Saigon administration politically and militarily.

In addition, Diệm's adviser, Colonel <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a> from the <a href="CIA">CIA</a>, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt, who was compared to a character from the <a href="Wild%20West">Wild West</a>.

Ba Cụt was publicly <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>d at 5:40 am on 13 July 1956, in a cemetery in <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Th%C6%A1">Cần Thơ</a>. A crowd numbering in the hundreds, including members of Diệm's National Assembly, Minh, regional officials and both domestic and overseas journalists witnessed the beheading. Anderson believed the use of the guillotine, instead of a firing squad, as was normal for military executions, was used to emphasise that Ba Cụt's actions were being portrayed as common crimes rather than as political opposition. Chapman said that the dual military and civilian trial indicated that Diệm viewed any opposition activities as not only politically unacceptable but also as crimes related to bad character.

Ba Cụt's body was later diced into small pieces, which were then buried separately. Some followers, led by a hardcore deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Việt Cộng</a>—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.

Russell family (Passions)

The Russell Family is a fictional family who appeared on American <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Passions">Passions</a>", which aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> (1999–2007) and later on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> (2007–08). The family was created by the soap's founder and <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> <a href="James%20E.%20Reilly">James E. Reilly</a>; it originally consisted of four characters—the married couple <a href="Eve%20Russell">Eve Russell</a> and T. C. Russell, and their children, Whitney and <a href="Simone%20Russell">Simone Russell</a>. The Russells are one of the four core families in the fictional town of Harmony, and are characterized by their friendship with the Bennetts and Lopez-Fitzgeralds and their feud with the Cranes. As the series progressed, four more characters were added to the family: Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister <a href="Liz%20Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a>; Eve's child with <a href="Julian%20Crane">Julian Crane</a>, <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a>; Whitney's husband and Liz's son, <a href="Chad%20Harris-Crane">Chad Harris-Crane</a>; and Eve's aunt Irma Johnson. Most of the characters left during the show's transition from NBC to DirecTV, leaving Eve and Vincent as the only representatives of the Russell family in the series finale.

The characters initially received negative feedback for their representation of an African-American family. They were praised by cast members, but <a href="Rodney%20Van%20Johnson">Rodney Van Johnson</a>, who played T. C., felt they were not used to their full potential. Despite the criticism, the cast was frequently nominated for <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Image Award</a>s and featured prominently in a series of public service announcements for <a href="Black%20History%20Month">Black History Month</a> in 2003. The Russell family also drew media and critical attention for storylines involving various <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> topics: Chad Harris-Crane's affair with Vincent and subsequent confusion about his sexual orientation, Simone's coming out as <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> to her family, and the revelation that Vincent was <a href="intersex">intersex</a>. While the show's treatment of <a href="Sexual%20identity">sexual</a> and <a href="gender%20identity">gender identity</a> has received mixed feedback from critics, "Passions" won the award for <a href="GLAAD%20Media%20Award%23Categories">Outstanding Daily Drama</a> at the <a href="17th%20GLAAD%20Media%20Awards">17th GLAAD Media Awards</a> for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality.

Along with the <a href="Bennett%20family%20%28Passions%29">Bennetts</a>, the <a href="Crane%20family">Cranes</a>, and the <a href="Lopez-Fitzgerald%20family">Lopez-Fitzgeralds</a>, the Russells are one of the four core families conceived by the "<a href="Passions">Passions</a>"' creator <a href="James%20E.%20Reilly">James E. Reilly</a>. They have featured prominently on the soap opera since its premiere on July 5, 1999. <a href="Sheraton%20Kalouria">Sheraton Kalouria</a>, senior vice president of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s daytime programming, said the decision to create and cast two minority families—the African-American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds—was a conscious effort to simulate the diversity of the United States, and that the cast reflected the show's "truly color–blind storytelling". Rodney Van Johnson, who played T. C. Russell, expressed an appreciation for the show's representation of "a full African-American family" that was involved in serious stories on daytime television rather than "just a flash in the pan", and also said that the Russell family received a considerable response from African-American viewers. An article in "<a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">Jet</a>" described each member of the Russell family as having an "integral part [in] the show" rather than appearing as <a href="Tokenism">token characters</a>.

Other "Passions" cast members agreed that the Russells were not portrayed as racial stereotypes; <a href="Tracey%20Ross">Tracey Ross</a> said her character Eve is "just a person" and is not purely defined by her race, and <a href="Charles%20Divins">Charles Divins</a>, who played Chad Harris-Crane, said the show's treatment of the Russells as "a strong African American family" was "refreshing." <a href="Amelia%20Marshall">Amelia Marshall</a>, who portrayed Liz Sanbourne, felt that the creation of seven African-American roles allowed each character to be unique:

During the soap opera's final years, Johnson expressed disappointment when the show began "taking out the people of color", such as Amelia Marshall, <a href="Brook%20Kerr">Brook Kerr</a> (who played Whitney Russell), and himself; he also said it was an obvious sign that "this thing is going down." Johnson identified racial diversity as one of the show's biggest draws, but added that the African-American actors were not used to their full potential. Following the departures of Johnson, Kerr, and <a href="Cathy%20Jen%C3%A9en%20Doe">Cathy Jenéen Doe</a>, the actress playing Simone Russell, in 2007, the only representatives of the Russells in the series finale were Tracey Ross and <a href="Phillip%20Jeanmarie">Phillip Jeanmarie</a> (who portrayed Vincent Clarkson).

Eve Russell is the matriarch of the Russell family and a respected doctor at Harmony Hospital. Her early storylines focus on her attempts to keep her past alcohol and drug abuse, and her relationship and child with Julian Crane, secret from her family and the rest of Harmony. Following the revelation of her past, she was characterized mainly through the rekindling of her romance with Julian and her tense relationship with their son Vincent Clarkson. Ross described Eve as "a contradiction inside an enigma." She based her performance on Catherine Halsey from <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>'s 1943 novel "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>", and Eve White from the 1957 film "<a href="The%20Three%20Faces%20of%20Eve">The Three Faces of Eve</a>".

Eve was played by Tracey Ross for the series' entire run, from its debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. Actresses Amanda Maiden and <a href="Kimberly%20Kevon%20Williams">Kimberly Kevon Williams</a> portrayed Eve in 2003 during flashbacks. A writer from "<a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">Jet</a>" praised Ross's depiction of Eve for broadening the representation of African-American characters on television. Ross's portrayal of the character was warmly received by viewers, who frequently rated her their favorite "Passions" actress in "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Digest">Soap Opera Digest</a>" polls. Eve and Julian's relationship was also seen positively by fans, who referred to the couple as "Evian." "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" listed Eve and Julian as one of the best soap-opera <a href="List%20of%20supercouples">supercouples</a>, praising the chemistry between Ross and co-star <a href="Ben%20Masters">Ben Masters</a>, "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Weekly">Soap Opera Weekly</a>" referred to the pairing as "the Odd Couple of "Passions"."

T. C. Russell is the patriarch of the Russell family. He is characterized by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a <a href="hit-and-run">hit-and-run</a> attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T. C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T. C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild his relationship with his ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T. C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.

T. C. was portrayed by Rodney Van Johnson from July 5, 1999 to June 19, 2007; Johnson was dropped to recurring status in December 2006 before his last appearance in June 2007. On March 19, 2001, Jerry Gaona played the character in flashbacks. Once T. C. was developed beyond the role of "the angry black man" and it became clear that the contents of his secret shed were not important to the plot, Johnson felt that his presence in the show was dramatically reduced. After being reduced to the status of a recurring cast member, he expressed doubt that he would return to the show in its final episodes. T. C.'s relationship with Eve, and Johnson's chemistry with Ross, did not receive much attention from the fans or the media. Other "Passions" cast members and representatives commented on the preference for Julian over T. C.; Masters said his character Julian should "just kick T. C. out of his house" and beat him with a 4x4, and a spokesperson from the show pushed Julian and Eve's romance to the forefront as "a new supercouple in Harmony" without any mention of T. C. Internationally, T. C. received a more positive response. African newspaper <a href="Mmegi">Mmegi</a> said Johnson was invited to the 2005 Miss Culture and Heritage contest in <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> due to his performance of T. C. as a "husband and father in the soap that warms the hearts of many in different countries".

Simone Russell is the youngest daughter of Eve and T. C. Russell, and is initially always seen in her older sister's shadow. She is first introduced as a part of a love triangle with Whitney and Chad, and an accomplice in <a href="Kay%20Bennett">Kay Bennett</a>'s schemes to seduce <a href="Miguel%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>. Simone receives more prominence after she announces she is a lesbian and begins a relationship with Rae Thomas. T. C. beats her after hearing about her relationship with Rae, but after much resistance, her family eventually supports her sexual identity. After learning Vincent killed Rae, Simone decides to leave Harmony with her sister to help her with her pregnancy, and to settle in New Orleans. Simone does not physically appear on screen after the show moved from NBC to DirecTV, but she is referenced through her letter to Kay before Kay's marriage to Miguel.

Over the course of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), <a href="Chrystee%20Pharris">Chrystee Pharris</a> (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and <a href="Cathy%20Jen%C3%A9en%20Doe">Cathy Jenéen Doe</a> (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian character to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" and "this is where [Simone] is  [...] I can assure you we're not going to make light of this particular topic." The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jenéen Doe's performance. "Passions" won the award for <a href="GLAAD%20Media%20Award%23Categories">Outstanding Daily Drama</a> at the <a href="17th%20GLAAD%20Media%20Awards">17th GLAAD Media Awards</a> for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, <a href="Sarah%20Warn">Sarah Warn</a>, former editor of entertainment website <a href="AfterEllen.com%20and%20TheBacklot.com">AfterEllen.com</a>, criticized the lesbian reveal as having "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl."

Whitney Russell is the eldest daughter of Eve and T. C. Russell. She is introduced as a close friend of <a href="Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane">Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane</a>, but she became prominent on the show as the love interest of Chad Harris-Crane. When Chad is incorrectly identified as Eve and Julian's son, his relationship with Whitney is judged to be incestuous. Whitney's confusion about her relationship with Chad, and her shame at possibly committing incest, escalates after she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their son, Miles Harris-Crane. Whitney briefly becomes estranged from Chad and Harmony, and becomes a nun to absolve herself of the sin of incest. The discovery of Chad's birth certificate proves the couple are not blood relatives; they resume their relationship and eventually marry. Whitney leaves Chad after discovering his affair with Vincent Clarkson. Their later reconciliation is cut short when he is murdered by Alistair Crane. Following Chad's death, Whitney moves to New Orleans to raise Miles, and her unborn child, with the help of Simone. Whitney does not appear on screen after the show moved from NBC to DirecTV, but she is referenced in a telephone call to police chief <a href="Sam%20Bennett%20%28Passions%29">Sam Bennett</a> and Simone's letter to her best friend Kay Bennett.

Whitney was portrayed by <a href="Brook%20Kerr">Brook Kerr</a> from the series' debut on July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007. In 2005, Sidne Siobhan Phillips portrayed the character in flashbacks. "Passions" casting director Jacklynn Briskey originally rejected 26-year-old Brook Kerr for the role of Whitney, believing she would look too mature to play a teenager. Despite this decision, Kerr's husband Christopher Warren submitted his wife's <a href="head%20shot">head shot</a>s to the network and she was hired to play the character. Kerr later described the week of auditioning and two <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>s to be formally cast in the role as an extremely quick process. While discussing her portrayal of the character, Kerr said, "I was always the sensible one, the friend everyone could count on, always doing what I should." Over the course of the series, media outlets frequently speculated on the exact nature of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The incest storyline led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where "half-siblings sleep with one another." "Soap Opera Digest" listed the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood as one of "Passions" most shocking secrets.

Vincent Clarkson, also known as Valerie Davis, is Eve and Julian's child; he is later revealed to be the blackmailer and serial rapist of the show's 2007 <a href="Passions%23Summertime%20extravaganzas">summertime extravaganza</a>. In the show's final episode on NBC, Vincent is revealed to be <a href="intersex">intersex</a> and Valerie Davis is shown to be his <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>. After the program moved to DirecTV, Vincent's storylines focused on his plan to torment Eve out of revenge for failing to prevent his abduction at birth, his sexual relationship with Julian, and his pregnancy with his father's child. Vincent teams up with <a href="Viki%20Chatsworth">Viki Chatsworth</a> to kill the main characters at the rehearsal dinner for a mass marriage of four of the show's couples. Vincent and Viki are arrested after <a href="Tabitha%20Lenox">Tabitha Lenox</a> sacrifices her magic to revive everyone.

Vincent was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie from December 26, 2006 – July 18, 2008; Valerie Davis was played by <a href="Daphn%C3%A9e%20Duplaix">Daphnée Duplaix</a> from December 16, 2004 – May 28, 2008 and temporarily by <a href="Siena%20Goines">Siena Goines</a> from January 30, 2007 – April 3, 2007. The character received mixed reactions from the show's cast and television critics. Jeanmarie described Vincent as representing the way in which "Passions" "pushed the boundaries and limits of what other soap operas didn't dare to do." On the other hand, Tracey Ross said the storyline of Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her "physically nauseous" and she could only complete the delivery scenes after the show's acting coach Maria O'Brien convinced her of "the comedic possibilities." Jamey Giddens of "<a href="Daytime%20Confidential">Daytime Confidential</a>" felt that Jeanmarie deserved an Emmy for making Vincent's outlandish situations believable. Josh Robertson of <a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">"Complex"</a> called Duplaix, who had been a <a href="Playboy%20Playmate">"Playboy" Playmate</a>, one of the most successful soap actresses for her performances as Valerie in 34 episodes of "Passions," along with her portrayal of <a href="Rachel%20Gannon">Rachel Gannon</a> in 95 episodes of "<a href="One%20Life%20to%20Live">One Life to Live</a>". Herndon L. Davis of "<a href="Windy%20City%20Times">Windy City Times</a>" criticized the show's representation of Vincent's sexual relationship with Chad as "a down-low storyline which involved an African-American man but eventually turned it into an outrageous intersex serial killer storyline."

Chad Harris-Crane is the main love interest and later husband of Whitney Russell; he is also the father of Miles Davis Harris-Crane and another child. Chad's early appearances focus on his search for his biological parents, and his love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone. Chad is initially believed to be Eve and Julian's child, which would make his relationship with Whitney incestuous. Chad's birth certificate later proves he was conceived when Alistair Crane raped Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. He reunites with Whitney without the stigma of incest. During his separation from Whitney, Chad initiates a sexual relationship with Vincent Clarkson and continues it after his marriage. He is unaware he is committing incest because he is Vincent's half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. After catching Chad having sex with Vincent, Whitney files for divorce; they later begin to reconcile through helping Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and <a href="Ethan%20Winthrop">Ethan Winthrop</a> reunite as a couple. Their potential reconciliation is cut short when Chad is murdered by Alistair.

Chad was portrayed by two actors over the course of the show: <a href="Donn%20Swaby">Donn Swaby</a> (1999 to 2002) and <a href="Charles%20Divins">Charles Divins</a> (2002 to 2007). Despite the controversy, and negative reception of Chad's sexual encounters with Vincent, Divins noted "the characters and their relationship [are] important aspects of the show." To prepare for the storyline, Divins consulted with his gay friends, and watched <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>'s discussion of the <a href="Down-low%20%28sexual%20slang%29">down-low</a> on her talk show "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>". Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television, while Swaby was disappointed by the direction Chad's storyline took. The character was a subject of parody on <a href="E%21">E!</a>'s weekly television series "<a href="The%20Soup">The Soup</a>", in which host <a href="Joel%20McHale">Joel McHale</a> turned a scene in which Chad insisted he was "not gay" despite his affair with Vincent into a <a href="running%20gag">running gag</a> by referring to the character as "Not Gay Chad." Divins—the principal actor to play Chad during the storylines focusing on the character's sexuality—made a cameo appearance on "The Soup"'s season five premiere.

Liz Sanbourne is the <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a> and <a href="Foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> to her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Initially identified only by her first name, Liz is first seen as the owner of a resort on the fictional St. Lisa's Island, located near Bermuda and the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>. Liz is still in love with her former boyfriend <a href="Antonio%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Brian O'Leary</a>. Her early appearances center on her attempts to reunite amnesiac <a href="Sheridan%20Crane">Sheridan Crane</a> with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, despite Brian's interest in her. When Liz arrives in Harmony, it is revealed that she is Eve's half-sister, and is later retconned to become her adoptive sister. Liz exposes Eve's past relationship with <a href="Julian%20Crane">Julian Crane</a>, inadvertently leading them to reunite and proving Chad Harris-Crane and Whitney Russell were not committing incest by her identification as Chad's mother. Liz harbors a deep desire for revenge against Eve for unknowingly abandoning her in an abusive household. Liz also seeks vengeance against the Crane family after she was raped by Alistair, and later forced to undergo surgery that made her barren. Liz leaves the show in February 2006, abandoning her vengeance against Eve, Julian, and Alistair to find a new life for herself.

Liz was portrayed by actress Amelia Marshall from October 3, 2001 to February 17, 2006. In 2003, Arreale Davis and Taquel Graves played the character in flashbacks. Amelia Marshall was hired for the role because of her past work with James E. Reilly on "<a href="Guiding%20Light">Guiding Light</a>". Marshall described her opinion of "Passions" prior to being approached with the role: ""[...] there were always these strange things happening on the show. It really pulls you in." She has commented that her decision to take on the role of Liz came from wanting to play characters that were different from her past appearances as Belinda Keffers in "<a href="All%20My%20Children">All My Children</a>", and Gilly Grant Speakes in "Guiding Light". In an interview with "<a href="Soap%20Talk">Soap Talk</a>", Marshall said, "I just love the fact that he saw me and realized that I could be such a witch." An article on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> noted that Marshall was removed due to changes in the show's budget.

Irma Johnson is the sister of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close relationship with her aunt because of their love of <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="blues">blues</a> music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a seedy Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, who is white, and her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did not speak for nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma to live in a <a href="retirement%20home">retirement home</a>, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.

In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, and brings her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by revealing her past to her family. Irma tells them Eve was once a prostitute and drug addict while living in Boston, and was involved in a relationship with Julian, who is T. C.'s sworn enemy. The revelations destroy Eve and T. C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a whore or a slut. When Eve's daughter <a href="%23Simone%20Russell">Simone</a> tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously been kind to her, tells Simone homosexuality is vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress <a href="Marla%20Gibbs">Marla Gibbs</a> on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.

The Russell family received further attention when the actors participated in <a href="public%20service%20announcement">public service announcement</a>s (PSAs) to celebrate the achievements of African-Americans in commemoration of <a href="Black%20History%20Month">Black History Month</a>. The PSAs ran on NBC stations throughout February 2003. Tracey Ross and Rodney Van Johnson made cameo appearances as Eve Russell and T. C. Russell in the series finale of the NBC primetime drama "<a href="Providence%20%28TV%20series%29">Providence</a>", marking one of the first daytime/primetime crossovers.

Members of the Russell family were featured in "<a href="Hidden%20Passions">Hidden Passions</a>", a 2001 <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a> novel promoted as Tabitha Lenox's journal exposing the town's secrets sent into <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a> by her magical doll <a href="Timmy%20Lenox">Timmy Lenox</a>. The book documents Eve's past drug abuse, relationship with Julian Crane, and the kidnapping of her son Vincent Clarkson. It also covers T. C. Russell's accident and his first meeting and courtship with Eve.

Following DirecTV's decision to not renew the show, "Passions" partnered with Premiere Props to hold a public two-day estate sale of props and costumes from the show. Stacey Ward, a director of <a href="NBCUniversal">NBCUniversal</a>, pitched the auction as "an opportunity to own a piece of their favorite show". Several items related to the Russell family were offered for sale, including Vincent's disguise as the "Blackmailer" (without the mask) and Eve's medical coat splattered with blood from her botched surgery on Julian.

The show initially received mostly negative reviews for its lack of focus on the Russells in comparison to the other three core families. Reviewing the soap opera's first weeks, television critic Hal Boedeker of the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" criticized the show for relegating the Russell family to "spend[ing] most of their time listening to the problems of the white Bennetts" and questioned its attempt at "racial progress." The Russells were described as having received less screen time than other characters by "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>"s Tamara Ikenberg, who commented that the series appeared to revolve around three families as opposed to four. Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" felt the Russells only served to represent the fact that "Harmony also seems to contain exactly one black family." In contrast, David Alexander Nahmod of the "<a href="Bay%20Area%20Reporter">Bay Area Reporter</a>" praised the show for "present[ing] an almost utopian picture of racial harmony in the town of Harmony" by not showing racial inequality or strife. Despite the focus on an African-American family, Lynette Rice of "Entertainment Weekly" said the show failed to attract the "hard-to-reach audience [of] African-American women"; Sheraton Kalouria said, "quite frankly, many of them aren't aware "Passions" is even on."

"Passions" received two Daytime Drama awards at the American Scene Awards. These awards were given to recognize the diversity in the show's cast, which was praised for "ensuring diversity in casting and storylines from the very beginning" and "exemplifi[ng] the richness of the American scene on daytime television." "Passions" was the only soap opera to win the award twice in a row. Kerr was nominated for <a href="List%20of%20Soap%20Opera%20Digest%20Awards">Outstanding Younger Lead Actress</a>, and, along with co-stars Lindsay Hartley and <a href="Justin%20Hartley">Justin Hartley</a>, was nominated for Favorite Triangle at the 2005 "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Digest%20Awards">Soap Opera Digest Awards</a>". Doe was listed as a pre-nominee for the <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Supporting%20Actress%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series</a> for the <a href="34th%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">34th Daytime Emmy Awards</a> alongside co-star Emily Harper, but was not chosen as one of the final nominees.

The actors were also frequently nominated for <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Image Award</a>s. Ross received eight nominations for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series and won the award at the <a href="38th%20NAACP%20Image%20Awards">38th NAACP Image Awards</a> for her portrayal of Eve. Ross has cited Eve as expanding the TV representation of African-Americans and interracial relationships. For her performance as Whitney, Kerr was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series at the 39th NAACP Image Awards. Gibbs received positive feedback for her performance as Irma; she earned a nomination for the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Daytime%20Drama%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series</a> at the <a href="37th%20NAACP%20Image%20Awards">37th NAACP Image Awards</a>.

Joseph Priestley House

The Joseph Priestley House was the American home of 18th-century British <a href="theologian">theologian</a>, <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenting</a> <a href="clergyman">clergyman</a>, <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosopher</a> (and discoverer of oxygen), educator, and <a href="political%20philosophy">political theorist</a> <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> (1733–1804) from 1798 until his death. Located in <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland, Pennsylvania</a>, the house, which was designed by Priestley's wife Mary, is <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> with <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federalist</a> accents. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC) operated it as a museum dedicated to Joseph Priestley from 1970 to August 2009, when it closed due to low visitation and budget cuts. The house reopened in October 2009, still owned by the PHMC but operated by the Friends of Joseph Priestley House (FJPH).

Fleeing religious persecution and political turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys emigrated to the United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during the last ten years of his life.

After the Priestleys died, their home remained in private hands until the turn of the 20th century, when George Gilbert Pond, a professor from what is now <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a>, bought it and attempted to found the first Priestley museum. He died before he could complete the project and it was not until the 1960s that the house was first carefully restored by the PHMC and designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. A second renovation was undertaken in the 1990s to return the home to the way it looked during Priestley's time. The home has been a frequent place of celebration for the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a>; they commemorated the centennial and bicentennial of the discovery of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> gas by Priestley as well as the 250th anniversary of Priestley's birth.

Following the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central <a href="Susquehanna%20Valley">Susquehanna Valley</a>, including in the area that would become <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland, Pennsylvania</a>. Northumberland was <a href="Urban%20planning">laid out</a> around a central <a href="village%20green">village green</a> in 1772, on land originally purchased from the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> by the <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Province of Pennsylvania</a> in 1768, as part of the first <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>. During the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, the village was evacuated as part of the <a href="Big%20Runaway">Big Runaway</a> in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> and <a href="Methodism">Wesleyan</a> meeting houses, a <a href="brewery">brewery</a>, two <a href="pottery">potteries</a>, a <a href="potash">potash</a> manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses.
The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>500 (£  in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the <a href="Land%20grant">patent</a> to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally "North Way", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the <a href="North%20Shore%20Railroad%20%28Pennsylvania%29">North Shore Railroad</a> to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The <a href="confluence%20%28geography%29">confluence</a> of the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).

The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Canal%20%28North%20Branch%20Division%29">Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division)</a> was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river. On May 31, 1860, the <a href="Lackawanna%20and%20Bloomsburg%20Railroad">Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad</a> opened with a train from <a href="Danville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Danville</a>. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran behind the house. The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's course through the front yard; the track behind the house no longer exists.

The last three years the Priestleys spent in Britain were a time of political upheaval and the persecution they experienced led to their eventual emigration to the United States. During the <a href="Priestley%20Riots">Birmingham Riots of 1791</a>, which began on the second anniversary of the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a> in the wake of the conservative British reaction against the <a href="French%20revolution">French revolution</a>, the Priestleys' home, Joseph's church, and the homes of many other <a href="English%20dissenters">religious Dissenters</a> were burned. The Priestleys fled <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and attempted to live in <a href="London">London</a>, but they could not escape the political turmoil. In 1794, they joined the tide of 10,000 emigrants who moved to America—it was the largest emigration from Europe to America until the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. The Priestleys left Britain at the beginning of April on the "Samson" and arrived in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on June 4, 1794. Two of their three sons, Joseph, Jr. (eldest) and Harry (youngest), had already emigrated to the United States in August 1793, along with Joseph Priestley's friend, the radical activist <a href="Thomas%20Cooper%20%28US%20politician%29">Thomas Cooper</a>. Their middle son, <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a>, had moved to America from France, probably early in 1793, following the <a href="September%20massacres">September massacres</a> of the previous year.

Although Europeans knew Priestley best as a scientist (he had discovered <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> gas in 1774), Americans knew him best as a defender of religious freedom and as an advocate for <a href="American%20Revolution">American independence</a>. Immediately upon his arrival, he was <a href="wikt%3Af%C3%AAte">fêted</a> by various political factions vying to gain his support. Priestley declined their entreaties, however, hoping to avoid the political discord that had embroiled him in Britain. He wrote to <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> that he "made it a rule to take no part whatever in the politics of a country in which I am a stranger, and in which I only wish to live undisturbed". (Priestley never became a citizen of the United States.) He also turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> at this time.

On their way to Northumberland, the Priestleys stopped in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, where Joseph gave a series of sermons that helped promote the spread of <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarianism</a>. According to J. D. Bowers, who studied Priestley's influence on Unitarianism in America, "[f]or a decade Priestley served as the inspiration and leading force in the spread of Unitarianism in America and the formation of numerous societies that followed his teachings on congregational formation, the education of youth, lay preaching, and espousing one's faith in the presence of opposition from (and to) both the Protestant majority and a competing liberal faction." Through Priestley's influence, at least twelve congregations were founded in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky, including the <a href="First%20Unitarian%20Church%20of%20Philadelphia">First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia</a> and Northumberland's Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Susquehanna Valley. When he preached, Unitarians and non-Unitarians flocked to hear him and his sermons were published throughout the country. During his years in America, Priestley became increasingly convinced that the <a href="Millennialism">Millennium</a> was approaching. His close study of the Bible, together with the happenings in France, persuaded him that he would see Christ's return.
While Priestley enjoyed preaching in Philadelphia, he could not afford the expense of living there; he also disliked the city's opulent <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>s and feared the <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic that had recently decimated the city. He considered settling in <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Germantown</a>, which had better access to transportation and communication than Northumberland, but Mary preferred the country and wanted to be near her sons. Joseph considered splitting his time between Northumberland and Philadelphia, but this plan became impractical. Determined to ensure the future economic stability of his family, Priestley bought land and settled in Northumberland by July 1794, which was "five days of rough travel" north of Philadelphia. There they hoped a larger community would eventually blossom.

Priestley seems to have yearned for a more cosmopolitan community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was "seemingly almost out of the world" and complaining that he had to wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend <a href="John%20Vaughan%20%28wine%20merchant%29">John Vaughan</a>: "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very "distant from my original views" and "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was "very thankful for such an asylum" and he attempted "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners."

Priestley's son Joseph Priestley Jr. was a leading member of a consortium that purchased of land along <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a> (between the North and <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branches</a> of the Susquehanna River). Shortly thereafter, <a href="Thomas%20Cooper%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">Thomas Cooper</a>, a friend of Joseph Priestley's, published a pamphlet in Britain titled "Some Information Respecting America", meant to encourage others to settle in Pennsylvania and offering instructions on how to do so. It detailed a clear plan for establishing and financing a settlement. The French translation, "Renseignemens sur l'Amérique", was, according to one scholar, "carefully phrased in legal terminology" and "lucidly outline[d] an ambitious financial venture". However, it is unclear whether Cooper's scheme was related to the lands that the younger Priestleys had purchased.
Apparently technically unrelated to either of these schemes, but influenced by Cooper's, poets <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> and <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, full of idealism and angered at Priestley's treatment in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, intended to emigrate to America and establish a <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n community which they called "Pantisocracy" (derived from the Greek for "equal rule of all"). They assembled twelve couples who were interested not only in demanding physical labor but also in a life of the mind, but none of them had enough money to embark on the project, which required much capital. Therefore, the poets undertook a lecture tour of England to raise funds; however, they never generated enough money and never emigrated. The utopia was not built and few immigrants arrived in Northumberland as a result of Cooper's schemes.

After the failure of Cooper's endeavor, Priestley attempted to convince other friends to move to Northumberland, particularly those he had made in America, but to no avail. Priestley wrote in his "Memoirs" that "the settlement was given up, but being here, and my wife and myself liking the place, I have determined to take up my residence here, though subject to many disadvantages. Philadelphia was excessively expensive, and this a comparatively cheap place; and my sons, settling in the neighborhood, will be less exposed to temptation, and more likely to form habits of sobriety and industry."

Priestley's attempts to avoid political controversy in the United States failed. In 1794, the journalist <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a> published "Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley", which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer <a href="John%20Hurford%20Stone">John Hurford Stone</a> and the liberal novelist <a href="Helen%20Maria%20Williams">Helen Maria Williams</a>. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley and his friends were fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.

Family matters also made Priestley's time in America difficult. His youngest son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; she was already ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: "This day I bury my wife...she had taken much thought in planning the new house and now that it is far advanced and promises to be everything she wished, she is removed to another." After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the "Reading Advertiser" to falsely accuse Priestley's son <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a>, of trying to poison them with arsenic.

Priestley continued the educational projects that had been important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a "Northumberland Academy" and donating his library to the fledgling institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who used the advice when founding the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>. Jefferson and Priestley became close and when he had completed his "General History of the Christian Church", he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that "it is now only that I can say I see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me." Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume "General History" that was the most important. Stretching from 475 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a> to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its "corruptions", referencing his own "<a href="An%20History%20of%20the%20Corruptions%20of%20Christianity">An History of the Corruptions of Christianity</a>" (1772–74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.

Priestley attempted to continue his scientific investigations in America with the support of the American Philosophical Association. However, he was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending the outmoded <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a> against the "<a href="Chemical%20revolution">new chemistry</a>", he also did some original work on <a href="spontaneous%20generation">spontaneous generation</a> and dreams. As Robert Schofield, Priestley's major modern biographer, explains:

Priestley published more scientific items during his decade in the United States than during all his years in England: some 45 papers, not counting reprintings, and four pamphlets, not counting subsequent editions, but in general his science was now anticlimactic. Few of his papers contributed anything significantly new to the field of chemistry; most were committed to combatting the new chemistry.

Despite Priestley's reduced scientific importance, he stimulated an interest in chemistry in America.

By 1801, Priestley had become so ill that he could no longer write or experiment effectively. On February 3, 1804, Joseph started a last experiment in his lab but was too weak to continue it. He went to a bed in his library, where he died three days later. He was buried in nearby Riverview Cemetery in Northumberland. Priestley's epitaph reads:

Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that "he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself" and was probably the first "scientifically-equipped laboratory" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (which he called "heavy inflammable air"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.

The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style, the "balance and symmetry" of the architecture signaled "subdued elegance". The house was accented with <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federalist</a> highlights, such as "the <a href="fanlight">fanlight</a>s over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase", marking it as distinctly American. Douglas R. McMinn, in the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> nomination for the <a href="Northumberland%20Historic%20District">Northumberland Historic District</a>, calls it a "mansion" that is "probably the finest example of the Federal style in the region". As William N. Richardson, the site administrator for the Joseph Priestley House in the 1990s, notes, Priestley's American home did not resemble his "high-style Georgian town house" that was destroyed in Birmingham; rather, it was "plain" and built in the "American vernacular".

The house has a two-and-half story central section, which is 48 feet (14.6 m) by 43 feet (13.1 m), and two one-story wings on the north and south sides that are each 22 feet (6.7 m) by 21 feet (6.4 m). The first and second floors have a total area of 5,052 square feet (469 m²). The north wing was the laboratory and the south wing (which had an attached woodshed) was the summer kitchen. The cellar, first, and second floors of the central section are each divided into four rooms, with a central hall on the first and second floors; the first floor also has an intersecting hall that leads to the laboratory. The attic has three rooms for servants and a larger room for storage. A paint analysis done in 1994 revealed that the house had no wall paper initially and that the walls and woodwork were painted "a brilliant white".
The house is a frame structure, covered with white wooden <a href="clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a>s, anchored to a stone foundation. The Priestleys built their home out of wood, dried in trenches on the site, because no stone or brick was available in the area. Joseph wrote a detailed description of the drying process, concluding: "A house constructed with such boards I prefer to one of brick and stone". This may have prompted journalist <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a> to caustically label the house a "shed" in one of his political tirades against Joseph. The central section of the house has a slate gable roof with a railing-enclosed deck. The house has "three internal gable end chimneys, one for the main kitchen", and one each at the north and south ends of the central section.

The house faces the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>, and both the front and rear doors are "sheltered by a shallow portico". A circular carriage drive (originally gravel, now concrete) leads to the front door, which also has a fanlight. There are five windows on the second floor on both the front and rear sides of the house, with a <a href="dentil">dentil</a> cornice above both sets of windows. The external details on the house also include a "frieze board with <a href="triglyph">triglyph</a>s".

Originally, delightful panoramic views were visible from the home. It was built facing the Susquehanna River so that visitors arriving by boat could be welcomed by the family and because conventional 18th-century aesthetic theory held that countryscapes were more beautiful than townscapes. Priestley built a high wall blocking the view of Northumberland and added a <a href="belvedere%20%28structure%29">belvedere</a> to the top of his house to more easily survey the landscape. His plantings were "a much scaled-down version of the beautiful gardens" at <a href="Bowood%20House">Bowood</a>, the estate of his former employer <a href="William%20Petty%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Shelburne">Lord Shelburne</a>.

The lack of skilled craftspeople in Northumberland made the construction of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.

After the deaths of Mary and Joseph Priestley, Joseph Priestley, Jr. and his wife, Elizabeth Ryland, continued to live in the house until 1811, at which time they emigrated to Britain and sold the home. The house passed through various hands during the 19th century. Judge Seth Chapman purchased the house from Joseph Priestley Jr. on May 13, 1815 for <a href="US%20dollar">US$</a>6,250 ($  in 2019). Chapman died on December 4, 1835, and Rev. James Kay, pastor of the Northumberland Unitarian congregation, and his family lived in the house next. James Kay died on September 22, 1847 and his widow probably lived in the house until her October 2, 1850 death. Charles H. Kay, son of James, had purchased the house in 1845, a few years before his parents' deaths. In April 1865 Charles Kay's children sold the house to Henry R. Campbell for $2,775 ($  in 2019). Florence Bingham purchased the house from Campbell for $5,679.53 on January 18, 1868 ($  in 2019), and Bingham's heirs sold it to T. Hugh Johnson for $2,000 on October 7, 1882 ($  in 2019). Kate Scott bought the house for $3,000 on April 11, 1888 ($  in 2019). In 1911 the last private resident moved out of the house, and it was sublet to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> for its workers (a large railroad yard was built in Northumberland at this time). This led to a general decline in the house and its grounds.
Professor George Gilbert Pond was the first person to make a significant effort to establish a permanent Priestley museum at the Priestley House. After raising sufficient funds, he managed to purchase the home at auction for $6,000 from Scott's heirs on November 24, 1919 ($  in 2019). Pond believed that construction of a new railroad line would destroy the house, and so intended to move it to Pennsylvania State College (now <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a>). However, he died on May 20, 1920 before this plan could be enacted; the planned rail line was never built and the house proved too fragile to move. The college established a memorial fund in Pond's honor and retained the house as a museum, although Pond's children did not formally transfer the house to the college until April 14, 1932. Some restoration of the house was done in the 1920s, and a small, brick building—intended as a fireproof museum for Priestley's books and scientific apparatus—was built on the grounds and dedicated to Pond's memory in 1926. In 1941 the state legislature tried to have the State Historical Commission administer the house as a museum, but <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Pennsylvania">Governor</a> <a href="Arthur%20James%20%28politician%29">Arthur James</a> vetoed the plan for lack of funding.

On December 14, 1955, the college donated the house to the borough of Northumberland. From 1955 to 1959 the house served as both the borough hall for Northumberland and as a museum. The house proved too costly for the borough to maintain, and was acquired by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1961. Eventually, in 1968 the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Historical%20and%20Museum%20Commission">Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission</a> (PHMC) began restoring it and in October 1970 the museum was opened to the public. The renovations included a restoration of the laboratory, a removal of ornamentation added in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, a return of doorways to their original locations, and a return of the shutters "to their original locations inside the windows". The PHMC was supported by "The Friends of the Joseph Priestley House" (FJPH), who help with the visitor center, tours, special events, and outreach, as well as with clerical and museum work.
Between 1998 and 1999 a renovation that was "one of the most extensive changes in the homestead's history" set out to "restore the grounds around the house to exactly the way it was when Priestley lived" there. This involved reconstructing exact replicas of the original carriage barn, hog sties, horse stalls, gardens, fences, and even the <a href="latrine">privy</a>. These structures were based on T. Lambourne's drawings of the house and grounds that had been discovered in 1983, other records, and excavations. Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive <a href="fume%20hood">fume hood</a>. The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible.

After Joseph's death, Thomas Cooper sold a collection of some of his friend's apparatus and other personal belongings to <a href="Dickinson%20College">Dickinson College</a> in <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Pennsylvania">Carlisle</a>, which exhibits it each year when presenting the school's Priestley Award to a scientist who makes "discoveries which contribute to the welfare of mankind". The house lost its original furnishings when Joseph Jr. and his family moved back to England. Since it is not known what was originally in the home, it is furnished and decorated with artifacts donated by descendants of the Priestleys and with ones similar to those listed in Priestley's testament of what was lost in the fire at his Birmingham home. A number of items that belonged to Joseph and Mary during their lives both in Britain and America are on display throughout the house, including Joseph's balance scales and microscope. Portraits, prints, maps, charts, and books have been carefully selected to replicate the Priestleys' holdings. A bedroom on the second floor is dedicated to an exploration of the life of an 18th-century woman.

On January 12, 1965, the Joseph Priestley House was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> and it was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) on October 15, 1966. On August 1, 1994, the American Chemical Society named it the second <a href="ACS%20National%20Historical%20Chemical%20Landmarks">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a>; the dedication ceremony was attended by 75 Priestley descendants. In 1988, the <a href="Northumberland%20Historic%20District">Northumberland Historic District</a>, including the Priestley House (which it describes as a "gem" and one of the finest Federal style buildings in central Pennsylvania), was listed on the NRHP. The district includes one other building already on the NRHP: the <a href="Priestley-Forsyth%20Memorial%20Library">Priestley-Forsyth Memorial Library</a>, which was built as an inn around 1820 and was owned by a great-grandson of the Priestleys in the 1880s. Today it serves as Northumberland's public library. The Joseph Priestley Memorial Chapel, which is a <a href="contributing%20property">contributing structure</a> in the historic district, was built in 1834 by his grandson, and is home to a Unitarian Universalist congregation that considers Priestley its founder.

Under the PHMC, the museum was open ten months a year, closing between early January and early March. In 2007 and 2008 the number of visitors held steady after recent declines. According to the PHMC, in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal</a> 2007–08 "total visitation ... was 1,705 with a paid visitation of 1,100 generating $4,125 in program revenue and 2,406 recreational and non-ticketed visitors". The fiscal 2006–07 operations budget for the house and its two full-time staff was $142,901, with $6,900 (five percent) coming from FJPH and the rest from the state of Pennsylvania.
On March 4, 2009 the PHMC released a report examining its 22 museums and historic sites and recommended discontinuing operations at six, including the Joseph Priestley House. The proposed closure of the Priestley House was based on "low visitation and limited potential for growth". Despite public meetings, protest letters, and a general "public outcry" against closure, on August 14, 2009 the state closed the Priestley House and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. The sole remaining state employee at Priestley House was furloughed. That month the Friends of the Joseph Priestley House submitted a plan to the PHMC to operate the house on weekends from May to October with staffing provided by volunteers. The plan depended both on acquiring insurance for the volunteers, the house, and its contents, and on the state passing a budget.

On September 24, 2009 the PHMC and officers of the FJPH signed an agreement to reopen the museum on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The house reopened on October 3, with volunteer staffing from the FJPH. The agreement can be renewed annually and lets FJPH "schedule programs, set fees and be in charge of all the business aspects of running the site". On November 1, there was a "grand reopening celebration" at the house with a dozen costumed volunteer guides and chemical demonstrations in Priestley's laboratory. On November 7, 2010 the brick Pond building was rededicated after an $85,000 renovation, as part of the museum's annual "Fall Heritage Day". The restoration, which had been planned for years, was paid for by private donors and included "handicapped accessibility, new roofing, heating and air-conditioning and new interior walls, ceilings and lighting". The FJPH plan to install a timeline of Priestley's scientific work and times in the Pond building, as well as a video about his laboratory techniques and impact today.

The American Chemical Society (ACS) has used the Joseph Priestley House as a place to mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, "seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to celebrate the centennial of chemistry". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating <a href="mercuric%20oxide">mercuric oxide</a> with a magnifying lens and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school "is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).

Representatives of the ACS were present at the October 1970 dedication of the house as a museum. On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton</a> came to visit the home. The <a href="Priestley%20Medal">Priestley Medal</a>, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to <a href="Paul%20Flory">Paul Flory</a> at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is on display at the house.) On August 1, 1974—what has been labeled the bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen—over 500 chemists attending the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at <a href="State%20College%2C%20Pennsylvania">State College</a> traveled to the house to celebrate "Oxygen Day". In October 1976, the ACS celebrated its own centennial with a celebration in Northumberland. A 100-plus piece replica of Priestley's laboratory equipment, made by universities, corporations, and the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, was presented to the house for display. On April 13, 1983, ACS President <a href="Fred%20Basolo">Fred Basolo</a> spoke at the house to celebrate Priestley's 250th birthday and as part of a <a href="first%20day%20of%20issue">first day of issue</a> ceremony for the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service's</a> Joseph Priestley commemorative stamp. In 2001 the ACS again met at the house to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the society, and reenacted parts of the 1874 and 1926 celebrations, including a march to Priestley's grave, at which each participant left a red rose.
