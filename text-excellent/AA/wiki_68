Red-bellied black snake

The red-bellied black snake ("Pseudechis porphyriacus") is a species of <a href="elapidae">elapid</a> <a href="snake">snake</a> native to Australia. Described by <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> in 1794, it is one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around in length, it has glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked. Although its venom is capable of causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s, <a href="myotoxin">myotoxin</a>s, <a href="Coagulation%23Procoagulants">coagulants</a> and has <a href="Hemolysis">haemolytic</a> properties; victims can also lose their sense of smell. 

Common in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), but its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations.

The red-bellied black snake was described by the English naturalist <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> in "Zoology of New Holland" (1794) as "Coluber porphyriacus". Incorrectly assuming it was harmless, he wrote, "This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature." The species name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "porphyreus", which can mean "dark purple", "red-purple" or "beauteous". It was the first Australian <a href="Elapidae">elapid</a> snake described. The <a href="syntype">syntype</a> is presumed lost. French naturalist <a href="Bernard%20Germain%20de%20Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de">Bernard Germain de Lacépède</a> described it under the name "Trimeresurus leptocephalus" in 1804. His countryman <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Lesson">René Lesson</a> described it as "Acanthophis tortor" in 1826. German biologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> felt it was allied with cobras and called it "Naja porphyrica" in 1837.
The genus "<a href="Pseudechis">Pseudechis</a>" was created for it by German biologist <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Wagler">Johann Georg Wagler</a> in 1830, to which several more species have been added subsequently. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words "pseudēs" "false", and "echis" "viper". Snake expert <a href="Eric%20Worrell">Eric Worrell</a>, in 1961, analysed the skulls of the genus and found that of the red-bellied black snake to be the most divergent. Its position as an early offshoot from the rest of the genus has been confirmed genetically in 2017.

Snake handler <a href="Raymond%20Hoser">Raymond Hoser</a> described two extra subspecies in 2003: "Pseudechis porphyriacus eipperi" from the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> and surrounds in North-east Queensland, which he noted was smaller, rarely attaining 2 m (7 ft) and had a white or pale pink rather than red belly, and "Pseudechis porphyriacus rentoni" from southeastern South Australia, which has a variable-coloured (often orange or even blueish-tinged) belly. He added that both were disjunct from the main red-bellied black snake population, and as the distinguishing traits of "P. porphyriacus rentoni" were not consistent then location was the most reliable way of identifying it. These subspecies have not been recognized by other authors, and Hoser has been strongly criticized for identifying some taxa on location alone, and omitting, misinterpreting or inventing evidence of distinctness.

As well as red-bellied black snake, the species has been called common black snake, redbelly and RBBS.

The red-bellied black snake has a glossy black top body with a light-grey snout and brown mouth, and a completely black tail. It lacks a well-defined neck, its head merges seamlessly into the body. Its flanks are bright red or orange, fading to pink or dull red on the belly. All these scales have black margins. Snakes from northern populations tend to have lighter, more cream or pink bellies. The red-bellied black snake is on average around long, the largest individual recorded at . Males are generally slightly larger than females. A large specimen caught in Newcastle has been estimated to weigh around . The red-bellied black snake can have a strong smell, which some field experts have used to find the snakes in the wild.

Like all elapid snakes, it is <a href="Snake_skeleton%23Proteroglyph">proteroglyphous</a> (front-fanged). Juveniles are similar to the <a href="eastern%20small-eyed%20snake">eastern small-eyed snake</a> ("Cryptophis nigrescens"), with which it can be easily confused, although the latter species lacks the red flanks. Other similar species include the <a href="blue-bellied%20black%20snake">blue-bellied black snake</a> ("Pseudechis guttatus") and copperheads of the genus "<a href="Austrelaps">Austrelaps</a>". An early misconception was that the red-bellied black snake was <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, and that the <a href="eastern%20brown%20snake">eastern brown snake</a> ("Pseudonaja textilis") was the female form. This was recognised as such by Australian zoologist <a href="Gerard%20Krefft">Gerard Krefft</a> in his 1869 work "Snakes of Australia".

The number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The red-bellied black snake has 17 rows of <a href="dorsal%20scales">dorsal scales</a> at midbody, 180 to 215 ventral scales, 48 to 60 <a href="subcaudal%20scales">subcaudal scales</a> (the anterior—and sometimes all—subcaudals are undivided), and a divided <a href="anal%20scale">anal scale</a>. There are two anterior and two posterior temporal scales, and the rostral shield is roughly square-shaped.

The red-bellied black snake is native to the east coast of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, where it is one of the most commonly encountered snakes. It can be found in the urban forest, woodland, plains and bushland areas of the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>, <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> and <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. The <a href="Macquarie%20Marshes">Macquarie Marshes</a> mark a western border to its distribution in New South Wales, and <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Queensland">Gladstone</a> in central Queensland marks the northern limit to the main population. To the south, it occurs across eastern and central Victoria, and extends along the Murray River into South Australia. There are disjunct populations in the southern <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in South Australia, and in North Queensland.

The red-bellied black snake is most commonly seen close to dams, streams, <a href="billabong">billabong</a>s and other bodies of water, although they can venture up to away,
including into nearby backyards. In particular, the red-bellied black snake prefers areas of shallow water with tangles of water plants, logs or debris.

Red-bellied black snakes can hide in multiple places in their habitat including logs, old mammal burrows and grass tussocks. They can flee into water and hide there; one was reported as staying submerged for 23 minutes. When swimming they may hold their full head or the nostrils above the water's surface. At times they may float without moving on the water surface looking like a stick. Within their habitat, red-bellied black snakes appear to have ranges or territories that they are familiar with and generally remain within. A 1987 field study in three New South Wales localities found that these areas vary widely, from in size. Within their territory, they may have some preferred places to reside.

The red-bellied black snake is generally not an aggressive species, typically withdrawing when approached. If provoked, it will recoil into a striking stance as a threat, holding its head and front part of its body horizontally above the ground and widening and flattening its neck. It may bite as a last resort. It is generally active by day, though nighttime activity has occasionally been recorded. When not hunting or basking it may be found beneath timber, rocks and rubbish or down holes and burrows.

Snakes are active when their body temperatures are between . They also <a href="Thermoregulation">thermoregulate</a> by basking in warm sunny spots in the cool early morning and rest in shade in the middle of hot days, and may reduce their activity in hot dry weather in late summer and autumn. Rather than entering true hibernation, red-bellied black snakes become relatively inactive over winter retreating to cover and at times emerging on warm, sunny days. Their dark colour allows them to absorb heat from sunshine more quickly. In July 1949, six large individuals were found hibernating under a concrete slab in marshland in <a href="Woy%20Woy%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Woy Woy, New South Wales</a>. Groups of up to six hibernating red-bellied black snakes have been recorded from under concrete slabs around <a href="Mount%20Druitt">Mount Druitt</a> and <a href="Rooty%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rooty Hill</a> in western Sydney. Males are more active in the southern hemisphere spring (early October to November) as they roam looking for mates; one reportedly travelled in a day. In summer, both sexes are less active generally.

The diet of the red-bellied black snake primarily consists of <a href="frog">frog</a>s, but it also preys on <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s and small <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. They also eat other snakes, including those of their own species. Fish are hunted in water. Red-bellied black snakes may hunt on the water surface or underwater, and prey can be eaten underwater or brought to the surface. They have been recorded stirring up substrate, possibly to disturb prey. As red-bellied black snakes grow and mature, they continue to eat the same size prey but add larger animals as well. Although they prefer live food, red-bellied black snakes have been reported eating frogs squashed by cars.

They are susceptible to <a href="cane%20toad">cane toad</a> ("Rhinella marina") toxins. The introduction of <a href="cane%20toads%20in%20Australia">cane toads in Australia</a> dates to 1935, when they were introduced in an attempt at biological control of native beetles which were damaging sugar cane fields (a non-native plant). The intervention failed, mostly because the toads are on the ground while the beetles feed on leaves at the top of the plant. One research study concluded that in less than 75 years the red-bellied black snake had evolved in toad-inhabited regions of Australia to have increased resistance to toad toxin and decreased preference for toads as prey.

In spring, male red-bellied black snakes often engage in ritualised combat for anywhere from 2 to 30 minutes, even attacking other males already mating with females. They wrestle vigorously but rarely bite, and engage in head-pushing contests, where each snake tries to push his opponents' head downward with his chin.

The male seeks out a female and rubs his chin on her body, and may twitch, hiss and rarely bite as he becomes aroused. The female indicates readiness to mate by straightening out and allowing their bodies to align. Pregnancy takes place any time from early spring to late summer. Females become much less active and band together in small groups in late pregnancy. They share the same retreat and bask in the sun together. The red-bellied black snake is <a href="Ovoviviparity">ovoviviparous</a>; that is, it gives birth to live young in individual membranous sacs, after 14 weeks' gestation, usually in February or March. The young, numbering between eight and forty, emerge from their sacs very shortly after birth, and have an average length of about . Young snakes almost triple their length and increase their weight 18-fold in their first year of life, and are sexually mature when they reach <a href="wikt%3Asvl">SVL</a> (snoutvent length) of for males or for females. Females can breed at around 31 months of age, while males can slightly earlier. Red-bellied black snakes can live for up to 25 years.

Early settlers feared the red-bellied black snake, though it turned out to be much less dangerous than many other species. The <a href="mice">murine</a> <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) is 2.52 mg/kg when administered <a href="subcutaneous%20injection">subcutaneously</a>. A red-bellied black snake yields an average of 37 mg of venom when milked, with the maximum recorded being 94 mg. It accounted for 16% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, with no deaths recorded. Its venom contains <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s, <a href="myotoxin">myotoxin</a>s, <a href="Coagulation%23Procoagulants">coagulants</a> and also has <a href="Hemolysis">haemolytic</a> properties.

Bites from red-bellied black snakes can be very painful—needing <a href="analgesic">analgesia</a>—and result in local swelling, prolonged bleeding and even local <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, particularly if the bite is on a finger. Severe local reactions may require surgical debridement or even amputation. Symptoms of systemic envenomation—including nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, <a href="diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a> or excessive sweating—were thought to be rare, but a 2010 review found they occurred in most bite victims. Most people also go on to develop an anticoagulant <a href="coagulopathy">coagulopathy</a> in a few hours. This is characterised by a raised <a href="partial%20thromboplastin%20time">aPTT</a> (activated partial thromboplastin time), and subsides over 24 hours. It resolves quickly with antivenom. A few people go on to develop a myotoxicity and associated generalised muscle pain and occasionally weakness, which may last for up to 7 days. Patients may suffer a loss of sense of smell (<a href="anosmia">anosmia</a>); this is unrelated to the severity of the envenoming and can be temporary or permanent. Although the venom contains the <a href="three-finger%20toxin">three-finger toxin</a> α-elapitoxin-Ppr1, which acts as a neurotoxin in laboratory experiments, neurotoxic symptoms are generally absent in clinical cases.

A biologically active agent—pseudexin—was isolated from red-bellied black snake venom in 1981. Making up 25% of the venom, it is a single poly<a href="peptide">peptide</a> chain with a molecular weight of around 16.5 <a href="Atomic_mass_unit%23Usage">kilodaltons</a>. In 1989, it was found to be composed of three <a href="phospholipase%20A2">phospholipase A2</a> isoenzymes. If antivenom is indicated, red-bellied black snake bites are generally treated with <a href="tiger%20snake">tiger snake</a> antivenom. While black snake antivenom can be used, tiger snake antivenom can be used at a lower volume and is a cheaper treatment.

It is the most commonly reported species responsible for envenomed dogs in New South Wales. In 2006, a 12-year-old golden retriever suffered <a href="rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</a> and <a href="acute%20kidney%20injury">acute kidney injury</a> secondary to a red-bellied black snake bite. Laboratory testing has found that cats are relatively resistant to the venom, with a lethal dose as high as 7 mg/kg.

The red-bellied black snake is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Its preferred habitat has been particularly vulnerable to urban development and is highly fragmented, and there has been a widespread decline in frogs, which are its preferred prey. Snake numbers appear to have declined. Feral cats are known to prey on red-bellied black snakes, while young snakes presumably are taken by <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a> ("Dacelo novaeguineae"), <a href="brown%20falcon">brown falcon</a> ("Falco berigora") and other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>.

One of the snakes commonly kept as pets in Australia, the red-bellied black snake adapts readily to captivity and lives on a supply of mice, though it can also survive on fish fillets, chicken, and dog food.

Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)

The Piano Concerto No. 24 in <a href="C%20minor">C minor</a>, <a href="K%C3%B6chel-Verzeichnis">K</a>. 491, is a <a href="concerto">concerto</a> composed by <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> for keyboard (usually a piano or <a href="fortepiano">fortepiano</a>) and orchestra. Mozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after completing his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2023%20%28Mozart%29">Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major</a>. As he intended to perform the work himself, Mozart did not write out the soloist's part in full. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the <a href="Burgtheater%23History">Burgtheater</a> in Vienna. Chronologically, the work is the twentieth of Mozart's <a href="Mozart%20piano%20concertos">23 original piano concertos</a>.

The work is one of only two minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2020%20%28Mozart%29">No. 20 in D minor</a>. None of Mozart's other piano concertos features a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for <a href="string%20section">strings</a>, <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwinds</a>, <a href="horn%20%28instrument%29">horns</a>, <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s and <a href="timpani">timpani</a>. The first of its three <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>, Allegro, is in <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, in <a href="E-flat%20major">E major</a>—the <a href="relative%20major">relative major</a> of C minor—features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, is a <a href="Theme%20and%20variations">theme and eight variations</a> in C minor.

The work is one of Mozart's most advanced compositions in the concerto genre. Its early admirers included <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> and <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a>. Musicologist <a href="Arthur%20Hutchings">Arthur Hutchings</a> declared it to be, taken as a whole, Mozart's greatest piano concerto.

Mozart composed the concerto in the winter of 1785–86, during his fourth season in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. It was the third in a set of three concertos composed in quick succession, the others being <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2022%20%28Mozart%29">No. 22 in E major</a> and <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2023%20%28Mozart%29">No. 23 in A major</a>. Mozart finished composing the No. 24 shortly before the premiere of his comic opera "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>"; the two works are assigned adjacent numbers of 491 and 492 in the <a href="K%C3%B6chel%20catalogue">Köchel catalogue</a>. Although composed at the same time, the two works contrast greatly: the opera is almost entirely in major keys while the concerto is one of Mozart's few minor-key works. The pianist and musicologist <a href="Robert%20D.%20Levin">Robert D. Levin</a> suggests that the concerto, along with the two concertos that precede it, may have served as an outlet for a darker aspect of Mozart's creativity at the time he was composing the comic opera. 

The premiere of the concerto was on either 3 or 7 April 1786 at the <a href="Burgtheater%23History">Burgtheater</a> in Vienna; Mozart featured as the soloist and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard.

In 1800, Mozart's widow <a href="Constanze%20Mozart">Constanze</a> sold the original score of the work to the publisher <a href="Johann%20Anton%20Andr%C3%A9">Johann Anton André</a> of <a href="Offenbach%20am%20Main">Offenbach am Main</a>. It passed through several private hands during the nineteenth century before Sir George Donaldson, a Scottish philanthropist, donated it to the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> in 1894. The College still houses the manuscript today. The original score contains no <a href="tempo">tempo</a> markings; the tempo for each movement is known only from the entries Mozart made into his catalogue. The orchestral parts in the original score are written in a clear manner. The solo part, on the other hand, is often incomplete: on many occasions in the score Mozart notated only the outer parts of passages of <a href="scale%20%28music%29">scales</a> or broken chords. This suggests that Mozart <a href="Musical%20improvisation">improvised</a> much of the solo part when performing the work. The score also contains late additions, including that of the second subject of the first movement's orchestral exposition. There is the occasional notation error in the score, which musicologist <a href="Friedrich%20Blume">Friedrich Blume</a> attributed to Mozart having "obviously written in great haste and under internal strain".

The concerto is divided into the following three <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>:

The concerto is scored for one <a href="western%20concert%20flute">flute</a>, two <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s, two <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s, two <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s, two <a href="natural%20horn">horns</a>, two <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s, <a href="timpani">timpani</a> and <a href="string%20section">strings</a>. This is the largest array of instruments for which Mozart composed any of his concertos.

It is one of only two of Mozart's piano concertos that are scored for both oboes and clarinets (the other, <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2010%20%28Mozart%29">his concerto for two pianos</a>, has clarinets only in the revised version). The clarinet was not at the time a conventional orchestral instrument. Robert D. Levin writes: "The richness of wind sonority, due to the inclusion of oboes and clarinets, is the central timbral characteristic of [the concerto]: time and again in all three movements the winds push the strings completely to the side."

The solo instrument for the concerto is scored as a "cembalo". This term often denotes a <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, but in this concerto, Mozart used it as a generic term that encompassed the <a href="fortepiano">fortepiano</a>, an eighteenth-century version of the modern piano that among other things was more dynamically capable than the harpsichord.

The first movement is longer and more complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre. It is in <a href="3/4%20time"></a>; among Mozart's 27 piano concertos, <a href="K.%2041">No. 4 in G Major</a>, <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2011%20%28Mozart%29">No. 11 in F major</a> and <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2014%20%28Mozart%29">No. 14 in E major</a> are the only others to commence in triple metre.

The first movement follows the standard outline of a <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> concerto movement of the <a href="Classical%20period%20%28music%29">Classical period</a>. It begins with an orchestral <a href="exposition%20%28music%29">exposition</a>, which is followed by a solo exposition, a <a href="development%20%28music%29">development</a> section, a <a href="recapitulation%20%28music%29">recapitulation</a>, a <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a> and a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>. Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.

The orchestral <a href="Exposition%20%28music%29">exposition</a>, 99 <a href="bar%20%28music%29">measures</a> long, presents two groups of <a href="Theme%20%28music%29">thematic material</a>, one primary and one secondary, both in the <a href="Tonic%20%28music%29">tonic</a> of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme <a href="Unison%23%26quot%3BIn%20unison%26quot%3B">in unison</a>, but not powerfully: the <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamic</a> marking is "piano". The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of <a href="C%20minor">C minor</a> until its final <a href="cadence%20%28music%29">cadence</a> in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly <a href="Diatonic%20and%20chromatic">chromatic</a>: in its 13 measures, it utilises all 12 notes of the <a href="chromatic%20scale">chromatic scale</a>.

</score>

The solo exposition follows its orchestral counterpart, and it is here that convention is discarded from the outset: the piano does not enter with the principal theme. Instead, it has an 18-measure solo passage. It is only after this passage that the principal theme appears, carried by the orchestra. The piano then picks up the theme from its seventh measure. Another departure from convention is that the solo exposition does not re-state the secondary theme from the orchestral exposition. Instead, a succession of new secondary thematic material appears. Musicologist <a href="Donald%20Tovey">Donald Tovey</a> considered this introduction of new material to be "utterly subversive of the doctrine that the function of the opening <a href="tutti">tutti</a> [the orchestral exposition] was to predict what the solo had to say."

One hundred measures into the solo exposition, which is now in the relative major of E, the piano plays a <a href="Cadence%20%28music%29%23Classical%20cadential%20trill">cadential trill</a>, leading the orchestra from the <a href="dominant%20seventh%20chord">dominant seventh</a> to the tonic. This suggests to the listener that the solo exposition has reached an end, but Mozart instead gives the <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwinds</a> a new theme. The exposition continues for another 60 or so measures, before another cadential trill brings about the real conclusion, prompting a <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a> that connects the exposition with the development. The pianist and musicologist <a href="Charles%20Rosen">Charles Rosen</a> argues that Mozart thus created a "double exposition". Rosen also suggests that this explains why Mozart made substantial elongations to the orchestral exposition during the composition process; he needed a longer orchestral exposition to balance its "double" solo counterpart.

The <a href="Development%20%28music%29">development</a> begins with the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, this time in the relative major of E. The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2020%20%28Mozart%29">Concerto No. 20</a> is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material. In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>, with its <a href="half%20cadence">half cadence</a>, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question. The final question is asked in C minor and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme.

The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the <a href="circle%20of%20fifths">circle of fifths</a>, accompanied by an elaborate piano <a href="Figure%20%28music%29">figuration</a>. After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar <a href="Cuthbert%20Girdlestone">Cuthbert Girdlestone</a> describes as "one of the few [occasions] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained", and which Tovey describes as a passage of "fine, severe massiveness". The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of <a href="sixteenth%20note">sixteenth note</a>s, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme. This transitional passage ultimately <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulates</a> to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the <a href="Recapitulation%20%28music%29">recapitulation</a> with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.

The wide range of thematic material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form, contain few <a href="Virtuoso">virtuosic</a> moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, which has not been heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of <a href="tuplet">triplets</a> from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing <a href="Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a>. The ritornello in turn leads into a <a href="fermata">fermata</a> that prompts the soloist's <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a>.

Mozart did not write down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no evidence of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a>, <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> and <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.

The conventional Mozartian coda concludes with an orchestral <a href="tutti">tutti</a> and no written-out part for the soloist. In this movement, Mozart breaks with convention: the soloist interrupts the tutti with a virtuosic passage of sixteenth notes and accompanies the orchestra through to the final "pianissimo" C-minor chords.

<a href="Alfred%20Einstein">Alfred Einstein</a> said of the concerto's second movement that it "moves in regions of the purest and most moving tranquility, and has a transcendent simplicity of expression". Marked "Larghetto", the movement is in E major and <a href="alla%20breve">cut common time</a>. The trumpets and timpani play no part; they return for the third movement.

The movement opens with the soloist playing the four-measure principal theme alone; it is then repeated by the orchestra.

</score>

This theme is, in the words of <a href="Michael%20Steinberg%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Steinberg</a>, one of "extreme simplicity". <a href="Donald%20Tovey">Donald Tovey</a> refers to the fourth bar, extremely bare and lacking any ornamentation, as "naive", but considers that Mozart intended for it to be so. Mozart's first sketch of the movement was much more complex. He likely simplified the theme to provide a greater contrast with the dark intensity of the first movement. After the orchestra repeats the principal theme, there is a very simple <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> or transitional passage that Girdlestone calls "but a sketch" to be ornamented by the soloist, arguing that "to play it as printed is to betray the memory of Mozart".

Following the bridge passage, the soloist plays the initial four-measure theme for a second time, before the orchestra commences a new section of the movement, in C minor. A brief return of the principal theme, its rhythm altered, separates the C minor section from a section in <a href="A-flat%20major">A major</a>. After this new section, the principal theme returns to mark the end of the movement, its rhythm altered yet again. Now, the theme is played twice by the soloist, the two appearances being connected by the same simple bridge passage from the beginning of the movement. Girdlestone argues that here "the soloist will have to draw on his imagination to adorn [the simple bridge passage] a second time". The overall structure of the movement is thus ABACA, making the movement in <a href="Rondo%23form">rondo form</a>.

In the middle statement of the principal theme (between the C minor and A major sections), there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. <a href="Alfred%20Brendel">Alfred Brendel</a>, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.

The form of the movement is nearly identical to that of the second movement of Mozart's <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2017%20%28Mozart%29">Piano Sonata in B major, K. 570</a>.

The third movement features a <a href="Theme%20%28music%29">theme</a> in C minor followed by eight <a href="Variation%20%28music%29">variations</a> upon it. Hutchings considered it "both Mozart's finest essay in variation form and also his best concerto finale."

</score>

The tempo marking for the movement is "Allegretto". Rosen opines that this calls for a <a href="march%20%28music%29">march</a>-like speed and argues that the movement is "generally taken too fast under the delusion that a quick tempo will give it a power commensurate with that of the opening movement." Pianist <a href="Angela%20Hewitt">Angela Hewitt</a> sees in the movement not a march but a "sinister dance".

The movement opens with the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure <a href="Phrase%20%28music%20theory%29">phrases</a>, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the <a href="Dominant%20%28music%29">dominant</a>, G minor; the second phrase <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulates</a> back to C minor. The soloist does not play any part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment.

Variations II to VI are what Girdlestone and Hutchings independently describe as "double" variations. Within each variation, each of the eight-measure phrases from the theme is further varied upon its repeat (AABB). Variations IV and VI are in major keys. Tovey refers to the former (in A) as "cheerful" and the latter (in C) as "graceful". Between the two major-key variations, Variation V returns to C minor; Girdlestone describes this variation as "one of the most moving". Variation VII is half the length of the preceding variations, as it omits the repeat of each eight-measure phrase. This variation concludes with an extra three-measure passage that culminates in a <a href="dominant%20chord">dominant chord</a>, announcing the arrival of a <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a>.

After the cadenza, the soloist opens the eighth and final variation alone, with the orchestra joining after 19 measures. The arrival of the final variation also brings a change in metre: from <a href="cut%20common%20time">cut common time</a> to <a href="Compound%20time">compound</a> <a href="duple%20time">duple time</a>. Both the final variation and the <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> which follows contain numerous <a href="Neapolitan%20chord">neapolitan-sixth</a> chords. Girdlestone referred to the "haunting" effect of these chords and stated that the coda ultimately "proclaims with desperation the triumph of the minor mode".

<a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> admired the concerto and it may have influenced his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Piano Concerto No. 3</a>, also in C minor. After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked to a colleague that "[w]e shall never be able to do anything like that." <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a> also admired the concerto, encouraging <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a> to play it, and wrote his own <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a> for the first movement. Brahms referred to the work as a "masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas."

Among modern and twentieth-century scholars, <a href="Cuthbert%20Girdlestone">Cuthbert Girdlestone</a> states that the concerto "is in all respects one of [Mozart's] greatest; we would fain say: "the" greatest, were it not impossible to choose between four or five of them." Referring to the "dark, tragic and passionate" nature of the concerto, <a href="Alfred%20Einstein">Alfred Einstein</a> states that "it is hard to imagine the expression on the faces of the Viennese public" when Mozart premiered the work. The musicologist <a href="Simon%20P.%20Keefe">Simon P. Keefe</a>, in an exegesis of all of Mozart's piano concertos, writes that the No. 24 is "a climactic and culminating work in Mozart's piano concerto "oeuvre", firmly linked to its predecessors, yet decisively transcending them at the same time." The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is "not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed". <a href="Arthur%20Hutchings">Arthur Hutchings</a>'s view is that "whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'."

The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" included it on their <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> at 484. It won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="2004%20Grammy%20Awards">2004 ceremony</a>.

Filmmaker <a href="Francis%20Lawrence">Francis Lawrence</a> directed the music video for "Cry Me a River" in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a <a href="publicity%20stunt">publicity stunt</a>, but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for <a href="Best%20Male%20Video">Best Male Video</a> and <a href="Best%20Pop%20Video">Best Pop Video</a> at the <a href="2003%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2003 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" on his four major concert tours: <a href="The%20Justified%20World%20Tour">The Justified World Tour</a> (2003–04), <a href="Justified%20and%20Stripped%20Tour">Justified and Stripped Tour</a> (2003), <a href="FutureSex/LoveShow">FutureSex/LoveShow</a> (2007), and <a href="The%2020/20%20Experience%20World%20Tour">The 20/20 Experience World Tour</a> (2013–15).

Timberlake and <a href="Scott%20Storch">Scott Storch</a> wrote "Cry Me a River" with <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, who produced the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>, "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with a couple of things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written "Cry Me a River" after an argument with Spears: "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry." Timbaland recalled, "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth.'"

"Cry Me a River" was recorded at <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Recording Studios</a> in Los Angeles by Senator Jimmy D, while Carlos "Storm" Martinez served as the assistant engineer. <a href="Jimmy%20Douglass">Jimmy Douglass</a> and Timbaland <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> the song at <a href="Manhattan%20Center">Manhattan Center Studios</a> in New York City. Timberlake arranged the vocals and was a backup singer alongside Timbaland, <a href="Marsha%20Ambrosius">Marsha Ambrosius</a>, <a href="Tye%20Tribbett">Tye Tribbett</a> and Greater Anointing. Storch compared Timberlake's vocals on "Cry Me a River" to <a href="R%26amp%3BB%20music">R&B</a> and rock singer <a href="Daryl%20Hall">Daryl Hall</a>. Larry Gold provided the <a href="string%20%28music%29">string</a> <a href="Arrangement%20%28music%29">arrangement</a> and <a href="conducting">conducting</a>, while Storch and Bill Pettaway played the <a href="clavinet">clavinet</a> and guitar, respectively.

"Cry Me a River" was released as the second single from "<a href="Justified%20%28album%29">Justified</a>". <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> serviced the song to <a href="Contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary</a> and <a href="Rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic radio</a> in the United States on November 25, 2002.

It was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> in Germany on January 23. The single contains the album version of the song and the remixes on its 12-inch single release. A CD single, which included Johnny Fiasco's remix of the song and two additional remixes of "Like I Love You", was released on February 3 and 6 in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively. "Cry Me a River" was released as a CD single in the US on February 18. The single features the album version of the song, its <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> and four remixes.

Following its release, there was media speculation that Spears had written a song as a response to "Cry Me a River"; she denied the rumors, explaining, "You know, it's funny. I read that I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. I would never do that." <a href="Annet%20Artani">Annet Artani</a>, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song "<a href="Everytime">Everytime</a>", stated that the song was written as a response to "Cry Me a River". When asked during an interview with <a href="Diane%20Sawyer">Diane Sawyer</a> on "<a href="Primetime%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">PrimeTime</a>" in 2003, if "Everytime" was about Timberlake, Spears responded, "I'll let the song speak for itself."

"Cry Me a River" is an <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song with an <a href="Instrumentation%20%28music%29">instrumentation</a> that features clavinet, guitars, <a href="beatboxing">beatboxing</a>, <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, <a href="Arabic%20music">Arabian</a>-inspired <a href="riffs">riffs</a> and <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>s. The instruments are arranged into what critics described as a graceful and mysterious melody. Jane Stevenson of "<a href="Jam%21">Jam!</a>" said the single combines <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> and <a href="opera">opera</a>. Tyler Martin of <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a> enjoyed the way that the song unconventionally mixed a range of experimental sounds. According to Martin, the <a href="Wave%20Music">wave</a> synth affects the real <a href="Strings%20%28music%29">strings</a> to create an unusual <a href="consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>. The song's chorus devolves into a choral reading in which Timberlake pleads over the group. "Cry Me a River" finishes with a Timbaland vocal sample.

"Cry Me a River" is written in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="G-sharp%20minor">G minor</a>, in "<a href="alla%20breve">alla breve</a>", with a <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 74 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The song's vocal range spans from <a href="C%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a> to <a href="B%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a>. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine critics called "Cry Me a River" a bittersweet song, in which Timberlake's "familiar <a href="tenor">tenor</a> belting" is tempered with a soulful <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> and a "convincingly aggressive rock-spiked <a href="baritone">baritone</a>" rasp. <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" labeled the song "a haunted, pained farewell".

Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" reviewer called the song a "breakup <a href="aria">aria</a>". According to Caroline Sullivan of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", "Cry Me a River" stands out for its "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his "husky best". The song begins with the phrase "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." The chorus contains the lines: "Told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"'s Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single "<a href="What%20Goes%20Around...%20Comes%20Around">What Goes Around... Comes Around</a>" an ostensible sequel to "Cry Me a River" both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between "Cry Me a River" and Timberlake's 2013 single "<a href="Mirrors%20%28Justin%20Timberlake%20song%29">Mirrors</a>" is clear: "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".

"Cry Me a River" received acclaim from critics. Jane Stevenson of Jam! and Sal Cinquemani of "Slant Magazine" regarded it as a stand-out track from "Justified". <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> selected the song as a highlight in his review of "Justified". Peter Robinson of "NME" called it a "twisted epic" and "an acidic, filthy little song teeming with spite and retribution, with Timbaland's pounding." "Rolling Stone"s Ben Ratliff viewed his production of "Cry Me a River" as exceptional. Denise Boyd of <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a> felt that the song's lyrics play as large a role as Timbaland's production, unlike other songs on "Justified". David Browne of "Entertainment Weekly" concluded that the song is "a genuine stunner" that should leave Timberlake's fellow 'N Syncers concerned that he truly may not need them any more. John Mitchell of MTV News called "Cry Me a River" and "What Goes Around... Comes Around" "kiss-off songs", with Timberlake's revenge on Spears present throughout the lyrics. <a href="Idolator%20%28website%29">Idolator</a> staff opined it is the sound of an artist who is "relishing ripping up people's perceptions of him as a sweet-natured teen heartthrob." <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s Emily Exton wrote, "By stretching the boundaries of pop–and fusing it with notes of R&B, lots of electric goodness, and haunting choral vocals–Timberlake’s kiss-off song instantly becomes more poignant, a pointed reaction to the hurt he’s experienced by someone he once loved." According to "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>", the song "made people completely forget about 'N Sync and start asking what Timberlake would do next." The single won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="2004%20Grammy%20Awards">2004 award ceremony</a>. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the <a href="2003%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">2003 MTV Europe Music Awards</a>.

For "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>" it was the 3rd best song of 2003. "Rolling Stone" ranked "Cry Me a River" at number 20 on their list of the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s; a columnist for the magazine wrote that the real inspiration behind the song was the formation of the Timberlake–Timbaland team, "a match made in pop heaven". In 2012, the magazine placed it at number 484 on their list of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>". <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked "Cry Me a River" at number 59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" listed the song at number 40 on the "100 songs that defined the Noughties."

Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, "[Justin and I] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a <a href="voyeur">voyeur</a> and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with <a href="%27N%20Sync">'N Sync</a> and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." The music video for "Cry Me a River" was released onto the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> on April 28, 2003.
The video begins with a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking out of her house hand-in-hand with an unidentified man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W220">Mercedes 500 W220</a>, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice in the back of the car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.
Peter Robinson of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" wrote that the video shows "what Justin looks like after he's had sex. Clue: he looks pretty good." According to <a href="Virginia%20Heffernan">Virginia Heffernan</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Timberlake channels the character Neo from "<a href="The%20Matrix%20%28franchise%29">The Matrix</a>" film series, "pacing anxiously around wet and metallic interiors". At the <a href="2003%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2003 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, the video for "Cry Me a River" won in the categories of <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Video">Best Male Video</a> and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Video">Best Pop Video</a>. It had also been nominated for <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a>, <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction">Best Direction in a Video</a> and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Viewer%27s%20Choice">Viewer's Choice</a>.

Following the release of the music video, "<a href="Us%20Weekly">Us Weekly</a>" ran a cover story titled "Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On". Timberlake denied that Spears inspired the video, saying, "The video is not about her. The video is about me." However, Spears told "Rolling Stone" in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her would be in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, "Well, I got a controversial video." She stated that it was a great <a href="publicity%20stunt">publicity stunt</a>, commenting, "So he got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally." After the release of Spears' video for "<a href="Toxic%20%28song%29">Toxic</a>" (2003), Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News said her video "[made] "Cry Me a River" look like child's play".

In 2013, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" editor Jason Lipshutz opined the clip was "one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century. The visual is JT's most controversial music video to date." He added, "The "Cry Me a River" video served a dual purpose for Timberlake: to court controversy, and to make its star seem more grown-up." In 2018, "Billboard" critics named it the 24th "greatest music video of the 21st century."

Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" for the first time at the 13th annual <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Award">"Billboard" Music Awards</a>, held on December 9, 2002, at the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Garden%20Arena">MGM Grand Garden Arena</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>. He was accompanied by a string section and a 20-member choir. He also performed the song on the <a href="Justified%20World%20Tour">Justified World Tour</a> (2003–04), his first worldwide tour. The song was eighth on the <a href="set%20list">set list</a> of <a href="Justified/Stripped%20Tour">Justified/Stripped Tour</a> (2003), his joint North American tour with <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>.

He performed a <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>-inspired version of the song on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" on October 11, 2003; and it was fourteenth on the set list of his second worldwide tour, <a href="FutureSex/LoveShow">FutureSex/LoveShow</a> (2007).

On October 23, 2010, while performing at the annual charity gig "Justin Timberlake and Friends" in Las Vegas, Timberlake began the show with a slow and "sultry" performance of "Cry Me a River" and segued into a cover of <a href="Bill%20Withers">Bill Withers</a>' 1971 single "<a href="Ain%27t%20No%20Sunshine">Ain't No Sunshine</a>". He later resumed "Cry Me a River" before segueing into a cover of <a href="Drake%20%28entertainer%29">Drake</a>'s 2010 song "<a href="Over%20%28Drake%20song%29">Over</a>". Jillian Mapes of "Billboard" described the performance as "completely lovely in an effortless sort of way." Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" at concert he held during the <a href="2013%20Super%20Bowl">2013 Super Bowl</a> weekend in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" in a medley with other of his songs at the <a href="2013%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2013 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. After the performance he accepted a <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20Video%20Vanguard%20Award">Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award</a> at the ceremony. Timberlake included the single on the set list of his fifth worldwide concert tour, <a href="The%2020/20%20Experience%20World%20Tour">The 20/20 Experience World Tour</a> (2013–15).

The song was first covered by <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="alternative%20metal">alternative metal</a> band <a href="Lostprophets">Lostprophets</a>, recorded in a BBC Radio One session. It appears as a b-side of the single <a href="Last%20Train%20Home%20%28Lostprophets%20song%29">Last Train Home</a>, released in 2004. American singer-songwriter <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a> performed a cover of "Cry Me a River" in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, during the <a href="Speak%20Now%20World%20Tour">Speak Now World Tour</a> (2011–12). <a href="Justin%20Bieber">Justin Bieber</a> recorded a cover of the song together with <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>'s 2007 single "<a href="Stronger%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29">Stronger</a>", which he posted on his <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> account.

CSI effect

The CSI effect, also known as the CSI syndrome and the CSI infection, is any of several ways in which the exaggerated portrayal of <a href="forensic%20science">forensic science</a> on crime television shows such as "" influences public perception. The term was first reported in a 2004 "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" article describing the effect being made on trial jurors by television programs featuring forensic science. It most often refers to the belief that <a href="Jury">jurors</a> have come to demand more <a href="forensic%20evidence">forensic evidence</a> in <a href="criminal%20trial">criminal trial</a>s, thereby raising the effective <a href="standard%20of%20proof">standard of proof</a> for <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a>s. While this belief is widely held among American legal professionals, some studies have suggested that crime shows are unlikely to cause such an effect, although frequent "CSI" viewers may place a lower value on <a href="circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial evidence</a>. As technology improves and becomes more prevalent throughout society, people may also develop higher expectations for the capabilities of forensic technology.

The CSI effect is named for "", a television program which first aired in 2000. In "CSI", a fictional team of crime scene investigators solve murders in the <a href="Las%20Vegas%20metropolitan%20area">Las Vegas metropolitan area</a>. In each episode, the discovery of a human corpse leads to a criminal investigation by members of the team, who gather and analyze forensic evidence, question witnesses, and apprehend suspects. The show's popularity led to three <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-offs</a>: "", which debuted in 2002, "", first aired in 2004, and "", which premiered in 2015.

The "CSI" franchise's success resulted in the production of many similar shows. The "CSI effect" has been associated with <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama</a> and <a href="true%20crime">true crime</a> television series that preceded "CSI", such as "<a href="American%20Justice">American Justice</a>", "<a href="Cold%20Case%20Files">Cold Case Files</a>", "<a href="Cold%20Squad">Cold Squad</a>", "", "<a href="Forensic%20Files">Forensic Files</a>", "<a href="Silent%20Witness">Silent Witness</a>", "<a href="Waking%20the%20Dead%20%28TV%20series%29">Waking the Dead</a>"; and others that followed, including "<a href="Bones%20%28TV%20series%29">Bones</a>", "<a href="Cold%20Case">Cold Case</a>", "<a href="Criminal%20Minds">Criminal Minds</a>", "<a href="Crossing%20Jordan">Crossing Jordan</a>", "<a href="NCIS%20%28TV%20series%29">NCIS</a>", "<a href="Numb3rs">Numb3rs</a>", "<a href="Wire%20in%20the%20Blood">Wire in the Blood</a>", and "<a href="Without%20a%20Trace">Without a Trace</a>". Based on the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, six of the top ten most popular television shows in the United States in 2005 were crime dramas, and "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" reached the number one ranking in November 2007.

Several aspects of popular crime shows have been criticized as being unrealistic. For instance, the show's characters not only investigate ("process") crime scenes, but they also conduct raids, engage in suspect pursuit and arrest, interrogate suspects, and solve cases, which falls under the responsibility of uniformed officers and detectives, not CSI personnel. Additionally, if CSIs process a crime scene it is inappropriate for them to also be involved in the examination and testing of any evidence collected from that scene as it would compromise the impartiality of scientific evidence. In real investigations, <a href="DNA%20profiling">DNA</a> and <a href="fingerprint">fingerprint</a> data are often unobtainable and, when they are available, can take several weeks or months to process, whereas television <a href="crime%20lab">crime lab</a>s usually get results within hours. In the first season of "CSI", technicians made a <a href="plaster%20cast">plaster mold</a> of the interior of a wound to determine the type of knife used to make the wound, which is not possible with current technology. Characters on television often use the word "match" to describe a definitive relationship between two pieces of evidence, whereas real forensic technicians tend to use terms that are less definite, which acknowledges that absolute certainty is often not possible.

<a href="Anthony%20E.%20Zuiker">Anthony E. Zuiker</a>, creator of the "<a href="CSI%20%28franchise%29">CSI</a>" franchise, claimed that "all of the science is accurate" on the shows; researchers, however, have described "CSI" portrayal of forensic science as "high-tech magic." Forensic scientist Thomas Mauriello estimated that 40 percent of the scientific techniques depicted on "CSI" do not exist. In addition to using unrealistic techniques, "CSI" ignores all elements of uncertainty present in real investigations, and instead portrays experimental results as absolute truth.

The notion that these inaccurate portrayals could alter the public perception of forensic evidence was dubbed the "CSI effect", a term which began to appear in mainstream media as early as 2004.

Under this effect, victims and their families – and jurors – are coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a "smoking gun" for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of "CSI" on jury members.

By 2009, more than 250 stories about the CSI effect had appeared in newspapers and magazines, including articles in "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>", "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>", and "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>".

Although the CSI effect is a recent phenomenon, it has long been recognized that media portrayals of the <a href="United%20States%20legal%20system">United States legal system</a> are capable of significantly altering public awareness, knowledge, and opinions of it. A 2002 juror survey showed that viewers of the popular court show "<a href="Judge%20Judy">Judge Judy</a>" were greatly misinformed about the purpose of the <a href="judge">judge</a> within a <a href="courtroom">courtroom</a>. Earlier programs which may have affected public perception of "the legal or investigative systems" include "<a href="Perry%20Mason%20%28TV%20series%29">Perry Mason</a>" (1957–66), "<a href="Quincy%2C%20M.E.">Quincy, M.E.</a>" (1976–83) and the <a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order%20%28franchise%29">"Law & Order" franchise</a> (1990–present). <a href="News%20media">News media</a> reports on criminal trials, extensive internet <a href="blog">blog</a>ging, and the successes of the <a href="Innocence%20Project">Innocence Project</a> have also contributed to the increased public awareness of forensic science. Zuiker has stated that The CSI Effect' is, in my opinion, the most amazing thing that has ever come out of the series."

The "CSI" effect is described by researchers N.J. Schweiter and <a href="Michael%20J.%20Saks">Michael J. Saks</a> as a reference to the alleged phenomenon of "CSI" raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of <a href="forensic%20science">forensic science</a>, especially <a href="Forensic%20science">crime scene investigation</a> and <a href="DNA%20testing">DNA testing</a>. Donald E. Shelton, Young S. Kim and Gregg Barak have said it has changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court.

In 2006, the evidence cited in support of the supposed effect was mainly anecdotes from law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, and allegedly little empirical examination of the effect had been done, and the one study published by then suggested the phenomenon may be an urban myth. A survey conducted by Donald E. Shelton on 1,027 potential jurors in Ann Arbor, Michigan revealed that while "CSI" viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence than non-"CSI" viewers, in most cases, scientific evidence was not needed in order to reach a verdict.

However, more recent research suggests that these modern TV shows do have a misleading influence on public perceptions and expectations, and juror behavior.

Citing the "CSI Effect," at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs

The popularity of forensic crime television shows supposedly gives rise to many misconceptions about the nature of forensic science and investigation procedures among jury members. The CSI effect is hypothesized to affect verdicts in two main ways: first, that jurors expect more forensic evidence than is available or necessary, resulting in a higher rate of <a href="acquittal">acquittal</a> when such evidence is absent; and second, that jurors have greater confidence in forensic and particularly DNA evidence than is warranted, resulting in a higher rate of <a href="conviction">conviction</a> when such evidence is present. While these and other effects may be caused by crime shows, the most commonly reported effect is that jurors are wrongly acquitting defendants despite overwhelming evidence of guilt. In particular, <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a>s have reported feeling pressured to provide DNA evidence even when <a href="eyewitness%20testimony">eyewitness testimony</a> is available. In one highly publicized incident, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles County, California</a> <a href="District%20Attorney">District Attorney</a> <a href="Steve%20Cooley">Steve Cooley</a> blamed actor <a href="Robert%20Blake%20%28actor%29">Robert Blake</a>'s acquittal on murder charges on the CSI effect. Cooley noted that the not guilty verdict came despite two witness accounts of Blake's guilt, and claimed that the jury members were "incredibly stupid".

By 2005, some prosecutors had begun altering their trial preparations and procedures in an attempt to counter the CSI effect. Some ask questions about forensic television viewership during "<a href="voir%20dire">voir dire</a>" to target biased jurors; others use <a href="opening%20statement">opening statement</a>s and <a href="closing%20argument">closing argument</a>s to minimize the possible impact of the CSI effect, and instruct jurors to adhere to the court's standards of evidence rather than those seen on television. Prosecutors have even hired <a href="expert%20witness">expert witness</a>es to explain why particular forms of physical evidence are not relevant to their cases. In one Australian murder case, the defense counsel requested a <a href="judge-only%20trial">judge-only trial</a> to avoid having DNA evidence misinterpreted by a jury. By 2006, the CSI effect had become widely accepted as reality among legal professionals, despite little <a href="empirical%20research">empirical evidence</a> to validate or disprove it. A 2008 survey by researcher Monica Robbers showed that roughly 80 percent of all American legal professionals believed they had had <a href="judgment%20%28law%29">decisions</a> affected by forensic television programs.

<a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> professor Tom R. Tyler argued that, from a psychological standpoint, crime shows are more likely to increase the rate of convictions than acquittals, as the shows promote a sense of justice and closure which is not attained when a jury acquits a defendant. The perceived rise in the rate of acquittals may be related to sympathy for the defendant or declining confidence in legal authorities. A 2006 survey of U.S. university students reached a similar conclusion: the influence of "CSI" is unlikely to burden prosecutors, and may actually help them.

One of the largest empirical studies of the CSI effect was undertaken in 2006 by <a href="Washtenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Washtenaw County</a> Circuit Court Judge Donald Shelton and two researchers from <a href="Eastern%20Michigan%20University">Eastern Michigan University</a>. They surveyed more than 1,000 jurors, and found that while juror expectations for forensic evidence had increased, there was no correlation between viewership of crime shows and tendency to convict. One alternate explanation for the changing perception of forensic evidence is the so-called "tech effect": as technology improves and becomes more prevalent throughout society, people develop higher expectations for the capabilities of forensic technology. Shelton described one instance in which a jury member complained because the prosecution had not <a href="fingerprint%20powder">dusted</a> the lawn for fingerprints, a procedure which is impossible and had not been demonstrated on any crime show. A later study by the same authors found that frequent "CSI" viewers may place a lower value on <a href="circumstantial%20evidence">circumstantial evidence</a>, but their viewership had no influence on their evaluation of eyewitness testimony or their tendency to convict in cases with multiple types of evidence.

Many stories about the CSI effect assume that there has been an increase in acquittal rates, though this is often based entirely on <a href="anecdotal%20evidence">anecdotal evidence</a>. A 2009 study of conviction statistics in eight states found that, contrary to the opinions of criminal prosecutors, the acquittal rate has decreased in the years since the debut of "CSI". The outcome of any given trial is much more strongly dependent on the state in which it took place, rather than whether it occurred before or after the "CSI" premiere. A 2010 study by the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Milwaukee">University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee</a> suggests that, while there may be a correlation between crime show viewership and a perceived understanding of DNA evidence, there was no evidence that such viewership affected jury decision making. As of August 2010, no empirical evidence has demonstrated a correlation between "CSI" viewership and acquittal rates. One researcher suggested that the perception of a CSI effect—and of other courtroom effects, such as <a href="Perry%20Mason%20syndrome">Perry Mason syndrome</a> and white coat syndrome—is caused not by the incompetence of jury members, but by a general distrust of the jury system as a whole.

The CSI effect has influenced the manner in which forensic scientists are educated and trained. In the past, those who sought to enter the field of forensics typically earned an <a href="undergraduate%20degree">undergraduate degree</a> in a science, followed by a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a>. However, the popularity of programs such as "CSI" has caused an increase in the demand for undergraduate courses and graduate programs in forensic science. In 2004, the forensics programs at <a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, doubled in size, reportedly as a result of the CSI effect. However, many students enter such programs with unrealistic expectations. Vocational interest in forensic science has proliferated among students in countries besides the United States, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The increased popularity of the forensic science program at the <a href="University%20of%20Lausanne">University of Lausanne</a> in Switzerland has also been attributed to the CSI effect.

Although the increased popularity of forensics programs means there are more applicants for jobs at crime labs, there is some concern that these courses do not adequately prepare students for real forensics work, as graduates often lack a firm grasp of basic scientific principles that would come from a science degree. Many forensics students are presented with streamlined exercises with overly clear answers, which may give them distorted perceptions of the power of forensic science. The <a href="Albuquerque%20Police%20Department">Albuquerque Police Department</a> has attempted to improve <a href="scientific%20literacy">scientific literacy</a> among future forensic scientists and jurors alike by developing a "Citizen CSI" course which familiarizes local citizens with the "capabilities and limitations of authentic forensic science techniques."

While forensic crime shows are often criticized for portraying technologies that do not exist, these may inspire inventors and research teams, as it is not uncommon for scientific innovations to be first portrayed in science fiction.

The CSI effect may also alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, the year that "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" debuted, 46.9 percent of all <a href="rape">rape</a> cases in the United States were resolved by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often inadvertently explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them to shower or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in <a href="Trumbull%20County%2C%20Ohio">Trumbull County</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, where he murdered two women. A fan of "CSI", McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: he cleaned his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted to dispose of the murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County">Los Angeles County</a> homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even "encourage them when they see how simple it is to get away with [it] on television."

Others argue that shows like "CSI" are not having any educational effect on criminals. Max Houck, director of the Forensic Science Initiative at <a href="West%20Virginia%20University">West Virginia University</a>, said although "CSI" may be educating criminals, people who resort to a life of crime generally are not very intelligent to begin with. It is also possible that crime shows have the opposite effect, if attempts to conceal evidence generate more evidence. Houck gave an example of criminals who avoided licking envelopes because of the DNA in their saliva, but left fingerprints and hair samples on adhesive tape instead. Tammy Klein, the lead investigator on the McKinney case, said that the killings she investigates are committed by people "who for the most part are pretty stupid." Larry Pozner, former president of the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Criminal%20Defense%20Lawyers">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a>, argued that because people who commit violent crimes generally do not take precautions, television forensics programs are unlikely to have any effect on their behavior.

Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes forced his victims to destroy forensic evidence. He was only caught after one of his victims deliberately pulled out her own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him to the attacks. She was inspired by watching the "CSI" television series.

Law enforcement officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most saw them as opportunities to inform the public about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving <a href="Cold%20case%20%28criminology%29">cold cases</a> and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.

Bernard Fanning

Bernard Fanning (born 15 August 1969) is an Australian musician and singer-songwriter. He is best known as the <a href="lead%20singer">lead singer</a> and frontman of Queensland <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> <a href="rock%20band">band</a> <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a> from its formation in 1989 to its dissolution in 2010.

Born and raised in <a href="Toowong">Toowong</a>, Brisbane, Fanning was taught the piano by his mother at an early age. At the age of 12, while attending <a href="St%20Joseph%27s%20College%2C%20Gregory%20Terrace">St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace</a>, he began writing music, and upon graduating from St. Joseph's, moved on to the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland">University of Queensland</a>, where he studied journalism for a short time. He dropped out to pursue a music career, after meeting <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a> in an economics class. Fanning joined Haug, <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a>, and <a href="Steven%20Bishop">Steven Bishop</a>, who had recently formed Powderfinger, and took the role of lead singer. After Bishop left and guitarist <a href="Darren%20Middleton">Darren Middleton</a> joined, the band released five <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a>s in fifteen years and achieved mainstream success in Australia. During Powderfinger's hiatus in 2005, Fanning began his solo music career with the studio album "<a href="Tea%20%26amp%3B%20Sympathy%20%28Bernard%20Fanning%20album%29">Tea & Sympathy</a>". Powderfinger then reunited in 2007 and released two more albums before disbanding in late 2010.

While Powderfinger's style focuses on alternative rock, Fanning's solo music is generally described as a mixture of <a href="blues">blues</a> and <a href="acoustic%20folk">acoustic folk</a>. Fanning plays guitar, piano, keyboards and harmonica, both when performing solo and also with Powderfinger. Often speaking out against Australian <a href="Politics%20in%20Australia">political figures</a>, Fanning has donated much of his time to philanthropic causes. He is an advocate for Aboriginal justice in Australia.

Fanning was born in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> on 15 August 1969. He was raised, alongside two brothers and a sister, in an <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> family in the inner Brisbane suburb of <a href="Toowong%2C%20Queensland">Toowong</a>. The death of one of Fanning's brothers to <a href="cancer">cancer</a> would be the inspiration for "<a href="Vulture%20Street%20%28album%29">Vulture Street</a>"'s "<a href="Since%20You%27ve%20Been%20Gone%20%28Powderfinger%20song%29">Since You've Been Gone</a>". Fanning's mother began teaching him to play piano as a young child, although his siblings were not interested in music.

Fanning attended <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20College%2C%20Gregory%20Terrace">St. Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace</a> and began writing his own music at the age of 15. Fanning has described these early works as "terrible", but notes that he enjoyed writing and arranging them. After graduating from St Joseph's, Fanning entered the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland">University of Queensland</a> to study <a href="journalism">journalism</a>; however, he was equally interested in pursuing a music career. He left university at the age of 19 to pursue a music career.

Fanning first met Powderfinger <a href="guitarist">guitarist</a> <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a> in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989. At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a> and <a href="Steven%20Bishop">Steven Bishop</a>, who would become the band's foundational <a href="bass%20guitarist">bass guitarist</a> and <a href="drummer">drummer</a>, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and <a href="lead%20singer">lead singer</a>. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that "It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'"

In 1992, current guitarist <a href="Darren%20Middleton">Darren Middleton</a> was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining <a href="Jon%20Coghill">Jon Coghill</a> who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.

Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry. Fanning was called upon by film-maker <a href="Gregor%20Jordan">Gregor Jordan</a> in 2003 to perform the folk song "Moreton Bay" (named after the <a href="Moreton%20Bay">bay of the same name</a> in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition "Shelter for My Soul" in Jordan's film "<a href="Ned%20Kelly%20%282003%20film%29">Ned Kelly</a>". Fanning then enlisted Jordan to film Powderfinger's first live DVD, "".

On 31 October 2005, Fanning released his debut solo album entitled "<a href="Tea%20%26amp%3B%20Sympathy%20%28Bernard%20Fanning%20album%29">Tea & Sympathy</a>". The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian <a href="ARIA%20Albums%20chart">ARIA Albums chart</a>, and spent 58 weeks in the top 50. It peaked at No. 11 during its 18-week stay on the New Zealand <a href="RIANZ">albums chart</a>.

"Tea & Sympathy" comprised songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new content written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a "creative burst" between March and May 2005. Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend, Philippa Sison. The majority of the album was recorded at <a href="Real%20World%20Studios">Real World Studios</a> with <a href="Tchad%20Blake">Tchad Blake</a> in June 2005, except for "Not Finished Just Yet", "Believe", "Wash Me Clean", and "Hope & Validation", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by musicians <a href="Jerry%20Marotta">Jerry Marotta</a>, <a href="Keith%20Duffy%20%28bassist%29">Keith Duffy</a>, and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, "We had a ball putting the songs together."

Three singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, "<a href="Wish%20You%20Well">Wish You Well</a>", shortly followed by "<a href="Songbird%20%28Bernard%20Fanning%20song%29">Songbird</a>". These releases were only sold as <a href="music%20download">digital download</a> singles. The third single from the album, "<a href="Watch%20Over%20Me%20%28song%29">Watch Over Me</a>", was the only to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at No. 16, and spent eight weeks in the top 50. On 26 January 2006, "Wish You Well" was voted No. 1 for the <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100">Triple J Hottest 100</a>, <a href="Triple%20J%20Hottest%20100%2C%202005">2005</a>. Following "Watch Over Me", Fanning digitally released a fourth single "<a href="Weekend%20of%20Mystery">Weekend of Mystery</a>", which was not officially on the album, except for those who purchased the album from the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>. Fanning also took home the award for Best Music Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for the iconic 'Wish You Well' clip.

On 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide <a href="Which%20Way%20Home%20Concert%20Tour">Which Way Home Concert Tour</a>, named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in all of Australia's major <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20capital%20cities">capital cities</a>. He was supported by <a href="Perth">Perth</a> band <a href="The%20Panics">The Panics</a> and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris. He followed this with the "Yesterday's Gone" tour, announced on 11 August 2006, and concluding with Powderfinger re-uniting and returning to the recording studio— Fanning later stated that while he enjoyed making "Tea & Sympathy", "Powderfinger is my real job".

Throughout 2006, Fanning had hinted towards <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a> ceasing their hiatus to release a sixth studio album. Recorded in Los Angeles, "<a href="Dream%20Days%20at%20the%20Hotel%20Existence">Dream Days at the Hotel Existence</a>" was released on 2 June 2007. The title of the album came from a chapter of "<a href="Brooklyn%20Follies">Brooklyn Follies</a>" by <a href="Paul%20Auster">Paul Auster</a>, a book that Fanning had read during recording. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">ARIA</a> Albums chart.

Powderfinger toured around Australia and New Zealand with <a href="Silverchair">Silverchair</a> on the <a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20tour">Across the Great Divide tour</a> in 2007. The tour's aim was to promote the efforts of <a href="Reconciliation%20Australia">Reconciliation Australia</a> to reduce the 17-year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians. Fanning said of the tour, "The idea is to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation."

After the disbanding of Powderfinger, Fanning moved to Spain with his family where he began writing and recording demos for his next solo album. In January 2013 Fanning announced on his website blog that he had been recording the follow up to 2005's "Tea and Sympathy" in Los Angeles. In March 2013 he announced via his blog that recording had been completed and he had returned to Australia. The album "Departures" was released on 7 June 2013, with the first single "Battleships" released on 22 April.

Fanning released his third studio album "<a href="Civil%20Dusk">Civil Dusk</a>" on 5 August 2016. It was preceded by the single "Wasting Time".

Fanning has been described as having a strong vocal range when singing, but has stated that he is not highly confident in his voice. In a 1998 interview, Fanning said, "I don't think I have the perfect voice or anything", and stated that delivering the message of the song was more important than "showing off [his] chops". He noted he was not interested in singing for the purpose of singing alone, but rather because he enjoyed getting the purpose of the song across. Fanning has stated: "For me, writing songs comes from anywhere", drawing inspiration from his experiences.

In his work on "<a href="Tea%20%26amp%3B%20Sympathy%20%28Bernard%20Fanning%20album%29">Tea & Sympathy</a>", Fanning noted less of a collaborative song style, referring to his inability to play <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>s as causing different elements to become a focus of the songs. In an interview, he said, "I wasn't relying on solos to be big features because I simply can't play them." Fanning explained that the shorter length of songs was due to him not having "four other people" to back him up when producing independently.

Fanning has stated his favourite band is <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>.

Fanning has stated that although political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, it is not the central focus when writing songs: "A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So if I write a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement." He has stated that he has no interest in "doing a '<a href="Peter%20Garrett">Peter Garrett</a>'", who entered politics after a successful <a href="Midnight%20Oil">Midnight Oil</a> career.

On 8 July 2007, Fanning wrote a piece for <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>'s "<a href="Sunday%20Mail%20%28Adelaide%29">Sunday Mail</a>", telling of his recent trip to <a href="Uluru">Uluru</a>. In the piece, he criticised those who <a href="Uluru%23Climbing">climbed</a> the rock, stating that he was "appalled that kids were being taught to disrespect the wishes of Aboriginal people on their own land". Upon returning from Uluru, Fanning wrote "<a href="Black%20Tears">Black Tears</a>", which intended to "document a relationship gone wrong". In his piece, Fanning also criticised the 17-year life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, and encouraged all to join a conversation on reconciliation.

Fanning takes a <a href="left%20wing%20politics">left-leaning</a> political stance, although he claims he is not fond of discussing the issue. Rather, he attempts to discuss the issues through his songs; "I approach writing a song about something like [Aboriginal affairs] the same way I would approach writing a song about a relationship, because it's something that I feel strongly about." However, he has occasionally stated his views on social and political issues, giving "<a href="The%20Dominion%20Post%20%28Wellington%29">The Dominion Post</a>" his stance on Aboriginal affairs in light of the Across the Great Divide tour;
Fanning has performed numerous philanthropic tasks independently and with Powderfinger. The band played at the 2005 <a href="WaveAid">WaveAid</a> concert to raise money for victims of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>, and the <a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20tour">Across the Great Divide tour</a> in 2007 to promote the efforts of <a href="Reconciliation%20Australia">Reconciliation Australia</a>. Fanning has contributed to charities including "A Just Australia" and <a href="Youngcare">Youngcare Australia</a>, and donates his time to <a href="youth%20detention%20center">youth detention centres</a> in Brisbane by running songwriting workshops. In an uncharacteristic outburst, Fanning once referred to fellow Australian artist <a href="Ben%20Lee">Ben Lee</a> as "a precocious little cunt", after Lee referred to himself as "the saviour of Australian music". Fanning later apologised for the comment.

Fanning married Andrea Moreno in February 2007 in Brisbane, Australia. Moreno is from Spain, where the two met while Fanning was writing and recording "<a href="Tea%20%26amp%3B%20Sympathy%20%28Bernard%20Fanning%20album%29">Tea & Sympathy</a>" in Europe. This relationship followed a twelve-year union Fanning had had with his previous girlfriend, and it was this break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric mood of "Tea & Sympathy". Through Moreno, Fanning has learned to speak some of the Spanish language. Fanning and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and Fanning was touring as a solo artist.

Fanning is a supporter of cricket and <a href="National%20Rugby%20League">National Rugby League</a> (NRL) club the <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a>.

The <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Awards</a> are presented annually from 1982 by the <a href="Australasian%20Performing%20Right%20Association">Australasian Performing Right Association</a> (APRA).

Central Link

Central Link is a <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> line in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington, United States, and part of <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>'s <a href="Link%20light%20rail">Link light rail</a> system. It serves 16 stations in the cities of Seattle, <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a>, and <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila</a>, traveling between and stations. The line connects the <a href="University%20District%2C%20Seattle">University District</a>, <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a>, the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a>, and <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>. Central Link carried over 24 million total passengers in 2018, with an average of 72,000 daily passengers on weekdays. It runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays and Saturdays, with <a href="headway">headway</a>s of up to six minutes during <a href="peak%20hour">peak hour</a>s, and reduced 18-hour service on Sundays and holidays. Trains are composed of two or more cars that each can carry 194 passengers, including 74 in seats, along with wheelchairs and bicycles.

Voters approved Central Link in a 1996 ballot measure and construction began in 2003, after the project was reorganized under a new budget and truncated route in response to higher than expected costs. The light rail line, which followed decades of failed transit plans for the Seattle region, opened on July 18, 2009, terminating at in the <a href="Downtown%20Seattle%20Transit%20Tunnel">Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel</a> and near Sea–Tac Airport. It was extended south to in December 2009, north to the University of Washington in March 2016, and south to Angle Lake in September 2016. The line is scheduled to be extended north to in 2021, followed by further extensions to and <a href="Federal%20Way%20Transit%20Center">Federal Way</a> in 2024. <a href="East%20Link%20Extension%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">East Link</a> will open in 2023, connecting Seattle to the <a href="Eastside%20%28King%20County%2C%20Washington%29">Eastside</a> suburbs and forming a multi-line network via its connection with Central Link. Further expansion under <a href="Sound%20Transit%203">Sound Transit 3</a> will divide Central Link between two lines, the Red Line from <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish County</a> to <a href="West%20Seattle%2C%20Seattle">West Seattle</a>, and the Green Line from <a href="Ballard%2C%20Seattle">Ballard</a> to <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>.

Public transit service within Seattle began in 1884, with the introduction of the city's first horse-drawn <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> line. The system had been replaced with a network of electric streetcars and <a href="cable%20car%20%28railway%29">cable cars</a> by the end of the decade, which spurred the development of new <a href="streetcar%20suburbs">streetcar suburbs</a> across modern-day Seattle. Interurban railways to <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, and the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a> were established after the turn of the century, giving the region an intercity passenger rail system to feed the streetcar lines. The interurban systems failed to compete with the increasing popularity of automobile travel, capped by the completion of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099">U.S. Route 99</a> in the late 1920s, and was shut down. By 1941, the streetcars had also been acquired by the municipal government and replaced with a <a href="Trolleybuses%20in%20Seattle">trolleybus network</a>.

Various proposals for a <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system in Seattle, to replace the streetcar—and later bus—networks, were presented in the 20th century and rejected by city officials or voters due to their cost or other factors. In 1911, urban planner <a href="Virgil%20Bogue">Virgil Bogue</a> proposed a system of subway tunnels and elevated railways as the centerpiece to a <a href="comprehensive%20plan">comprehensive plan</a> for the city, which was rejected by voters. The <a href="Seattle%20Center%20Monorail">Seattle Center Monorail</a>, originally built for the <a href="Century%2021%20Exposition">1962 World's Fair</a>, has been the subject of several unsuccessful expansion proposals backed by Governor <a href="Albert%20Rosellini">Albert Rosellini</a> in the 1960s and Seattle voters in the early 2000s. The <a href="Forward%20Thrust">Forward Thrust</a> Committee of the late 1960s proposed a rapid transit system, to connect Downtown Seattle to <a href="Ballard%2C%20Seattle">Ballard</a>, the <a href="University%20District%2C%20Seattle">University District</a>, <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Seattle">Lake City</a>, <a href="Capitol%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Capitol Hill</a>, <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, and <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton</a>. The federal government offered to fund two-thirds of the rail system's capital costs, approximately $770 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), if $385 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in local property taxes were approved by voters. The rapid transit initiative was placed on the ballot in February 1968, but failed to receive the necessary <a href="supermajority">supermajority</a> to pass. A second attempt in May 1970, with $440 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in local funding and $870 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in federal funding, failed amid a local economic downturn caused by layoffs at <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>. The federal funding earmarked towards the rapid transit system was granted to <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, forming the initial funding for the <a href="Metropolitan%20Atlanta%20Rapid%20Transit%20Authority">Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority</a>'s rail system.

Following the failed Forward Thrust initiatives, <a href="Municipality%20of%20Metropolitan%20Seattle">Metro Transit</a> was created in 1972 to oversee a countywide bus network, and plan for a future rail system. In the early 1980s, Metro Transit and the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Council%20of%20Governments">Puget Sound Council of Governments</a> (PSCOG) explored <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> and <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">busway</a> concepts to serve the region, ultimately choosing to build a <a href="Downtown%20Seattle%20Transit%20Tunnel">downtown transit tunnel</a> that would be convertible from buses to light rail at a later date. The PSCOG formally endorsed a light rail plan in 1986, recommending a system be built by 2020, and include a line between Seattle and <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Sea-Tac Airport</a>, with routing alternatives that served the Rainier Valley. A 1988 advisory measure on light rail planning was passed in <a href="King%20County%2C%20Washington">King County</a>, encouraging Metro Transit to accelerate the plan's timeline to open by 2000. In 1990, the <a href="Washington%20State%20Legislature">state legislature</a> endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from King, <a href="Pierce%20County%2C%20Washington">Pierce</a>, and <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish</a> counties, with the goal of implementing the regional transit plan. Several members of the <a href="Seattle%20City%20Council">Seattle City Council</a> endorsed the rail plan on the condition that it pass through the Rainier Valley, by then an economically disadvantaged and majority-minority neighborhood.

The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, later renamed <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>, was created in 1993 to write and present a regional transit plan for voter approval. The agency proposed a light rail network as the centerpiece of a $6.7 billion transit ballot measure, with a surface line through the Rainier Valley and tunnels between Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill, and the University District. The ballot measure failed to pass on March 14, 1995, and the light rail line was shortened to , between the University District and Sea-Tac Airport. Voters approved the $3.9 billion package on November 5, 1996, along with increases to sales taxes and motor vehicle <a href="excise%20tax">excise tax</a>es across the regional transit district. Sound Transit considered several routing options during a series of public hearings and studies early into the project's <a href="environmental%20impact">environmental impact</a> study, which adopted the name "Central Link". In 1999, Sound Transit selected the alignment for the light rail project, consisting of a line between the University District and Sea-Tac Airport, with surface segments passing through <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila</a>, the Rainier Valley, and <a href="SoDo%2C%20Seattle">SoDo</a>, and tunnels under <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Beacon Hill</a>, <a href="First%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">First Hill</a>, Capitol Hill, and <a href="Portage%20Bay">Portage Bay</a>.

The Central Link project was originally planned to open in 2006 and projected to cost $1.9 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars), but the estimates were found to be unrealistic by auditors in November 2000. New executives, hired by Sound Transit to replace previous program directors, presented a revised plan with an opening date pushed back three years to 2009, costing $3.8 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars). Planning of the Portage Bay tunnel between Capitol Hill and the University District was suspended due to higher than expected contractor bids, attributed to difficult soil conditions. Sound Transit adopted the revised budget and schedule in January 2001, including provisions to re-study routing options between Downtown Seattle and the University District, along with a $500 million federal grant agreement to fund the construction of an "initial segment" for the project. The initial segment identified and approved by Sound Transit later that year shortened the line to , between Downtown Seattle and a <a href="Tukwila%20International%20Boulevard%20station">southern Tukwila station</a> near Sea-Tac Airport. The remaining routes to the airport and University District were sent back to the planning stage, and re-organized into separate light rail projects.

In November 2001, Sound Transit approved construction of the shortened Central Link light rail project, calling for a summer 2002 groundbreaking. Property acquisition in the Rainier Valley began in March 2002, but two legal battles delayed the start of construction. In November 2002, the <a href="King%20County%20Superior%20Court">King County Superior Court</a> ruled in favor of Sound Transit in a lawsuit filed by light rail opponents, alleging that it lacked the authority to shorten a voter-approved line. The approval of <a href="Tim%20Eyman">Tim Eyman</a>'s Initiative 776 threatened to repeal motor vehicle excise taxes needed to fund Sound Transit's budget, but was declared unconstitutional in February 2003. Another routing change requested by the City of Tukwila, placing light rail tracks along freeways in lieu of International Boulevard, was approved by Sound Transit and the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a> in 2002, moving the project closer to construction.

Sound Transit received its $500 million federal grant agreement in October 2003, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in SoDo on November 8, 2003. Construction contracts for various segments were awarded in 2004 and 2005, coming six percent under Sound Transit's estimates, and work began along all parts of the system. The first rails were installed on August 18, 2005, in the SoDo area; a month later, the downtown transit tunnel closed for a two-year renovation to accommodate light rail service. Excavation of the <a href="Beacon%20Hill%20tunnel%20%28Seattle%29">Beacon Hill tunnel</a> and station began in 2005, and two <a href="tunnel%20boring%20machine">tunnel boring machine</a>s were launched in early 2006 to bore the twin tunnels between SoDo and the Rainier Valley.

The SODO and Stadium stations were completed in May 2006, and light rail testing in the SoDo area began the following March. Testing was extended to the re-opened downtown transit tunnel in September 2007, initially limited to weekends without bus service, and further to the Rainier Valley after the completion of the Beacon Hill tunnel in 2008. The elevated guideway in Tukwila, including crossings over major freeways and the <a href="Duwamish%20River">Duwamish River</a>, was completed in 2007 after the installation of 2,457 precast concrete segments and balanced <a href="cantilever%20bridge">cantilever bridge</a>s. During construction in the Rainier Valley, Sound Transit and the City of Seattle offered $50 million in mitigation funds and development opportunities to affected businesses. Construction of light rail along Martin Luther King Jr. Way South also resulted in utility lines being moved underground, improved sidewalks, street crossings, and landscaping.

Central Link was opened on July 18, 2009, with a community celebration that attracted more than 92,000 riders over the first weekend of free service. Trains began operating on the segment between and stations, along with a bus shuttle to serve Sea-Tac Airport from Tukwila. The extension to <a href="SeaTac/Airport%20station">SeaTac/Airport station</a> opened on December 19, 2009, replacing the shuttle and other bus services to the airport. Sound Transit added lubrication equipment and rubber mats to segments in Tukwila and the Rainier Valley in 2010 to reduce noise levels that had reached up to 83 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s, surpassing federal safety standards and triggering noise complaints from nearby residents. A contract dispute with the Rainier Valley construction contractor was settled in 2011, bringing the project's total price to $117 million below the $2.44 billion budget. The opening of light rail service to the Rainier Valley spurred new <a href="transit-oriented%20development">transit-oriented development</a>, which had initially stalled during the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a> but recovered in the mid-2010s.

Central Link train service was increased to a frequency of six minutes during peak hours, from 7.5 minutes, in 2015 to prepare for the opening of the <a href="University%20Link%20extension">University Link extension</a>. The line was extended north to <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20station">University of Washington station</a>, via <a href="Capitol%20Hill%20station">Capitol Hill station</a>, on March 19, 2016, via a $1.8 billion, tunnel. The extension opened six months ahead of its scheduled date, and the opening celebrations drew 67,000 people during the first day of service. Sound Transit deployed additional three-car light rail trains to cope with higher ridership after the extension opened. The line was extended south from Sea-Tac Airport to <a href="Angle%20Lake%20station">Angle Lake station</a> on September 24, 2016, including the opening of a 1,120-stall <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a>.

The escalators at Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations experienced several major failures and shutdowns in the two years since the University Link extension was opened. These failures were attributed to the installation of standard commercial escalators instead of stronger escalators designed for transit stations and are planned to be replaced by 2022 with new escalators and alternate stairways. The Tukwila section of the line was shut down over one weekend in October 2018 for major repairs after cracks were discovered in the rails on the bridge crossing Interstate 5.

Central Link's northern terminus is University of Washington station, located near <a href="Husky%20Stadium">Husky Stadium</a> and the campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> in northeastern Seattle. The line heads south in the <a href="University%20Link%20tunnel">University Link tunnel</a>, crossing under the <a href="Montlake%20Cut">Montlake Cut</a> of the <a href="Lake%20Washington%20Ship%20Canal">Lake Washington Ship Canal</a> and <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20520">State Route 520</a> before taking a turn to the southwest. The tunnel climbs <a href="Capitol%20Hill%20%28Seattle%29">Capitol Hill</a> and passes under <a href="Interlaken%20Park">Interlaken Park</a> and <a href="Volunteer%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">Volunteer Park</a> before turning due south to enter Capitol Hill station on the east side of <a href="Broadway%20%28Seattle%29">Broadway</a>. The tunnel makes a gradual turn to the west, dipping as far south as East Union Street, and crosses under <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> at Pine Street. It merges into the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel within the Pine Street Stub Tunnel, joining buses from <a href="Convention%20Place%20station">Convention Place station</a>.

The downtown transit tunnel, shared between light rail trains and buses, travels west under Pine Street through Westlake station and south on 3rd Avenue through <a href="University%20Street%20station">University Street</a> and <a href="Pioneer%20Square%20station">Pioneer Square</a> stations in <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a>. The tunnel ends at <a href="International%20District/Chinatown%20station">International District/Chinatown station</a>, adjacent to <a href="King%20Street%20Station">King Street Station</a> (served by <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> and <a href="Sounder%20commuter%20rail">Sounder commuter rail</a>), with buses continuing onto the <a href="SODO%20Busway">SODO Busway</a> and other streets. Central Link parallels the busway through <a href="Stadium%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">Stadium</a> and <a href="SODO%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">SODO</a> stations, traveling through several <a href="Boom%20barrier">gated crossings</a>. From SODO station, the track ascends to an elevated guideway traveling east along South Forest Street, passing the line's <a href="railyard">railyard</a> and maintenance facility. The elevated trackway passes over Airport Way and comes to rest on an embankment under Interstate 5, entering the Beacon Hill tunnel.

The Beacon Hill tunnel travels approximately under <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Beacon Hill</a>, serving <a href="Beacon%20Hill%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">a station</a> at Beacon Avenue South. Trains exit the tunnel on the east side of the hill, turning southeast and approaching the elevated <a href="Mount%20Baker%20station">Mount Baker station</a> at the intersection of Rainier Avenue South and Martin Luther King Jr. Way South. Light rail trains descend from Mount Baker station onto the <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, running at-grade with <a href="transit%20signal%20priority">signal priority</a> at 28 street crossings. Central Link passes through the Rainier Valley and serves three at-grade stations, , , and , before leaving Seattle.

The line enters Tukwila and crosses west over Interstate 5 and a mainline railroad at Boeing Access Road, near <a href="Boeing%20Field">Boeing Field</a>, before making a southward turn over East Marginal Way South. Central Link continues south over the Duwamish River, traveling non-stop through Tukwila on a elevated guideway. The guideway runs along the west sides of <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20599">State Route 599</a> and Interstate 5 towards <a href="Southcenter%20Mall">Southcenter Mall</a>, where it turns west along <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20518">State Route 518</a>. The line passes through Tukwila International Boulevard station, home to a 600-stall park and ride facility, and turns south into the median of the <a href="Airport%20Expressway%20%28Seattle%29">Airport Expressway</a> towards <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a>. Light rail trains continue along the east side of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, stopping at SeaTac/Airport station near the airport's terminals, before reaching <a href="Angle%20Lake%20station">Angle Lake station</a>, where it terminates.

Central Link, while officially a "light rail" line, has also been described as a "<a href="light%20metro">light metro</a>" hybrid by transit experts due to its <a href="grade%20separation">grade separated</a> sections and use of larger trainsets than typical American light rail systems. Approximately of the line is at-grade, including segments along freeways that are separated from intersecting roads.

Central Link stations are spaced approximately apart in most areas and are built with platforms to accommodate four-car train sets. Some stations are grade separated, with underground or elevated platforms connected to surface entrances by stairs, escalators, and elevators, while others were built at street level. The line's sixteen stations include bus connections, <a href="ticket%20vending%20machine">ticket vending machine</a>s, <a href="public%20art">public art</a>, and bicycle parking. Stations are also designed with clear sight lines on platforms, emergency phones and lights, and are monitored with surveillance cameras. , there are only two stations with park and ride facilities (Angle Lake and Tukwila International Boulevard); for other stations, Sound Transit and local governments are encouraging alternative means of transportation to and from stations, including bus riding, walking, or bicycling.

Central Link light rail trains run 20 hours per day from Monday to Saturday, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am, and 18 hours on Sundays and <a href="Federal%20holidays%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal holidays</a>, from 6:00 am to midnight. Trains operate most frequently during weekday <a href="peak%20period">peak period</a>s, running every six minutes from 6:00 am to 9:30 am and from 3:00 pm to 6:30 pm. Trains run every 10 minutes during midday and evening hours on weekdays and all day on weekends. Train frequency is reduced to every 15 minutes during the early morning and late night hours of all days.

End-to-end travel from University of Washington to Angle Lake stations takes 48 minutes, while trips between SeaTac/Airport station and Downtown Seattle take 38 minutes. The SeaTac–Westlake corridor was formerly served by King County Metro bus route 194, which took 32 minutes to travel between the two areas, and used bus stops that were closer to the terminal. The bus route ran at less frequent intervals, was subject to traffic delays, and had shorter hours of operation.

Central Link trains carried over 24.4 million total passengers in 2018, averaging 76,000 riders on weekdays. Ridership is measured by on-board infrared passenger counters that automatically record the number of people entering and leaving the train.

Ridership on Central Link has risen significantly from the beginning of service in 2009, when it averaged 15,500 per weekday. In 2010, ridership fell below projected levels due to the <a href="Great%20Recession%20in%20the%20United%20States">ongoing economic downturn</a>, with only 21,611 daily riders on the line. Ridership increased significantly in the following years, surpassing 25,000 daily riders in 2012, 30,000 in 2014, and 35,000 in 2015.

The opening of the University Link extension in March 2016 increased daily ridership by 66 percent in its first month of operation, and averaged 66,203 daily riders during the last quarter of the year. A single-day ridership record of 82,361 estimated boardings was set on April 8, 2016, credited to a <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> home opener and the <a href="Emerald%20City%20Comic%20Con">Emerald City Comic Con</a>. The record was surpassed five months later on September 30, estimated at 101,000 riders, due in part to home games for the <a href="Washington%20Huskies%20football">Washington Huskies football</a> team and Seattle Mariners.

Central Link uses a <a href="proof-of-payment">proof-of-payment</a> system, requiring valid payment before boarding and lacking a <a href="turnstile">turnstile</a> barrier at stations. Fares can be purchased as paper tickets at <a href="ticket%20vending%20machine">ticket vending machine</a>s at stations, credit or passes loaded on an <a href="ORCA%20card">ORCA card</a>, or through a <a href="mobile%20ticketing">mobile ticketing</a> app. Fare inspectors and transit police officers check for valid fares while aboard trains or in the fare-paid zone of stations; warnings and a $124 <a href="traffic%20citation">citation</a> are issued to passengers who do not present a valid ticket or a validated ORCA card.

Fares are calculated based on distance traveled, ranging from $2.25 to $3.25 for adults. ORCA card users are required to tap a reader before and after riding a train to calculate the fare. Reduced fares are available to elderly passengers, persons with disabilities, persons under the age of 18, and low-income passengers enrolled in ORCA Lift. Transfers from other modes, including buses, <a href="King%20County%20Water%20Taxi">water taxis</a>, and <a href="Seattle%20Streetcar">streetcars</a>, are only accepted using ORCA cards.

The current Central Link fleet consists of 62 <a href="low-floor%20tram">low-floor</a> light rail vehicles manufactured in Japan by <a href="Kinki%20Sharyo">Kinkisharyo</a>. The Kinkisharyo vehicles, built through a <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> with <a href="Mitsui%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Mitsui & Co.</a>, have 74 seats and can carry 194 seated and standing passengers at standard capacity; a maximum "<a href="crush%20load">crush load</a>" of 252 passengers per car can be carried by Link trains for short distances. Individual railcars are long and wide, sporting dual cabs that allow cars to travel in either direction. The interior is 70 percent low-floor, while the remaining 30 percent is raised above the floor and accessed via stairs. Railcars include four doors on each side, <a href="Folding%20seat">fold-up seating</a> areas for wheelchairs, and two bicycle hooks above <a href="luggage">luggage</a> storage areas. Central Link trains are typically arranged into two-car and three-car sets, but station platforms are built to accommodate four-car trains. The trains have a top speed of , but typically operate at on surface sections and on elevated and tunneled sections. Link uses a form of <a href="positive%20train%20control">positive train control</a> to prevent trains from exceeding the set speed limit for a given area.

Trains are supplied electricity through an <a href="Overhead%20line">overhead catenary</a> that is energized at 1,500 <a href="volt">volt</a>s <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> and converted to <a href="Three-phase%20electric%20power">three-phase</a> <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> through on-board <a href="inverter">inverter</a>s. While other North American light rail systems use 750 V technology, Sound Transit chose to use 1,500 V to reduce the number of <a href="electrical%20substation">electrical substation</a>s, which are spaced approximately apart. Sound Transit placed its initial order of 31 light rail vehicles in 2003, and added four more vehicles in 2005 for the extension to SeaTac/Airport station. The cars were assembled in Everett, to comply with <a href="Buy%20America">Buy America</a> requirements, and delivered from 2006 to 2008. Another 27 vehicles were ordered for the University Link extension in 2009 and were delivered from 2010 to 2011. The Central Link fleet is stored and maintained at a operating base in SoDo, between SODO and Beacon Hill stations, that was opened in 2007, and has a capacity of 104 light rail vehicles. Central Link trains are operated and maintained by <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a>.

In September 2016, Sound Transit approved a $554 million order to <a href="Siemens%20Mobility">Siemens Mobility</a> for 122 <a href="Siemens%20S70">S70 light rail vehicles</a> to be delivered beginning in 2019 to serve planned extensions to Northgate, Lynnwood, the Eastside, and Federal Way. Another 30 vehicles were added to the order in April 2017, bringing the total to 152 vehicles. A satellite maintenance facility, with a capacity of 96 vehicles, is planned to be constructed in Bellevue by 2020 to accommodate part of the new fleet.

Sound Transit's expansion ballot measures, passed as <a href="Sound%20Transit%202">Sound Transit 2</a> in 2008 and <a href="Sound%20Transit%203">Sound Transit 3</a> in 2016, enabled the planning of future Link light rail extensions, scheduled to open in stages between 2021 and 2040. The <a href="Northgate%20Link%20extension">Northgate Link extension</a> is scheduled to open in 2021, extending service north to <a href="Northgate%20Transit%20Center">Northgate Transit Center</a>, followed by the <a href="East%20Link%20Extension">East Link Extension</a> in 2023, creating a new line to Bellevue and <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a>. During construction related to East Link in early 2020, trains within the downtown transit tunnel are planned to be limited to single-track operations and divided into two lines at Pioneer Square station.

Following the opening of Northgate Link in 2021, Central Link will be re-branded as the "Red Line" between Northgate and Angle Lake, while "Blue Line" trains will travel between Northgate and Redmond on East Link, sharing tracks between Northgate and . The Red Line will be extended south and north to the suburbs of <a href="Federal%20Way%2C%20Washington">Federal Way</a> and <a href="Lynnwood%2C%20Washington">Lynnwood</a>, respectively, in 2024. In 2030, a branch of the Red Line to <a href="West%20Seattle%2C%20Seattle">West Seattle</a> will begin service, temporarily operating between Alaska Junction and <a href="SODO%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">SODO station</a>. The opening of an extension to Ballard in 2035, traveling via a new tunnel through Downtown Seattle, will split Central Link between two lines: the Red Line, operating from Lynnwood (and later <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>) to West Seattle; and the Green Line, operating from Ballard to Tacoma via the Rainier Valley and Sea-Tac Airport. Two <a href="infill%20station">infill station</a>s along the current route of Central Link are planned to open in 2031 at South Graham Street in the Rainier Valley and Boeing Access Road in northern Tukwila.

Sacrifice (video game)

Sacrifice is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> video game published by <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a> in 2000 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> platform. Developed by <a href="Shiny%20Entertainment">Shiny Entertainment</a>, the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was <a href="porting">ported</a> to <a href="Mac%20OS%209">Mac OS 9.2</a> in 2001.

Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, "Sacrifice" places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their <a href="Magic%20point">mana</a>—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, "Sacrifice" offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.

"Sacrifice" was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses <a href="Tessellation%20%28computer%20graphics%29">tesselation</a>: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, "Sacrifice" can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as <a href="Tim%20Curry">Tim Curry</a>, and the musical compositions of <a href="Kevin%20Manthei">Kevin Manthei</a>. "Sacrifice" was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, "Sacrifice" was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.

Published in 2000 for the <a href="Windows%2098">Windows 98</a> platform (and in the following year for <a href="Mac%20OS%209">Mac OS 9.2</a>), "Sacrifice" is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> video game that incorporates elements of the <a href="Action%20game">action</a> genre. Players control wizards, looking over their characters from behind. Each match starts the player with a wizard and an altar. Using the keyboard and mouse, players move their wizards around a virtual world, directing armies and casting spells to eliminate their opponents. A player's wizard defeats an opponent by desecrating his or her altar through the magical "sacrifice" of a friendly unit.
Wizards can cast spells that harm opponents (combat spells), heal damage taken, or summon creatures. More advanced combat spells affect large areas of the battlefield, taking the form of tornadoes and volcanoes. Casting spells requires energy, which the game represents in the form of <a href="Magic%20point">mana</a>. Recovery of mana is slow, but a wizard accelerates the process by staying close to his or her altar. Close proximity to one of several fountains of mana scattered across the world increases his or her recovery rate as well. A wizard can monopolize a mana fountain by erecting a structure known as a manalith over it. Because mana can always be regained, it is an infinite resource. Souls are the other type of resource in this game; they are used, along with mana, to summon creatures, who form the mainstay of the players' offensive capability. Unlike mana, souls are limited in quantity. Players start with a few souls and increase their resources by locating unclaimed souls, or by converting the souls of unfriendly creatures their wizards have killed.

Summoned creatures are mainly classified into three classes: melee, ranged, and air (flyers). In a <a href="rock-paper-scissors">rock-paper-scissors</a> manner, each class is a counter to another. Melee creatures inflict more damage to their ranged opponents, but cannot retaliate against flyers, which in turn are vulnerable to those who can attack at range. Several creatures also have special abilities, such as creating protective magical barriers, becoming invisible, or immobilizing their opponents. Two units, manahoars and sac doctors, have special purposes. Manahoars help to recharge their summoner's mana by channeling energy from manaliths to him or her. Sac doctors are summoned to extract the souls of fallen opponents and bring them back to the altar for conversion. These units are also summoned to hold the sacrificial rituals required for desecrating enemy altars; killing a sac doctor disrupts the process.

The spells and abilities of the creatures are designed along the ethos of five gods. Persephone, the Great Healer, bestows her followers with powers of regeneration and nature. Her counterpart, Charnel, God of Strife, celebrates death and decay; his creatures are <a href="undead">undead</a> and his spells drains the life of others. The other three gods—James, Stratos, and Pyro—govern natural elements, granting their followers abilities associated with earth, air, and fire, respectively.

Unlike other real-time strategy games released in or before 2000, "Sacrifice"s gameplay is not focused on large-scale management of resources and bases. Instead, the game emphasizes <a href="Micromanagement%20%28gameplay%29">micromanagement</a> of the players' units; success in the game is linked to meticulous control of individuals or small groups to overcome enemies. Players order their armies to assume <a href="Tactical%20formation">formations</a> by pressing an assigned key or navigating through a <a href="Context%20menu">pop-up menu</a>. The order can also be given by moving the mouse in specific patterns without waiting for the menu to appear.

"Sacrifice"s single-player campaign begins with a meeting between the protagonist Eldred and the blind seer Mithras on a war-torn world. Through voiceovers and <a href="Cutscene%23Animated%20cutscenes">cut scenes</a> rendered by the game engine, Eldred recounts to Mithras his background and the events that led to the world's current state. Eldred was a tyrannical emperor who ruled over the world of Jhera. However, his days of rule were numbered: his subjects were rebelling, and his enemies gathered at the borders of his realm. Turning to the mystical arts for a solution, Eldred summoned a demon, Marduk, to eliminate opposition to his rule. Marduk proved uncontrollable and ravaged Jhera. Eldred fled to the world that he and Mithras stand on. The world—having suffered a past cataclysm—was riven into a collection of five floating islands. A god rules over each realm, seeking to impose his or her own agenda. The rivalries among the gods are aggravated by Mithras's prophecy of a traitor amongst them. Sensing the opportunity for a new lease on life, Eldred offers his service to the gods.

The campaign spans ten missions. In each mission, the player chooses a god for Eldred to champion, receiving creatures and spells from that god. The player can build up a selection of units and spells from different gods by changing Eldred's allegiance between missions; the selections are used in later missions or multiplayer sessions. As the game progresses, the player's choices align Eldred with one god. Aside from the stated goals in each mission, there are secret objectives that if accomplished bestow bonuses to Eldred's attributes (magical and physical resistance, more mana, etc.).

Midway through the campaign, Eldred encounters Marduk again. The demon taunts the wizard and announces that this world will suffer the same fate as Jhera. Eldred warns the gods; they believe one of them supports the demon and fall upon each other to eliminate the traitor. By the last stage of the campaign, Eldred has helped one god to kill the others. After the end of the wizard's narration, Mithras reveals himself as Marduk. Stratos, the traitor, had planned for the demon to appear on this world and deliver the prophecy to the gods. Marduk berates Eldred for his naivety and starts the final battle. After defeating the demon, the player chooses one of two endings for Eldred: stay and help the last god rule the world, or leave and seek his destiny in other worlds.

"Sacrifice" features the capability for players to play matches against each other over computer networks; up to four players (human- or computer-controlled) can participate in a multiplayer match. Four modes of play are available: Skirmish, Slaughter, Soul Harvest, and Domination. Skirmish's gameplay is similar to that of the single-player mode; a player wins the match by banishing the others' wizards. The winner of Domination is the wizard who controls a certain number of manaliths. The goal in Slaughter is to amass the most kills, while wizards in Soul Harvest have to collect the most souls.

Initially, the multiplayer games could only be played over small-area networks of computers (<a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a>s), or over the internet through an integrated matchmaking service. Later <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">software patches</a> added online rankings and the capability to connect computers via <a href="Internet%20Protocol%20Suite">Internet Protocol Suite</a> (TCP/IP), allowing play over the internet without the matchmaking service. The Macintosh version's matchmaking, handled by <a href="GameRanger">GameRanger</a>, had to be installed through a patch. Multiplayer matches cannot be played between different computer platforms.

"Sacrifice"s development started in August 1997. The game's lead <a href="programmer">programmer</a>, Martin Brownlow, was inspired by "", which was released in 1985 for the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> computer. In the old game, players take turns to control wizards, summoning creatures and casting spells to eliminate each other. The video game industry was mostly ignorant of "Sacrifice"s development, partly due to Shiny's desire to avoid repeating the bad experience of marketing their last product "<a href="Messiah%20%28video%20game%29">Messiah</a>". Released in March 2000, the game was extravagantly promoted by Shiny during its development, and the resulting heavy scrutiny from the media greatly stressed the team who worked on the game. Learning from this mistake, Shiny adopted a low profile for "Sacrifice"; until the last several months of its development, no one outside the company knew of the game. According to Brownlow, his team was able to concentrate on developing the game without the media or "fan base questioning every decision that gets made along the way".

The bulk of the work was done by a small team. Game designer Eric Flannum, formerly of <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>, recalls that there were only three other key personnel: two programmers and an <a href="Computer%20animation">animator</a>. As more game features were developed, the team expanded. Flannum was tasked to lead four <a href="level%20designer">level designer</a>s, and Jon Gwyn joined Joby Otero on the art team. After the basic features of the game had been completed, James Phinney, lead designer and producer of Blizzard's 1998 real-time strategy game "<a href="StarCraft">StarCraft</a>", was hired to write the plot for the single-player campaign. His first draft was used as the script for recording placeholder voiceovers, which helped the team to judge the atmosphere in the game. Later, Shiny employed professional actors, such as <a href="Tim%20Curry">Tim Curry</a> and <a href="Brad%20Garrett">Brad Garrett</a>, and various <a href="Voice%20acting">voice artists</a>, such as <a href="Jennifer%20Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>, to record the final voices for the game's characters. <a href="Audio%20filter">Audio filter</a>s altered the voices for the gods, giving them a supernatural edge appropriate to their roles. For background music, Shiny hired <a href="Kevin%20Manthei">Kevin Manthei</a>, who had composed many scores for video games and big- and small-screen entertainment, such as "<a href="Scream%203">Scream 3</a>" and "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>". His compositions for "Sacrifice" were played by an orchestra of 25 instruments. Shiny's founder, <a href="David%20Perry%20%28game%20developer%29">David Perry</a>, was so busy with the game's development that he passed over the opportunity to create a video game for the science-fiction movie "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>".

"Sacrifice"s <a href="Game%20engine">graphics engine</a> was developed from "Messiah"s. The older game renders its characters by <a href="Tessellation%20%28computer%20graphics%29">tesselation</a>, using thousands of polygons to make up character models and decreasing the number of polygons when lesser details are required, such as drawing the object at a distance. A typical object in "Sacrifice" comprises 200 to 2,500 polygons. Shiny expanded the technology's application to the game's virtual world. The environment is not decorated with grass, flowers, and rocks by <a href="Texture%20mapping">overlaying two-dimensional images</a> of such objects on the terrain model. Instead, many tiny models of these terrain features litter the landscape. Objects in the game are composed of <a href="Special%20right%20triangles%2345%E2%80%9345%E2%80%9390%20triangle">isosceles right triangles</a>, each of which is infinitely divisible into two smaller isosceles right triangles. The array of infinite triangles derived from these divisions is stored in a binary triangle tree <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>, and the simplicity of the division and its data management algorithms frees up the graphic processor for other duties, allowing more resources to be spent on managing the <a href="level%20of%20detail">level of detail</a>. "Sacrifice"s spell effects are composed of <a href="parametric%20surface">parametric surface</a>s, which also can be broken down into triangles, facilitating tessellation.
In early 2000, the computer industry released the first video graphics cards capable of processing <a href="transform%2C%20clipping%2C%20and%20lighting">transform, clipping, and lighting</a> (T&L) instructions. With the appropriate software, these new cards took over the burden of T&L processing from the computer's processor, allowing more detailed graphics and smoother animation. Shiny capitalized on the breakthrough, spending a few weeks to rewrite a portion of "Sacrifice"s software. Brownlow and his team refined and improved the game's graphics, increasing the number of polygons per model and setting the software to scan through scenes a few more times to determine what objects to render and how to display them. "Sacrifice" was acknowledged as the first game on the market to make full use of the new graphic cards (the <a href="GeForce%202%20Series">GeForce 2</a> and <a href="Radeon">Radeon</a> series). Because of the adopted technology, animation in the game was smooth, without the jerkiness associated with overstressed graphical engines.

For the character models, Otero and his team eschewed conventional designs inspired by "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and other fantasies. Otero's ideal was that of "form follows function", by which a creature's capabilities or purposes are readily apparent from its appearance. In his opinion, a creature designed to kill enemies by exploding itself would simply be a "cartoon-ish bomb with feet". Otero's simple designs were expanded and fleshed out in detail by Gwyn, who was also responsible for creating Eldred's model. The artists' incorporation of humor in their work did not escape the video game industry's notice; many pointed out the quirky allusion of James, God of Earth, to <a href="Earthworm%20Jim%20%28video%20game%29">Earthworm Jim</a>, star of Shiny's previous games.

By June, the major features of the game had been implemented, and Shiny proceeded to the next stage of development. It selected a thousand members of the public to participate in a <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Beta">beta test</a> of "Sacrifice"s multiplayer modes, receiving feedback on <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s, performance issues, and possible improvements. The game's publisher, <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a>, assigned its <a href="quality%20assurance">quality assurance</a> department to test the single-player mode. Perry promoted the game by visiting professional game reviewers, such as FiringSquad, and giving copies of the beta version to them. On November 17, 2000, Interplay released the game for the Windows platform. Shiny packaged a <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a>, Scapex, with the finished product, allowing gamers to create their own levels. The tool <a href="WYSIWYG">displays the user's changes as they are added</a> to the level. Users have total control over the positioning of models and <a href="Scripting%20language">scripting</a> of events, although the tool does not provide the capability to create new spells or creatures. User-created maps can be shared with other players during the connection phase of multiplayer games.

Earlier in the same month, Macintosh software publisher <a href="MacPlay">MacPlay</a> announced that it was <a href="porting">porting</a> "Sacrifice" to the Apple computers. It took the company several months to adapt the source code to the Macintosh architecture, and on December 14, 2001, the Macintosh version of the game was released. It has almost the same features as the original version; however, Scapex was excluded from the port. Another feature left out was multiplayer mode, which MacPlay added through a software patch.

"Sacrifice" was developed and released during a period of growth for the video games market; the amount United States consumers spent on video games increased from <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>3.2 billion in 1995 to $6.0 billion in 2000. "Solid" real-time strategy games could sell more than 100,000 copies, and those that sold less than 75,000 copies were considered commercial failures by the publishers. Many real-time strategy game developers concentrated on enhancing their game's visuals without concern for innovations in gameplay. Shiny was recognized by the industry for its unconventional games, which exhibited humorous content and unique artistic designs. When it became known that the company was developing "Sacrifice" as its first real-time strategy game, several industry observers were keen to see whether it could deliver a quality product.
Initial reactions were favorable. "Sacrifice"s art was a point of focus for reviewers: the fantasy creatures' novel designs made deep impressions on the industry. The designs were so unconventional that gaming journalist Michael Eilers remarked, "It is as if <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a> and <a href="H.%20R.%20Giger">H. R. Giger</a> got together and played around with <a href="Autodesk%203ds%20Max">3D Studio Max</a> for a few weeks with a cooler full of <a href="Bass%20Brewery">Bass Ale</a> between them." To fellow journalist <a href="Kieron%20Gillen">Kieron Gillen</a>, "Sacrifice" resembled a version of the strategy game "<a href="Command%20and%20Conquer">Command and Conquer</a>" as designed by <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> painter <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>. Aside from being impressed by the details in the graphics, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Lee Haumersen found the creatures' movements fluid and believable, remarking, "flying dragons heave their bodies through the air reminiscent of Draco in the movie "<a href="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a>"." Journalist <a href="Tom%20Chick">Tom Chick</a> summed up the weird experience of seeing his wizard at the head of "a troop of flapping, crawling, loping, whirling, hopping things" as the essence of "what gaming is all about."

The game's spell effects also elicited positive reactions. <a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">"Next Generation" magazine</a>s Samuel Bass called them "awe-inspiring", while it was "positively breathtaking" for <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s John Bye to see "flaming missiles raining down on the battlefield, tornados lifting [his] men up into the sky, or the ground swelling up beneath [his wizard's] feet". Although such effects were implemented in other games, as Gillen pointed out, it was a vastly different experience to watch them from the first person perspective. Reviewers of FiringSquad and "PC Gamer" were equally overwhelmed by the stunning visual effects. Despite filling the screen with "winged, fully animated demons" and "multiple gigantic twisters spiraling gorgeously into the clouds", "Sacrifice" performed smoothly on the reviewers' machines, impressing the staff of <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">"Edge" magazine</a>.

Aside from the visuals, the game's audio attracted comments. GameSpot's staff enjoyed listening to the story unfold through the recorded voices. They found that the voice actors did not overact their roles despite the extravagant appearances of the characters. Instead, the actors' performance conveyed an extra depth to the personalities of these characters. Haumersen noted a few flaws in the game's vocal presentation: the character models' lip movements did not match their speech, and they had a limited number of gestures to accompany the words. Michael House of <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a> was not altogether impressed, finding the voice acting to be "spotty[,] ... ranging from hilarious to obnoxious."

To several reviewers, "Sacrifice" was flawed in its handling of combat. They found that the game's interface—which presented a viewpoint that looked over the wizard from behind—hindered them from having a clear picture of their characters' surroundings. The game's fast-paced combat ensured that fights tended to be messy affairs, where aside from picking out their units from a chaotic mass to issue commands, players had to see to their wizards' safety, and cast spells to support their army. Reviewers commented that once a player had lost a number of early battles, his or her army could never recover from its losses to win the match. "Sacrifice"s multiplayer games, as GameSpot's Sam Parker observed, tended to be long-drawn stalemates until the wizards obtained more powerful spells. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>"s Keith Pullin was disappointed that the game was not designed to reward tactics; in his experience, he achieved victory by continually summoning groups of creatures to attack the enemy. Bass agreed that the game was lacking in tactical play, but other aspects impressed him enough to downplay this failing in his assessment.

The intensity and excitement generated by the frenetic gameplay pleased IGN's Dan Adams, but Bye was so frustrated by his experience that he claimed to have suffered a massive increase in blood pressure. The game's heavy demand for micromanagement convinced "<a href="Maximum%20PC">Maximum PC</a>" to name "Sacrifice" the "best argument for gamers [to grow] a third hand", an opinion in line with Chick's comment that the interface "[seemed] to have been designed for one of the game's 13-fingered beasts". "Sacrifice"s gameplay had its supporters; the staff at "Edge", impressed with the game's controls and visual perspective, named it one of the "few titles [that took] strategy into the third dimension and convincingly used the extra plane for more than a dazzling 3D makeover".

No sales figures were released for "Sacrifice", but several members of the video game industry acknowledged the game did not sell well. James Bell, <a href="Infogrames">Infogrames</a>'s Senior Vice President of Creative Development, said that "Sacrifice", although an excellent game, suffered poor sales because it was badly marketed and released at the wrong time. Another reason, offered by Gillen, for "Sacrifice"s commercial failure was the small size of its development team. Based mostly on the efforts of four people, the game was built around their gaming preferences, failing to take into account the opinions of a wider variety; hence, the game became a niche product.

Impressing IGN with its "wonderful land full of character and imagination", "Sacrifice" was the gaming site's choice for the best strategy game of 2000. It was honored in the same year by <a href="European%20Computer%20Trade%20Show">European Computer Trade Show</a> as the Best PC Game of the Show. Since its release, "Sacrifice" has been one of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>"s Top 100 Games for at least eight consecutive years. Looking back at the history of real-time strategy gaming, Geryk pointed out that "Sacrifice"s "depth and originality" was unparalleled in the genre and often overlooked in favor of its graphics. The staff of gaming site <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a> shared a similar opinion, naming the game in 2009 as its eighteenth top strategy game of all time.

Although "Sacrifice" was honored as a quality game, industry observers pointed out that its qualities were forgotten by most people; the staff of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> said the game was "practically invisible to the gaming public", and according to Gillen, few remembered "Sacrifice" as the pioneer of the mouse-gesture control system, which was praised as revolutionary in <a href="Peter%20Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a>'s later game "<a href="Black%20%26amp%3B%20White%20%28video%20game%29">Black & White</a>". Gillen further lamented that "Sacrifice"s release heralded the end of Shiny's forays into creative game development, as the company switched to producing more mainstream products, such as "<a href="Enter%20the%20Matrix">Enter the Matrix</a>". Despite receiving numerous calls for a sequel, Shiny said in 2002 that it would not produce one. Seven years later, GamesRadar repeated the call for a sequel while proclaiming "Sacrifice" "one of the most underappreciated games of all time".

Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly (July 8, 1838 – June 6, 1898) was an American soldier, pharmacist, chemist, and businessman who founded the <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company">Eli Lilly and Company</a> pharmaceutical corporation. Lilly enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and recruited a company of men to serve with him in the <a href="18th%20Independent%20Battery%20Indiana%20Light%20Artillery">18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery</a>. He was later promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> and then <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, and was given command of the 9th Regiment Indiana Cavalry. Lilly was captured in September 1864 and held as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> until January 1865. After the war, he attempted to run a <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, but it failed and he returned to his pharmacy profession after the death of his first wife. Lilly remarried and worked with business partners in several pharmacies in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> before opening his own business in 1876 in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>. Lilly's company manufactured drugs and marketed them on a <a href="wholesale">wholesale</a> basis to pharmacies. Lilly's pharmaceutical firm proved to be successful and he soon became wealthy after making numerous advances in medicinal drug manufacturing. Two of the early advances he pioneered were creating gelatin capsules to contain medicines and developing fruit flavorings. Eli Lilly and Company became one of the first pharmaceutical firms of its kind to staff a dedicated research department and put into place numerous quality-assurance measures.

Using his wealth, Lilly engaged in numerous <a href="philanthropy">philanthropic</a> pursuits. He turned over the management of the company to his son, <a href="Josiah%20K.%20Lilly%2C%20Sr.">Josiah K. Lilly, Sr.</a>, around 1890 to allow himself more time to continue his involvement in charitable organizations and civic advancement. Colonel Lilly helped found the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis <a href="Chamber%20of%20Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a>, and became the primary patron of Indiana's branch of the <a href="Charity%20Organization%20Society">Charity Organization Society</a>. He personally funded a children's hospital in Indianapolis, known as Eleanor Hospital (closed in 1909). Lilly continued his active involvement with many other organizations until his death from <a href="cancer">cancer</a> in 1898.

Colonel Lilly was an advocate of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, and many of his suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting in the creation of the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of <a href="prescription%20drugs">prescriptions</a>, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20%28industrialist%29">Eli Jr.</a> and <a href="Josiah%20K.%20Lilly%2C%20Jr.">Josiah Jr.</a> (Joe), established the <a href="Lilly%20Endowment">Lilly Endowment</a> in 1937; it remains as one of the <a href="List%20of%20wealthiest%20charitable%20foundations">largest charitable benefactors</a> in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.

Eli Lilly, the son of Gustavus and Esther Lilly, was born in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, on July 8, 1838. His family was of <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> descent and had moved to the <a href="low%20country">low country</a> of <a href="France">France</a> before his great-grandparents immigrated to <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> in 1789. When Eli, the first of eleven children, was still an infant, the family moved to <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, where they eventually settled on a farm near <a href="Warsaw%2C%20Kentucky">Warsaw</a> in <a href="Gallatin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Gallatin County</a>. 
In 1852 the family settled at <a href="Greencastle%2C%20Indiana">Greencastle, Indiana</a>, where Lilly's parents enrolled him at Indiana Asbury University (later known as <a href="DePauw%20University">DePauw University</a>). Eli attended classes from 1852 to 1854. He also assisted at a local <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a> as a printer's devil. Lilly grew up in a Methodist household, and his family was <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a>ist and anti-slavery; their beliefs served as part of their motivation for moving to Indiana. Lilly and his family were members of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> during his early life, but they became <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> during the years leading up to the Civil War.

Lilly became interested in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while on a trip to visit his aunt and uncle in <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette, Indiana</a>, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year apprenticeship with Lawrence to become a chemist and pharmacist. In addition to learning to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his apprenticeship, Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work for Israel Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.

Lilly returned to Greencastle in 1860 to work in Jerome Allen's drugstore. He opened his own drugstore in the city in January 1861, and married Emily Lemon, the daughter of a Greencastle merchant, on January 31, 1861. During the early years of their marriage the couple resided in Greenfield. The couple's son, <a href="Josiah%20K.%20Lilly%20Sr.">Josiah Kirby</a>, later called "J. K.", was born on November 18, 1861, while Eli was serving in the military during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

In 1861, a few months after the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Lilly enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. He joined the <a href="1st%20Indiana%20Heavy%20Artillery%20Regiment">21st Indiana Infantry Regiment</a> and mustered into service on July 24. Lilly was commissioned as a second <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on July 29, 1861. On August 3, the 21st Indiana reached <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, where it remained for several months. Lilly resigned his commission in December 1861 and returned to Indiana to form an artillery unit.

In early 1862 Lilly actively recruited volunteers for his unit among his classmates, friends, local merchants and farmers. He had recruitment posters created and posted them around Indianapolis, promising to form the "crack battery of Indiana". His unit, the <a href="18th%20Independent%20Battery%20Indiana%20Light%20Artillery">18th Battery, Indiana Light Artillery</a>, was known as the Lilly Battery and consisted of six, three-inch ordinance rifles and 150 men. Lilly was commissioned as a <a href="captain">captain</a> in the unit. The 18th Indiana mustered into service at <a href="Camp%20Morton">Camp Morton</a> in Indianapolis on August 6, 1862, and spent a brief time drilling before it was sent into battle under <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a> in <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. Lilly's artillery unit was transferred to the <a href="Lightning%20Brigade">Lightning Brigade</a>, a mounted infantry under the command of <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a>, later <a href="General">General</a>, <a href="John%20T.%20Wilder">John T. Wilder</a> on December 16, 1862.

Lilly was elected to serve as the commanding officer of his battery from August 1862 until the winter of 1863, when his three-year enlistment expired. His only prior military experience had been in a Lafayette, Indiana, <a href="Indiana%20Legion">militia</a> unit. Several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command; however, despite his initial inexperience, Lilly became a competent artillery officer. His battery was instrumental in several important battles, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hoover%27s%20Gap">Battle of Hoover's Gap</a> in June 1863 and in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Chattanooga">Second Battle of Chattanooga</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> in September 1863.

In 1864, when Lilly's term of enlistment ended, he resigned his commission and left the 18th Indiana. Lilly joined the 9th Indiana Cavalry (121st Regiment Indiana Volunteers) and was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sulphur%20Creek%20Trestle">Battle of Sulphur Creek Trestle</a> in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> in September 1864, he was captured by <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> troops under the command of Major General <a href="Nathan%20B.%20Forrest">Nathan B. Forrest</a> and held in a prisoner-of-war camp at <a href="Enterprise%2C%20Clarke%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Enterprise, Mississippi</a> until his release in a prisoner exchange in January 1865. Lilly was promoted to colonel on June 4, 1865, and was stationed at <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, in the spring of 1865 when the war ended. In recognition of his service, he was <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevetted</a> to the rank of lieutenant colonel and mustered out of service with the 9th Indiana Cavalry on August 25, 1865.

In later life Lilly obtained a large atlas and marked the path of his movements in the war and the location of battles and skirmishes. He often used the atlas when telling war stories. His colonel's title stayed with him for the rest of his life, and his friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly served as chairman of the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a>, a brotherhood of Union Civil War veterans, in 1893. During his term he helped organize an event that brought tens of thousands of Union war veterans, including Lilly's battery, together in Indianapolis for a reunion and a large parade.

After the war, Lilly remained in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> to begin a new business venture. Lilly and his business partner leased a cotton plantation in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. Lilly traveled to Greencastle, Indiana, and returned with his wife, Emily, his sister, Anna Wesley Lilly, and son, Josiah. Shortly after the move the entire family was stricken with a mosquito-borne disease, probably <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, that was common in the region at that time. Although the others recovered, Emily died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly; he wrote to his family, "I can hardly tell you how it glares at me ...it's a bitter, bitter truth ... Emily is indeed dead." Lilly abandoned the farm and returned to Indiana. The plantation fell into disrepair and a drought caused its cotton crop to fail. Lilly's business partner, unable to maintain the plantation because of the drought, disappeared with the venture's remaining cash. Lilly was forced to file for <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> in 1868. 
Lilly worked to resolve the situation on the plantation and find other employment while his young son, Josiah, lived with Colonel Lilly's parents in Greencastle. In 1867 Lilly found work at the Harrison Daily and Company, a wholesale drug firm. In 1869 he began working for Patterson, Moore and Talbott, another medicinal wholesale company, before he moved to Illinois to establish a new business. In 1869 Lilly left Indiana to open a drugstore with James W. Binford, his business partner. Binford and Lilly opened The Red Front Drugstore in <a href="Paris%2C%20Illinois">Paris, Illinois</a>, in August 1869.

In November 1869 Colonel Lilly married Maria Cynthia Sloan. Soon after their marriage they sent for his son, Josiah, who was living Greencastle, to join them in Illinois. Eli and Maria's only child, a daughter named Eleanor, was born on January 25, 1871, and died of diphtheria in 1884 at the age of thirteen. Maria died in 1932.

Although the business in Illinois was profitable and allowed Lilly to save money, he was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. Lilly began formulating a plan to create a medicinal wholesale company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 to return to Indianapolis, where he opened a drug manufacturing operation on January 1, 1874, called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner. Three years later, on March 27, 1876, Lilly dissolved the partnership. His share of the assets amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash.

When Lilly approached Augustus Keifer, a wholesale druggist and family friend, for a job, Keifer encouraged Lilly to established his own drug manufacturing business in Indianapolis. Keifer and two associated drugstores agreed to purchase their drugs from Lilly at a cost lower than they were currently paying.

On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented two-story building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street and began to manufacture drugs. The sign for the business said "Eli Lilly, Chemist". Lilly's manufacturing venture began with $1,400 ($ in 2015 <a href="chained%20dollars">chained dollars</a>) in <a href="working%20capital">working capital</a> and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah, who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.

Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coated pills and capsules. Other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made medicines easier to swallow. Following his experience with the low-quality medicines used in the Civil War, Lilly committed himself to producing only high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective <a href="patent%20medicine">patent medicine</a>s of the day. One of the first medicines he began to produce was <a href="quinine">quinine</a>, a drug used to treat malaria, that resulted in a "ten fold" increase in sales. Lilly products gained a reputation for quality and became popular in the city. At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($ in 2015 chained dollars), and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).

As sales expanded rapidly he began to acquire customers outside of Indiana. Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James, and the subsequent sales team that developed, marketed the company's drugs nationally. Other family members were also employed by the growing company; Lilly's cousin Evan Lilly was hired as a bookkeeper and his grandsons, <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20%28industrialist%29">Eli</a> and <a href="Josiah%20K.%20Lilly%2C%20Jr.">Josiah</a> (Joe), were hired to run errands and perform other odd jobs. In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the firm as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates. By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly had become one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, with a company of more than one hundred employees and $200,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.
To accommodate his growing business, Lilly acquired additional facilities for research and production. Lilly's business remained at the Pearl Street location from 1876 to 1878, then moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian. In 1881 he purchased a complex of buildings at McCarty and Alabama Streets, south of downtown Indianapolis, and moved the company to its new headquarters. Other businesses followed and the area developed into a major industrial and manufacturing district of the city. In the early 1880s the company also began making its first, widely-successful product, called Succus Alteran (a treatment for venereal disease, types of rheumatism, and skin diseases). Sales of the product provided funds for company research and additional expansion.

Believing that it would be an advantage for his son to gain a greater technical knowledge, Lilly sent Josiah to the <a href="Philadelphia%20College%20of%20Pharmacy">Philadelphia College of Pharmacy</a> in 1880. Upon returning to the family business in 1882, Josiah was named superintendent of the laboratory. In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including the automation of capsule production. Over the next few years, the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.

Although there were many other small pharmaceutical companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms to ensure that the drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.

By the time of his retirement from his business, around 1890, Lilly was a millionaire who had been involved in civic affairs for several years. Later in life he had become increasingly more <a href="philanthropy">philanthropic</a>, granting funds to charitable groups in the city.

In 1879, with a group of twenty-five other businessmen, Lilly began sponsoring the <a href="Charity%20Organization%20Society">Charity Organization Society</a> and soon became the primary patron of its Indiana chapter. The society merged with other charitable organizations to form the Family Welfare Society of Indianapolis, a forerunner to the Family Service Association of Central Indiana and the <a href="United%20Way%20of%20America">United Way</a>. The associated group organized charitable groups under a central leadership structure that allowed them to easily interact and better assist people by coordinating their efforts and identifying areas with the greatest need.

Lilly was especially interested in encouraging economic growth and general development in Indianapolis. He attempted to achieve those goals by supporting local commercial organizations financially and through his personal advocacy and promotion. In 1879 he made a proposal for a <a href="public%20water%20supply">public water</a> company to meet the needs of the city, which lead to the formation of the Indianapolis Water Company.

In 1890 Lilly and other civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected as its first president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis <a href="Chamber%20of%20Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a> in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city development goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric utility companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.

After the <a href="Indiana%20Gas%20Boom">Gas Boom</a> began to sweep the state in the 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members advocated the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the <a href="Trenton%20Gas%20Field">Trenton Gas Field</a>, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project led to the creation of the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.

During the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, Lilly created a commission to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led him to make a personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.

Lilly's friends often urged him to seek public office, and they attempted to nominate him to run for <a href="Governor%20of%20Indiana">Governor of Indiana</a> as a Republican in 1896, but he refused. Lilly shunned public office, preferring to focus his attention on his philanthropic organizations. He did regularly endorse candidates, and made substantial donations to politicians who advanced his causes. After former Indiana governor <a href="Oliver%20P.%20Morton">Oliver P. Morton</a> and others suggested the creation of a memorial to Indiana's many Civil War veterans, Lilly began raising funds to build the <a href="Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Indianapolis%29">Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument</a>. Construction began in 1888, but the monument was not completed until 1901, three years after Lilly's death. The interior of the monument houses a civil war museum, established in 1918, that is named in Lilly's honor.

Colonel Lilly's main resident was a large home in Indianapolis on Tennessee Street (renamed Capitol Street in 1895), where he spent most of his time. Lilly, an avid fisherman, built a family vacation cottage on <a href="Lake%20Wawasee">Lake Wawasee</a> in <a href="Kosciusko%20County%2C%20Indiana">Kosciusko County, Indiana</a>, in 1886–87. He had enjoyed regular vacations and recreation at the lake since the early 1880s. Lilly also founded the Wawasee Golf Club in 1891. Lilly's lakeside property became a haven for the family. His son, Josiah, built his own cottage on the estate in the mid-1930s.

Lilly developed cancer in 1897 and died in his Indianapolis home on June 6, 1898. His funeral was held on June 9 and attended by thousands. His remains are interred in a large <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> at Indianapolis's <a href="Crown%20Hill%20Cemetery">Crown Hill Cemetery</a>.

At the time of Lilly's death in 1898, his company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars). His son, Josiah, inherited the company following his father's death, and became its president in 1898. Josiah continued to expand its operations before passing it on to his own sons, <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20%28industrialist%29">Eli Jr.</a> and <a href="Josiah%20K.%20Lilly%20Jr.">Josiah Jr.</a> (Joe).

Lilly's son and two grandsons, as well as the Lilly company, continued the philanthropic efforts that Lilly practiced. Eli Lilly and Company played an important role in delivering medicine to the victims of the devastating <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>. In 1937 Lilly's son and grandsons established the <a href="Lilly%20Endowment">Lilly Endowment</a>, which became the <a href="List%20of%20wealthiest%20charitable%20foundations">largest philanthropic endowment</a> in the world in terms of assets and charitable giving in 1998. (Other endowments have since surpassed it, but it still remains among the top ten.)

Lilly's firm grew into one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Under the leadership of Lilly's son, Josiah (J. K.) and two grandsons, Eli and Joe, it developed many new innovations, including the pioneering and development of <a href="insulin">insulin</a> during the 1920s, the mass production of <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> during the 1940s, and the promotion of advancements in mass-produced medicines. Innovation continued at the company after it was made a <a href="Public%20company">publicly traded corporation</a> in 1952; it developed <a href="Humulin">Humulin</a>, <a href="Thiomersal">Merthiolate</a>, <a href="Prozac">Prozac</a>, and many other medicines. According to <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>, Eli Lilly and Company ranked as the 243rd largest company in the world in 2016, with sales of $20 billion and a market value of $86 billion (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>). It is the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.

Lilly's greatest contributions to the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.

The <a href="Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Indianapolis%29">Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum</a>, located beneath the Sailors' and Soldiers' Monument in Indianapolis, is named in Lilly's honor. It features exhibits about <a href="Indiana%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Indiana during the war period</a> and the war in general.

Colonel Lilly is featured in the <a href="Indiana%20Historical%20Society">Indiana Historical Society</a> exhibition, "You Are There: "Eli Lilly at the Beginning"," at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis. The temporary exhibition (October 1, 2016, to January 20, 2018) includes a recreation of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street in Indianapolis and a costumed interpreter portraying Lilly.

Rejoined

"Rejoined" is the 78th episode of the American science fiction television series "", the sixth of the . It originally aired on October 30, 1995, in <a href="broadcast%20syndication">broadcast syndication</a>. The episode received a record volume of feedback from viewers for the series, both positive and negative, as it marked one of the first <a href="Lesbian%20kiss%20episode">televised lesbian kisses</a>. 

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on <a href="Deep%20Space%20Nine%20%28space%20station%29">Deep Space Nine</a>, a space station located near a stable <a href="wormhole">wormhole</a> between the <a href="Galactic%20quadrant%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Alpha and Gamma quadrants</a> of the Milky Way Galaxy. The plot of "Rejoined" expands on the <a href="Trill%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Trill</a> species, of which <a href="Jadzia%20Dax">Jadzia Dax</a> is a member. They are formed of a host and a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiont</a>, with the symbiont passed from host to host as the previous one dies. In the episode, Dax is reunited with Lenara Kahn, the ex-wife of one of its former hosts. The two struggle with their feelings for one another because of the taboo in their species against reuniting with loved ones of former hosts as they work together to experiment on <a href="wormholes">wormholes</a>.

The episode was the first that writers <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Echevarria">René Echevarria</a> wrote together, and it was directed by main cast member <a href="Avery%20Brooks">Avery Brooks</a>. In the first draft, Dax's former partner was written as male, but after this was changed, the story was cleared through studio executives. The Trill taboo was intended to be an allegory for <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a>. "Rejoined" received a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of seven percent on the first broadcast in syndication. Reviews have been mostly positive towards the episode because of its message, but there was criticism that the plot was not exciting enough and there was a negative reaction from some viewers.

Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Sisko">Benjamin Sisko</a> (<a href="Avery%20Brooks">Avery Brooks</a>) notifies Lieutenant Commander <a href="Jadzia%20Dax">Jadzia Dax</a> (<a href="Terry%20Farrell%20%28actress%29">Terry Farrell</a>) that a group of <a href="Trill%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Trill</a> scientists will be arriving soon at <a href="Deep%20Space%20Nine%20%28space%20station%29">Deep Space Nine</a> to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiont</a>, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (<a href="Susanna%20Thompson">Susanna Thompson</a>), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major <a href="Kira%20Nerys">Kira Nerys</a> (<a href="Nana%20Visitor">Nana Visitor</a>) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. <a href="Julian%20Bashir">Julian Bashir</a> (<a href="Alexander%20Siddig">Alexander Siddig</a>) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.

A party is held for the team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work together on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard <a href="USS%20Defiant">USS "Defiant"</a>. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a <a href="Chaperone%20%28social%29">chaperone</a>. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), who is on the science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.

Dax confides in Sisko that she knows she is in love with her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their symbionts would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and "Defiant" is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a <a href="force%20field%20%28science%20fiction%29">force field</a> across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.

"Rejoined" marked the first time that longtime "Star Trek" writers <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Echevarria">René Echevarria</a> wrote a script together. They had been hired by executive producer <a href="Michael%20Piller">Michael Piller</a> following separate unsolicited manuscripts submitted during the of "", and had remained on the staff of the franchise since. In Echevarria's first draft of the story, there was no lesbian element as Dax's former lover was male. The Trill taboo against reuniting relationships from past hosts was suggested by Piller early on in the creation of "Deep Space Nine", in order for the society to prevent an "aristocracy of the joined", where joined hosts never met anyone that they did not already know.

It was Moore's suggestion to make Dax's former partner a woman in order to tackle the taboo against <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> by way of the on-screen taboo against re-association. At that stage, they intended to make no reference in the script to any characters having a concern about Dax's relationship with a woman so as to focus the story. Clearance was sought for the plot, first from <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a> <a href="Ira%20Steven%20Behr">Ira Steven Behr</a>, then executive producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a>, and finally from the studio executives. Moore later explained that they agreed to the idea, saying that "Star Trek" stood for making statements like those in "Rejoined".

Terry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding that "Gender wasn't the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in." She was pleased to be able to "stand up" for the <a href="LGBT%20community">LGBT community</a>. A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in "The Next Generation" episode "". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, <a href="Beverly%20Crusher">Beverly Crusher</a>. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a "<a href="macguffin">macguffin</a>" by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into "Rejoined". This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from "" originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either "Rejoined" or "". Instead, the plot, which involved <a href="Rom%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Rom</a> forming a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>, was expanded into the main plot of its own episode.

The episode was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks, who played Benjamin Sisko in the series, who later said that "Rejoined" was his favourite of the episodes he directed. He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, and that it was an extraordinary story about losing someone you love and having that person restored to you some time afterward. Following the death of Jadzia in the finale, "<a href="Tears%20of%20the%20Prophets">Tears of the Prophets</a>", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as "Rejoined" between the new Dax host and <a href="Worf%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Worf</a>, as the two were in a relationship at that point. Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called <a href="Ezri%20Dax">Ezri</a>, as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character. The prejudice against re-association first highlighted in "Rejoined" was mentioned in the episodes such as "".

Visual effect supervisors <a href="Gary%20Hutzel">Gary Hutzel</a> and Glenn Neufeld were busy completing post-production work on the opening episode of the fourth season, "". In their place, visual effects coordinator David Takemura led on the visual effects work on both "Rejoined" and "". For this episode, his two main tasks were the creation of the artificial wormhole and the sequence where Dax uses a forcefield as a walkway to reach a trapped Kahn. Takemura was relieved that the wormhole was intended to be artificial in nature, as it meant that he did not have to attempt to re-create the detail already seen in the Bajoran wormhole on the series. Once he came up with the basic design, visual effects company <a href="VisionArt">VisionArt</a> completed it.

For the forcefield scene, Farrell was shot "skating" down a board painted blue against a <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a>. A mixture of <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> and hot water was used to create a fog around the ground. VisionArt combined these shots with the force field and footage of the engineering set on board the "Defiant", while a staff animator added a "plasma glow" around her feet as she made contact with the field.

Before appearing in "Rejoined", Susanna Thompson had previously appeared in two "The Next Generation" episodes; "<a href="The%20Next%20Phase">The Next Phase</a>" and "". She later appeared in "" as the <a href="Borg%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Borg Queen</a>, previously portrayed by <a href="Alice%20Krige">Alice Krige</a> in the film "". Farrell praised Thompson's part in "Rejoined", calling her a "wonderful actress and a joy to work with".

Writers on "Deep Space Nine" had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the episode "", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would be a time when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in "Rejoined". Allen Kwan has argued that "Deep Space Nine" is the only series of "Star Trek" that resists the <a href="heteronormativity">heteronormativity</a> typical of the franchise, citing both "Rejoined" and the <a href="Mirror%20Universe">Mirror Universe</a> episodes as examples, even if the presented <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a> is <a href="problematization">problematized</a>.

During that 1995/96 television season there had been an increase in the number of homosexual characters appearing in major television series, and so the same-sex kiss in "Rejoined" was reviewed in this context. An article published by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> suggested that the kiss in "Deep Space Nine" was not truly a same-sex kiss due to "extenuating circumstances"; namely, one of the characters was an "alien who used to be a man". A similar opinion was offered by Jan Johnson-Smith, author of "American Science Fiction TV", who said that the situation was "ambiguous" as, despite presenting a same-sex kiss, the episode was clear that Jadzia was "actually kissing the symbiont who has the memories of the former host, her male lover, not the current female host".

For <a href="film%20studies">film studies</a> scholar Jean Bruce, the ambiguity of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a "pleasurable surprise", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to "convey physical distance and the desire to bridge it", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is "informed by the fact that Dax was a man in her past life", once it occurs, it can "never be taken back", and remains the <a href="queer">queer</a> image of two women kissing.

Nonetheless, "Rejoined" was still considered controversial because of its subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included one of the first <a href="Lesbian%20kiss%20episode">televised lesbian kisses</a>. During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, only that she was an ex-spouse. David Greven, literary critic and author of "Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek", said that "Rejoined" was one of the better-received episodes of "Star Trek" that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues. <a href="Bryan%20Fuller">Bryan Fuller</a>, who also wrote for "Deep Space Nine", said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality. Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series.

"Rejoined" was first broadcast on October 30, 1995, in <a href="broadcast%20syndication">broadcast syndication</a>. It received <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a>s of 7 percent, placing it in eighth place in its timeslot. This was lower than the share received by "<a href="Indiscretion%20%28Star%20Trek%20Deep%20Space%20Nine%29">Indiscretion</a>", broadcast in the week prior with a 7.2 percent share and "" in the week afterward with 7.7 percent.

When the episode was originally broadcast, there was a strong negative reaction from some viewers. As "Deep Space Nine" was shown in syndication, one channel in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a> took the step of editing out the kiss from the initial broadcast. Echevarria's mother told him that they should have issued a parental guidance warning before broadcasting it. More responses were received at the production office from viewers than for any other episode of the series, resulting in several staff members having to take turns on the phones in order to cover the load. The staff found that although the majority of the phone calls were negative about "Rejoined", the letters were mostly positive. Terry Farrell said in a 2015 interview that "Rejoined" was her favourite episode of all time and that she still had people thanking her for the episode, because "it gave them strength, and that it made them feel like they weren't alone, it inspired them to be themselves—all the things I was hoping it would do."

Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" in 2013, praising the natural manner in which the romance was progressed, saying that this was "refreshing" to see. He felt that the relationship did not appear to be manipulative for the sake of male viewers, but added that the ending was expected and that the episode never communicated to the audience the need to care about the duo. Handlen wrote that the overall story itself was "shallow", as the episode suffered from an "enervating lack of fun" which was only saved from "complete tedium" through "strong acting and an admirable lack of stigma". Jordon Hoffman, reviewing the episode on his website, commented that Farrell's acting "really steps up to the plate" for this episode, and gave "Rejoined" a rating of five out of five.

<a href="Keith%20DeCandido">Keith DeCandido</a>, in 2014 review on <a href="Tor.com">Tor.com</a>, compared "Rejoined" structurally to "The Next Generation" episode "", which also had a "love-interest-in-danger climax". He praised the episode, saying that at the time of broadcast it was considered "radical" and said that both Farrell and Thompson managed to get across the romantic message. He called it a ""Trek" message" episode, but said that it was one of the better ones as it "shines a light on an inadequacy in our own culture via an alien culture, but in this case it muddies the waters a bit because the taboo actually makes sense on the face of it". He gave "Rejoined" a rating of eight out of ten.

Dara Gellman, an independent Canadian <a href="video%20artist">video artist</a>, used the kiss sequence in "Rejoined" as the basis of her 3-minute 1999 project "alien kisses". In this piece, the kiss scene is manipulated—the video is slowed, the image enlarged and digitized—and <a href="trance%20music">trance music</a> is added. New media scholar Carolyn Guertin argues that this serves to make the footage "even more alien", presenting queerness as "unearthly". Jean Bruce argues that, despite the inherent ambiguity of the scene in the episode, "the image is still one of two women kissing, which opens up the possibilities of queer desire on its own terms". Similarly, Guertin argues that Gellman translates the (not truly queer) scene into an "expression of gay love that is alien and apart, but no less erotic for being so". In using the scene in isolation, "alien kisses", Bruce argues, "strips away the gender equivocation by imposing a new queer vision". She suggests that "alien kisses" works as an "antidote" to the "ultimately tame treatment" "Star Trek" has offered of queer themes, and as a "suggestion" that "Star Trek" acknowledge the desires of queer viewers and fans "beyond the occasional titillating episode".

The first home media release of "Rejoined" was on a <a href="VHS">VHS</a> cassette alongside "<a href="Indiscretion%20%28Star%20Trek%20Deep%20Space%20Nine%29">Indiscretion</a>" on March 25, 1996, in the United Kingdom. The first release within the United States was on a single-episode VHS release on August 1, 2000. It was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> as part of the season four box set on August 5, 2003.

Neil Brooks (born 27 July 1962) is an Australian former sprint <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyle swimmer</a> best known for winning the 4 × 100 m medley relay at the <a href="1980%20Summer%20Olympics">1980 Olympics</a> in Moscow as part of the "<a href="Quietly%20Confident%20Quartet">Quietly Confident Quartet</a>". Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the <a href="1986%20Commonwealth%20Games">1986 Commonwealth Games</a>. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid alcohol problems.

Born in England, Brooks emigrated to Australia as a toddler and started swimming lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, but it was not until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a <a href="FINA%20Swimming%20World%20Cup">FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup</a> meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100 m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100 m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4 × 100 m medley relay, when he caught and passed the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="Sergey%20Kopliakov">Sergey Kopliakov</a> during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.

Following the Olympics, Brooks was expelled from the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">Australian Institute of Sport</a> by <a href="Don%20Talbot">Don Talbot</a> for disciplinary reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>, where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards. He returned to Australia for the <a href="1982%20Commonwealth%20Games">1982 Commonwealth Games</a> in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks was involved in a physical altercation with the team manager. As a result, he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100 m freestyle and anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">Los Angeles in 1984 Games</a>, where he won silver in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay. Brooks' international career ended at the <a href="1986%20Commonwealth%20Games">1986 Commonwealth Games</a> in Edinburgh with silver in the 100 m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay. Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip. He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a disciplinary incident.

An only child, Brooks was born in <a href="Crewe">Crewe</a>, England, before migrating to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> when he was four, along with his working-class parents Mick and Norah. His first aquatic adventure was almost his last. Aged seven, he was playing with a friend on the shore of the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a> when they climbed into a boat that drifted deeper into water and overturned. Brooks was forced to cling to the boat as his friend swam ashore to seek help. His parents immediately enrolled him in swimming lessons at the Marylands Swim Club. Shortly after, he switched to the tutelage of Kevin Duff, who coached him for the next fifteen years. After just six weeks under Duff, Brooks came third in the 50 m breaststroke at the State Age Championships. Despite coaching the likes of Olympic medallists <a href="Kevin%20O%27Halloran">Kevin O'Halloran</a>, <a href="Lyn%20McClements">Lyn McClements</a>, <a href="David%20Dickson%20%28swimmer%29">David Dickson</a> and <a href="Lynne%20Watson">Lynne Watson</a>, Duff was virtually unknown outside Western Australia. Brooks was known for his rebellious nature, and had a glowing assessment of his coach, opining that "He's not pushy like many other Australian coaches and he's not in the politics of Australian swimming".

Brooks attended <a href="Hale%20Primary%20School">Hale Primary School</a> and trained at <a href="Beatty%20Park">Beatty Park Pool</a>, routinely dominating the State Age Championships. He won bronze in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, and silver in the 200 m freestyle at the 1974 Australian Age Championships. Owing to a lack of style, he was known during his primary school years as "Basher Brooks", but by the time he entered <a href="Churchlands%20Senior%20High%20School">Churchlands Senior High School</a>, his stroke had become more technically refined. Nevertheless, he was always confident in his mental ability, stating "before I just swam on guts, now I had the stroke as well as the guts. I was always the toughest kid in the race."

At the age of 13, Brooks suffered a loss of confidence. After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years, he was now frequently losing. The other children had grown more at the start of their adolescence and he was struggling to match them. Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position. He also switched from distance to sprint events.

In 1976, at the age of 13, Brooks competed at his first open Australian Championships, but did not gain any podium finishes and as such missed selection in the team for the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> in Montreal. In the same year, the Australian team came to Perth for its pre-Olympic training camp and were billeted in the homes of members of the local swimming community. Brooks' family took his future relay team-mate <a href="Mark%20Tonelli">Mark Tonelli</a>, who had a reputation for indiscipline. Brooks, however, was inspired by Tonelli and cited him as a key motivating factor in him wanting to become an Olympian.

During the 1976–77 season, Brooks came to prominence as a possible Australian representative sprinter. He broke six records in winning two events at the 1977 Western Australian Championships. He swam the 100 m freestyle in 56.56 s, breaking the state records for 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds, before repeating the achievement in the 200 m backstroke. Still aged 14, he competed at his second Australian Championships and came fourth in the 100 m freestyle. In 1978, he came third in the 100 m freestyle and missed selection for the <a href="1978%20Commonwealth%20Games">1978 Commonwealth Games</a> in Edmonton, Canada by 0.03 s. He spent the rest of the year training and studying accounting at <a href="Leederville%20Technical%20College">Leederville Technical College</a>. During the year, Brooks set Australian age group records in the 200 m individual medley, the 200 m backstroke and the 100 m freestyle. At the inaugural Australian Short Course Championships in Launceston, Tasmania in 1979, he won silver in the 200 m individual medley and bronze in the 100 m freestyle. His performances earned him selection in the Australian team for the first time, competing in the <a href="FINA%20Swimming%20World%20Cup">FINA Swimming World Cup</a> event in Tokyo in April 1979, aged 16 years and nine months.

Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91 s in Perth in January 1980, breaking Tonelli's Australian record in the 100 m freestyle. As a result, he was invited to his first national training camp under <a href="Bill%20Sweetenham">Bill Sweetenham</a> for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100 m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100 m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80 s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4 × 100 m medley relay.

However, another obstacle arose with the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western World, led by the United States. The Australian <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> was also the patron of the <a href="Australian%20Olympic%20Committee">Australian Olympic Committee</a>, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.

The 4 × 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Brooks' Moscow campaign and it came only two days before his 18th birthday. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics">in 1960</a>, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia were regarded as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats; Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts boasted the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would place fourth a few days later. The British had <a href="Duncan%20Goodhew">Duncan Goodhew</a>, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. <a href="Peter%20Evans%20%28swimmer%29">Peter Evans</a> was the only individual medallist over a 100 m race, claiming bronze in the breaststroke. <a href="Mark%20Kerry">Mark Kerry</a> had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100 m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">Munich in 1972</a>. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its "de facto" leader. He asked his team-mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome as the "Quietly Confident Quartet", and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.

Kerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s. This left Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his team mates. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas. Upon returning to Australia, he was greeted as a hero, but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow. In 2000, Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Medal">Australian Sports Medal</a> for their victory in Moscow.

In the individual event, which occurred after the relay, Brooks had come equal first in his heat with eventual bronze medallist <a href="Per%20Johansson%20%28swimmer%29">Per Johansson</a> from <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> in a time of 52.11 s. This made him the seventh fastest qualifier for the semi-finals, but he suffered a severe asthma attack and had to be hospitalised. He swam the semi-final regardless, despite having a heart-rate before the start of race of 120, compared to his usual 72. He finished seventh in a time of 52.70 s, which saw him place 14th, missing the final by 0.83 s.

Brooks suffered from a lack of motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">Australian Institute of Sport</a> by swimming coaches <a href="Bill%20Sweetenham">Bill Sweetenham</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Pursley">Dennis Pursley</a>, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director <a href="Don%20Talbot">Don Talbot</a>, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100 m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61 s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> to train under <a href="Sam%20Freas">Sam Freas</a>. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that "In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in your room. In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach." The <a href="short%20course">shortcourse pools</a> used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50 m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50 m and 100 m freestyle double in the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a>, and was fourth in the 100 m freestyle at the 1981 <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100 m freestyle at the AACC Championships to <a href="Rowdy%20Gaines">Rowdy Gaines</a>, who went on to win the event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

Despite his successes in America, the <a href="Swimming%20Australia">Australian Swimming Union</a> did not offer to fund a return home for Brooks for the 1982 Australian Championships, but the University of Arkansas paid his fare as a reward for his performances in collegiate competition. Despite failing to defend his 100 m title, he qualified for the <a href="1982%20Commonwealth%20Games">1982 Commonwealth Games</a> in Brisbane. The team then went into a five-week training camp in the seaside Sydney suburb of South Coogee. The team resided at a migrant hostel, which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Brooks spoke out about the quality of the accommodation, leading officials to make improvements.

Brooks' protests against the accommodation was overshadowed by a much-publicised physical confrontation with a team official. He telephoned his coach in the United States to make return travel arrangements for the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. Due to the difference in time zones, he made his call after the team curfew, prompting team manager Jeff Hare to attempt to disconnect the line. After Hare threatened to expel him from the team, Brooks lost his temper and pinned the manager against the wall. The swimmer was summoned to a meeting with ASU officials the following day, where he remained unrepentant. He received a one-month ban, effective after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. Brooks demanded that if the ASU were to suspend him, they should do so immediately for the Commonwealth Games, rather than letting him compete and win medals before punishing him. His complaints about the training conditions had gained the attention of his team-mates, and several senior swimmers threatened to leave if he was banned. In the end, the ASU rescinded the suspension. Brooks has remained strongly critical of the attitude of swimming bureaucracy, claiming that "too many officials expect unquestioning obedience", calling for the formation of a swimmers' committee.

Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks and some of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, something that received much attention from the Australian public. He won his heat of the 100 m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09 s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14 s was enough to secure the gold medal in a close contest. Just 0.43 s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists <a href="Greg%20Fasala">Greg Fasala</a> and <a href="Michael%20Delany">Michael Delany</a>, both of Australia.

Brooks then won gold as part of the winning 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and <a href="Graeme%20Brewer">Graeme Brewer</a> to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56 s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the "Mean Machine". He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with <a href="David%20Orbell">David Orbell</a>, Evans and <a href="Jon%20Sieben">Jon Sieben</a>, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44 s. Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early changeover. After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.

Brooks came into the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite, but this time he was on the receiving end of a close result. He placed third in the 100 m freestyle behind <a href="Mark%20Stockwell">Mark Stockwell</a> and Delany, missing individual selection by 0.05 s. The trio was separated by a total of only 0.15 s. Selected as a relay swimmer only, he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, an event that the United States had always won.

During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell showed their intention to deny the Americans the gold for the first time at Olympic level. Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat, the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3 m 19.94 s. Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36 s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41 s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20 s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200 m freestyle silver medalist <a href="Mike%20Heath%20%28swimmer%29">Mike Heath</a> and 100 m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.

In the final, Australian coach <a href="Terry%20Buck">Terry Buck</a> switched the swimming order, putting Fasala as the leadoff leg, while the Americans brought in Heath and Gaines. Fasala's time of 51.00 s put the Australians second at the first change, behind the Americans, for whom <a href="Chris%20Cavanaugh%20%28swimmer%29">Chris Cavanaugh</a> had built a 0.17 s lead. After the first leg, the race was still close—0.90 s separated all the teams. Brooks completed his leg in 49.36 s, the fourth fastest in the race, 0.24 s faster than his American counterpart Heath, giving the Australians a slender 0.07 s lead at the halfway point. Australia and the United States had broken away from the field, which was now the best part of two seconds in arrears. However, the Australian lead was short-lived. <a href="Matt%20Biondi">Matt Biondi</a> took 0.59 s from Delany and Gaines took another 0.13 s from Stockwell, as the United States won in a world record time of 3 m 19.03 s. Australia were 0.65 s behind with Sweden a further 2.99 s in arrears. Brooks remained adamant that either he or Stockwell should have led off, stating that "the gold was there for the taking".

Brooks collected a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before being replaced by first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing in the third and final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, pulling out a 0.40 s margin over <a href="Tom%20Jager">Tom Jager</a>. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans and <a href="Glenn%20Buchanan">Glenn Buchanan</a> to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02 s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68 s, while the Americans sped up by 5.03 s.

In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100 m freestyle at the <a href="1985%20Australian%20Swimming%20Championships">Australian Championships</a>, clocking a time of 51.12 s. He then combined with <a href="Tom%20Stachewicz">Tom Stachewicz</a>, <a href="Paul%20Lee%20%28swimmer%29">Paul Lee</a> and <a href="Barry%20Armstrong%20%28swimmer%29">Barry Armstrong</a>, as Western Australia won the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100 m title, was selected for the <a href="1986%20Commonwealth%20Games">1986 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, where he came second to Fasala in the 100 m freestyle in a time of 51.01 s. He claimed gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and <a href="Matthew%20Renshaw">Matthew Renshaw</a>, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.

Brooks retired thereafter, moving to <a href="Nambour%2C%20Queensland">Nambour, Queensland</a> and starting a rock band called "The Union". He played the electric guitar, and also wrote his own music and songs. He also represented Western Australia in <a href="water%20polo">water polo</a> and <a href="indoor%20cricket">indoor cricket</a> and played <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> at district level.

Having graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in journalism in 1985, Brooks entered the media. Before his graduation, he had been a cadet with the <a href="Seven%20Network">Seven Network</a> in Perth for five years, reading the sports segment on the weekday evening news. He was a television commentator at the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics. Aside from covering the swimming and water polo, he also commentated on volleyball and in 1998, he called various downhill skiing events at the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">Nagano Winter Olympics</a>. Domestically, Brooks called <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> matches and read the sports segment on the weekday evening news for the Seven Network. For three years, he hosted "Brooksy's Footy Show", a Western Australian travel/holiday show called "Wild West", and in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics, co-hosted "The Games" with <a href="Tracey%20Holmes">Tracey Holmes</a>.

However, Brooks' career began to unravel in the late-1990s. He became addicted to alcohol, leading to a series of on-screen incidents. He once read the sports news segment while inebriated, and was then involved in a drunken argument with the <a href="Nine%20Network">Nine Network</a>'s Australian rules football pundit <a href="Sam%20Newman">Sam Newman</a>. In early 1999, Seven suspended Brooks from on-screen duties for six weeks after he made comments that they deemed to be "tasteless and offensive". In an interview with a magazine that had not been authorised by Seven, Brooks was asked what event he was looking forward to most at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> in Sydney, and replied "The after-Olympics piss-up". He was eventually sacked, denying him the opportunity to commentate on the swimming events and costing him an annual salary of AUD700,000.

In late 2000, Brooks was declared bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth after failing to repay a 14,941.64 debt to <a href="BankWest">BankWest</a>. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then announced that he would be leaving the state. Having moved to <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> in 2003, Brooks started "Local", which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist <a href="Peter%20FitzSimons">Peter FitzSimons</a> criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from <a href="Kieren%20Perkins">Kieren Perkins</a>, which was rendered thus in the publication: "I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [sic]." Brooks stood 200 cm and weighed 95 kg during his career, but in the early part of the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150 kg. As of 2007, he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems.

Brooks later became a partner in Nitro Energy Drink Company, which was involved in motorsport sponsorship. However, the firm suffered from financial trouble and he had a falling out with his business partner. In 2009, Brooks was removed from the board and the company was put into administration, and both he and his former partner have started legal proceedings.

Brooks' first marriage was to Lynette Quinlivan in January 1985. Their son <a href="Luke%20Quinlivan">Luke</a> is a member of the <a href="Australia%20men%27s%20national%20water%20polo%20team">Australian water polo team</a>, playing as a goalkeeper. In 2000, he married his third wife Elle.

On 13 October 2017 Linda Brooks was arrested in Perth after returning there from Bali. An extradition request to Queensland was granted. Police there wish to question her over an alleged fraud in 2008 relating to a sports clothing company which she was a director of. They also wish to question her husband Neil. On 13 November she is due to appear before a Brisbane magistrate’s court.

The World Is Not Enough (song)

"The World Is Not Enough" is the theme song from the <a href="The%20World%20Is%20Not%20Enough">eponymous</a> 1999 <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> film, performed by American-Scottish <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Garbage%20%28band%29">Garbage</a>. The song was written by composer <a href="David%20Arnold">David Arnold</a> (who also scored the film) and lyricist <a href="Don%20Black%20%28lyricist%29">Don Black</a>, previously responsible for four other <a href="James%20Bond%20music">Bond songs</a>, and was produced by Garbage and Arnold. "The World Is Not Enough" was composed in the style of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28film%20series%29">the series</a>' title songs, in contrast with the <a href="post-modern">post-modern</a> production and <a href="Crossover%20%28music%29">genre-hopping</a> of Garbage's first two albums. The group recorded most of "The World Is Not Enough" while <a href="Version%202.0%20tour">touring Europe</a> in support of their album "<a href="Version%202.0">Version 2.0</a>", telephoning Arnold as he recorded the orchestral backing in London before travelling to England. Garbage later finished recording and mixing the song at <a href="Armoury%20Studios">Armoury Studios</a> in Canada. The lyrics reflect the film's plot (told from the viewpoint of antagonist Elektra King), with themes of world domination and seduction.

The song and its <a href="The%20World%20Is%20Not%20Enough%20%28soundtrack%29">accompanying soundtrack</a> were released internationally by <a href="Radioactive%20Records">Radioactive Records</a> when the film premiered worldwide at the end of November 1999. "The World Is Not Enough" was praised by reviewers; it reached the top forty of ten singles charts and the top ten of four. It was included on the James Bond compilation "<a href="The%20Best%20of%20Bond...James%20Bond%232008%20release">The Best of Bond... James Bond</a>" and Garbage's <a href="greatest%20hits">greatest hits</a> album, "<a href="Absolute%20Garbage">Absolute Garbage</a>".

In September 1998 <a href="Michael%20G.%20Wilson">Michael G. Wilson</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Broccoli">Barbara Broccoli</a>, owners of <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> and long-time producers of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28films%29">James Bond films</a>, chose David Arnold to compose the <a href="Film%20score">score</a> for the nineteenth Bond movie (scheduled for release in November of the following year). Arnold composed the score for "<a href="Tomorrow%20Never%20Dies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a>", the previous film, and oversaw the recording of "" (an album of <a href="cover%20versions">cover versions</a> recorded by contemporary artists including <a href="Pulp%20%28band%29">Pulp</a>, <a href="Aimee%20Mann">Aimee Mann</a> and <a href="David%20McAlmont">David McAlmont</a>). Arnold and the film's <a href="production%20team">production team</a> wanted an early rough draft of the song so elements of its melody could be incorporated into the main score. Director <a href="Michael%20Apted">Michael Apted</a> thought the use of "<a href="Nobody%20Does%20It%20Better">Nobody Does It Better</a>" as a love theme throughout "<a href="The%20Spy%20Who%20Loved%20Me%20%28film%29">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>" very effective, and he wanted Arnold to use that as a reference point.

Arnold wanted a theme song marrying the "classic Bond sound" with the <a href="electronica">electronica</a> that would influence most of his score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them "The World Is Not Enough" would be seen as a generic <a href="action%20movie">action movie</a>. Getting the balance right might be a "<a href="poisoned%20chalice">poisoned chalice</a>", since the results could sound too much or too little like a Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist <a href="Don%20Black%20%28lyricist%29">Don Black</a> on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to <a href="Tom%20Jones%20%28singer%29">Tom Jones</a>'s "<a href="Thunderball%20%28soundtrack%29">Thunderball</a>", <a href="Shirley%20Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a>'s "<a href="Diamonds%20Are%20Forever%20%28soundtrack%29">Diamonds Are Forever</a>", <a href="Lulu%20%28singer%29">Lulu's</a> "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Golden%20Gun%20%28soundtrack%29">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>" and <a href="k.d.%20lang">k.d. lang</a>'s <a href="closing%20credits">closing credits</a> theme, "<a href="Tomorrow%20Never%20Dies%20%28soundtrack%29">Surrender</a>", from "Tomorrow Never Dies". Arnold and Black met several times to discuss lyrics for "The World Is Not Enough", also collaborating by phone, fax and email. According to Arnold, he "strung some la-las together, and all of a sudden the [song] came to life". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> (a contrasting section of about eight <a href="Bar%20%28music%29">bars</a>).

The lyrics are from the viewpoint of <a href="Elektra%20King">Elektra King</a>, the <a href="Bond%20girl">Bond girl</a> revealed as the mastermind of the villainous scheme. Its underlying themes are seduction and domination, described by Arnold as "a steel fist in a velvet glove. It beckons you in with its crooked finger." Black added that although the lyrics reflected the film's plot, they were "of course all about world domination" and "a lot more personal and intense", evoking a "ballady and dramatic" mood. A line of dialogue from the film, "There's no point in living if you can't feel alive," was included in the lyrics.

That month Arnold offered the theme to Garbage lead singer <a href="Shirley%20Manson">Shirley Manson</a>, who was very enthusiastic; Arnold said he "never heard someone screaming down the phone". A week later he sent the band the rough demo, which they approved. Manson requested a small change in the lyrics, disliking the line "I know when to kiss and I know when to kill", so Arnold and Black changed "I" to "we" for the final version.

Garbage drummer and co-producer <a href="Butch%20Vig">Butch Vig</a> said that when the group contributed to film soundtracks, "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." Manson called herself a fan of the series, "an institution I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child", and the films had a "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, like original Bond <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>, "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts "something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into."

At the beginning of August Garbage's involvement was confirmed in a <a href="press%20release">press release</a> from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record label, which would release the soundtrack and the single. Although "<a href="Music%20Week">Music Week</a>" reported that <a href="Jamiroquai">Jamiroquai</a>, <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>, <a href="Sharleen%20Spiteri">Sharleen Spiteri</a>, <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a> and <a href="Melanie%20C">Melanie C</a> were rejected by the producers before Garbage was chosen, Arnold denied that the other artists had auditioned; the single was suitable only for a film, and was not created with a particular artist in mind.

The first recordings were made during the European leg of Garbage's <a href="Version%202.0%20tour">Version 2.0 world tour</a>. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio from a number of European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's <a href="String%20section">string arrangement</a> in London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's <a href="Metropolis%20Group%23Studios">Metropolis Studios</a>.

Garbage flew to London for a day to record the <a href="multitrack%20recording">basic tracks</a>, laying down electric guitar, bass guitar and Manson's vocals with the orchestra. Manson called working with the orchestra "exhilarating". That night, the band flew to Switzerland to resume their tour for three weeks. 

The final recording was made in August at <a href="Armoury%20Studios">Armoury Studios</a> in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement tight to preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. "The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamically</a>," keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. "Besides the drums and bass and some <a href="percussion">percussive</a> <a href="Music%20loop">loops</a>, there's a little bit of guitar that <a href="Duke%20Erikson">Duke</a> and <a href="Steve%20Marker">Steve</a> did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing." Although Garbage owned <a href="Smart%20Studios">its own recording studio</a> in <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a>, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. "The World Is Not Enough" was completed, <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> and <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastered</a> at the end of the month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the "chilled-out remix") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, "We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song." However, Manson noted that the version featured in the film “got our hopes and joys squashed,” as “they had completely screwed with all the stems of mix and it sounded completely different.” 

Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music</a> and <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> over "The World Is Not Enough", alleging that it derived from their song "This Game We Play", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of "<a href="The%20Thomas%20Crown%20Affair%20%281999%20film%29">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>". Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in "The World Is Not Enough" which they alleged was identical to part of "This Game We Play". When the songwriters were gathering <a href="evidence">evidence</a>, one posed as an employee of composer <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> to contact Don Black and solicit his services for "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Eleven%20%282001%20film%29">Ocean's Eleven</a>". They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed "The World Is Not Enough", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.

The case was argued in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Middle%20District%20of%20Tennessee">United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee</a> in June 2004. The court rejected the <a href="plaintiffs">plaintiffs</a>' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed "The World Is Not Enough" and it did not share a passage with "This Game We Play". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to "This Game We Play" after journal entries, delivery <a href="invoice">invoice</a>s, telephone and computer records, written declarations from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and <a href="Deposition%20%28law%29">testimony</a> from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a> provided "irrefutable evidence" that "The World Is Not Enough" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the "three-note motif" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that "This Game We Play" was submitted to MGM.

 The music video for "The World Is Not Enough" was <a href="music%20video%20director">directed</a> by <a href="Philipp%20St%C3%B6lzl">Philipp Stölzl</a> for Oil Factory Films and filmed on a London <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a> on September 23–24, 1999. Manson's android shots (the laboratory, kissing and driving scenes) were filmed on the first day, with the <a href="Pyrotechnics">pyrotechnic</a> scenes shot on the second. For her "death", Manson kissed a lookalike model. The <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>'s <a href="Senate%20House%20%28University%20of%20London%29">Senate House</a> was the exterior for the fictional New Globe Theatre. <a href="Post-production">Post-production</a> and editing were completed two weeks later.

In the video (set in 1964) terrorists build an <a href="Android%20%28robot%29">android</a> replica of Shirley Manson, who can kill her targets with a kiss, on an unnamed <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific island</a>. The android is fitted with a <a href="bomb">bomb</a>, primed before it leaves on its mission. The android makes its way to Chicago's New Globe Theater and lets itself into Shirley Manson's <a href="Changing%20room">dressing room</a>, killing Manson and assuming her identity to perform the <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> of a song on a large steel globe. As the android and the band receive a <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a> from the audience, the bomb counts down. Smiling, the android Manson thrusts its arms in the air; the screen blacks out as the timer reaches zero, and an explosion is heard.

The video's filming was documented by a "<a href="Making%20the%20Video">Making the Video</a>" camera crew, and premiered on <a href="MTV">MTV</a> after the program on October 20, 1999; it debuted in the United Kingdom and on "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" the following day. A version of the video featuring footage from the film was shown in some countries; to preserve the video's <a href="narrative">narrative</a>, the film footage appeared on a <a href="Split%20screen%20%28filmmaking%29">split screen</a>. "The World Is Not Enough" video was included on the film's 2000 DVD release and Garbage's 2007 <a href="Greatest%20hits%20album">greatest-hits</a> DVD compilation, "<a href="Absolute%20Garbage%23Absolute%20Garbage%20DVD">Absolute Garbage</a>".

In North America, Radioactive distributed both versions of "The World Is Not Enough" to <a href="Adult%20album%20alternative">AAA</a>, alternative, <a href="Adult%20contemporary%20music">modern adult</a> and <a href="modern%20rock">modern rock</a> radio stations on October 4, 1999. Originally planned for introduction a week later, the radio date was moved up when a Los Angeles station broadcast a <a href="ripping">ripped</a>, <a href="bit-rate">low-quality</a> <a href="MP3%20file">MP3</a> of the Chilled Out remix circulated on <a href="file-sharing">file-sharing</a> networks early. The single's release coincided with Garbage's return to North America to headline an MTV-sponsored Campus Invasion Tour. The band introduced "The World Is Not Enough" on October 20 during a concert at the <a href="University%20of%20Denver">University of Denver</a>. On November 1, Garbage performed the song live on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>".

Radioactive released "The World Is Not Enough" in the United Kingdom on November 15 as a limited-edition <a href="digipak">digipak</a> CD single and a cassette single. Both formats were <a href="B-side">backed with</a> "Ice Bandits", an orchestral track from the David Arnold film score. The CD also included a remix produced by <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> act <a href="Unkle">Unkle</a>. After one week, "The World Is Not Enough" debuted at number 11 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, Garbage's 10th top-40 single. It remained on the UK chart for nine weeks. In Ireland, "The World Is Not Enough" peaked at number 30.

The song's music video was aired before the November 11 worldwide live broadcast of the <a href="1999%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>. MTV heavily promoted the film during the awards, giving away a <a href="BMW%20Z8">BMW Z8</a> (Bond's car in the film and Shirley Manson's in the video). Radioactive released the single in Europe from November 15 to December 6 as a three-track CD digipak and a two-track card-sleeve single, backed with "Ice Bandits".

"The World Is Not Enough" debuted at number 54 in Sweden at number seven in Norway, and number 10 in Finland, where it peaked at number seven in its second week. In the Netherlands the single debuted at number 74, rising to number 48 two weeks later. It debuted at number 55 in France and number 12 in Belgium's <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>. In December the song debuted at number 40 in Austria, remaining there for four weeks. It debuted at number 22 in Switzerland, rising to number 16 four weeks later at the beginning of January 2000. At the end of December, the song debuted at number 18 in Italy before peaking at number six in February 2000. Also in December, "The World Is Not Enough" peaked at number 38 in Germany and number 12 in Spain.

Radioactive followed the single with "The World Is Not Enough"s soundtrack album, featuring "Ice Bandits" and "Only Myself to Blame" (a second David Arnold-Don Black composition, sung by <a href="Scott%20Walker%20%28singer%29">Scott Walker</a> during the <a href="end%20credits">end credits</a>). The album was released in North America on November 9, and then internationally. "The World Is Not Enough" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of Garbage's third album, "<a href="Beautiful%20Garbage">Beautiful Garbage</a>", and was remastered for "<a href="Absolute%20Garbage">Absolute Garbage</a>". It was also included in three editions of the <a href="James%20Bond%20music">James Bond music</a> compilation "<a href="The%20Best%20of%20Bond...James%20Bond">The Best of Bond...James Bond</a>": in 2002, 2008 and 2012.

"The World Is Not Enough" received mainly positive reviews from music critics. "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" magazine noted that "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever-burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem." A "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" reviewer wrote that the song "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited", while <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song". <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> called the song a "top-notch Bond theme", following the Shirley Bassey template. In a "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" review, Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song "rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus we have come to expect ... the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint. [It is] not only the best 007 theme in eons, it is a great Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked "The World Is Not Enough" ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs: "Shirley Manson's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's sweeping symphonics."

Negative reviews revolved around the theme's classic Bond sound. <a href="LAUNCHcast">LAUNCHcast</a>'s James Poletti called the song a "perfectly competent Bond theme", but "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps they would have done better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" stated, "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" In its review of "Absolute Garbage", <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> called the song a "predictable '<a href="Goldfinger%20%28song%29">Goldfinger</a>' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics."

The song appeared in two "best of 1999" radio-station polls: number 87 in <a href="89X">89X</a>'s Top 89 Songs of 1999 and number 100 in <a href="WKQX%20%28FM%29">Q101</a>'s Top 101 of 1999. In 2012 <a href="Grantland">Grantland</a> ranked "The World Is Not Enough" the second-best Bond song of all time, behind "Goldfinger".

In 2002, "The World Is Not Enough" was covered by Canadian singer <a href="Diana%20Krall">Diana Krall</a> for "The Songs of Bond", a UK television special. Four years later <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>ian <a href="M%C3%BCsl%C3%BCm%20G%C3%BCrses">Müslüm Gürses</a> covered the song on his album "Aşk Tesadüfleri Sever (Love Loves Coincidences)". The song was re-arranged with Turkish lyrics and re-titled "Bir Ömür Yetmez (A Life Is Not Enough)".

In 2017, <a href="Chris%20Collingwood">Chris Collingwood</a>, lead singer of <a href="Fountains%20of%20Wayne">Fountains of Wayne</a>, recorded the song with his new band, Look Park, for the multi-artist compilation album, "Songs, Bond Songs: The Music Of 007".

<doc id="2326978" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2326978" title="Nominative determinism">
Nominative determinism

Nominative determinism is the <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that people tend to gravitate towards <a href="vocation">areas of work</a> that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting <a href="surname">surname</a>s. These included a book on polar explorations by <a href="Daniel%20Snowman">Daniel Snowman</a> and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation that some sort of psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in "New Scientist", as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept <a href="aptronym">aptronym</a>, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. "Aptronym" merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.

The idea that people are drawn to professions that fit their name was suggested by psychologist <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, citing as an example <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> who studied pleasure and whose surname means "joy". A few recent empirical studies have indicated that certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is "<a href="implicit%20egotism">implicit egotism</a>", which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is <a href="genetic%20determinism">genetic</a>: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.

Before people could gravitate towards areas of work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work. The way people are named has changed over time. In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name – for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard. Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as <a href="nickname">nickname</a>s. In England it was only after the <a href="Norman%20conquest">Norman conquest</a> that surnames were added, although there were a few earlier <a href="Epithet">bynames</a> that were not hereditary, such as <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a>. Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from <a href="patronymic">patronyms</a> (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), <a href="occupational%20name">occupational descriptions</a> (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton). Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so. Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations. The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers: an early example from the 14th century is "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".

Another aspect of naming was the importance attached to the wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England it was believed that choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names. In 1652 <a href="William%20Jenkyn">William Jenkyn</a>, an English clergyman, argued that first names should be "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master". In 1623, at a time when <a href="Puritans">Puritan</a> names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> wrote that names should be chosen with "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions. With the rise of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained. When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the "<a href="Kentish%20Note%20Book">Kentish Note Book</a>" magazine a list appeared with "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff". Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term "<a href="aptronym">aptronym</a>" is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist <a href="Franklin%20Pierce%20Adams">Franklin P. Adams</a>. Linguist Frank Nuessel coined "aptonym", without an "r", in 1992. Other synonyms include "euonym", "Perfect Fit Last Name" (PFLN), and "namephreak". In <a href="literary%20science">literary science</a> a name that particularly suits a character is called a "charactonym". Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> (e.g., <a href="Gradgrind">Mr. Gradgrind</a>, the tyrannical schoolmaster) and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> (e.g., the lost baby <a href="Perdita%20%28The%20Winter%27s%20Tale%29">Perdita</a> in "<a href="The%20Winter%27s%20Tale">The Winter's Tale</a>"). Sometimes this is played for laughs, as with the character <a href="Major%20Major%20Major%20Major">Major Major Major Major</a> in <a href="Joseph%20Heller">Joseph Heller</a>'s "<a href="Catch-22">Catch-22</a>", who was named Major Major Major by his father as a joke and then was later in life promoted to <a href="major">major</a> by "an <a href="IBM">IBM</a> machine with a sense of humor almost as keen as his father's." Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.

Because of the potentially humorous nature of aptronyms a number of newspapers have collected them. "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" columnist <a href="Herb%20Caen">Herb Caen</a> reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a>'s spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong. Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>": a food industry consultant named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab. "<a href="Bloomberg%20News">Bloomberg News</a>" reported that the <a href="investment%20bank">investment bank</a> <a href="Morgan%20Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> once had a trader called Morgan Stanley. A Dutch newspaper "<a href="Het%20Parool">Het Parool</a>" had an irregularly featured column called "Nomen est omen" with Dutch examples. Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms. <a href="Onomastics">Onomastic</a> scholar R.M. Rennick called for more verification of aptronyms appearing in newspaper columns and books. Lists of aptronyms in science, medicine, and law are more reliable as they tend to be drawn from easily verifiable sources.

Nominative determinism, literally "name-driven outcome", is the <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work which reflect their names. The name fits because people, possibly subconsciously, made themselves fit. Nominative determinism differs from the concept of aptronyms in that it focuses on causality.

The term has its origin in the "Feedback" column of the British magazine "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" in 1994. A series of events raised the suspicion of its editor, John Hoyland, who wrote in the 5 November issue:

Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness subsequently adopted the term "nominative determinism" as suggested by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term first appeared in the 17 December issue. Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since, readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a>, one Lieutenant Mike Kafka; authors of the book "The Imperial Animal" Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox; and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.

As used in "New Scientist" the term nominative determinism only applies to work. In contributions to other newspapers "New Scientist" writers have stuck to this definition, with the exception of editor Roger Highfield in a column in the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>", in which he included "key attributes of life".

Prior to 1994 other terms for the suspected psychological effect were used sporadically. "Onomastic determinism" was used as early as 1970 by <a href="Roberta%20Frank">Roberta Frank</a>. German psychologist <a href="Wilhelm%20Stekel">Wilhelm Stekel</a> spoke of "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" (the obligation of the name) in 1911. Outside of science, "cognomen syndrome" was used by playwright <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> in his 1972 play "<a href="Jumpers%20%28play%29">Jumpers</a>". In <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a> the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a sign. This saying is still in use today in English and other languages such as French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Slovenian.

"New Scientist" coined the term "nominative contradeterminism" for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine, would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently changed his name to Jirgensohn, and the Archbishop of Manila, <a href="Jaime%20Sin">Cardinal Sin</a>. The synonym "inaptronym" is also sometimes used.

The first scientists to discuss the concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists. Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the "obligation of the name" in the context of compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation; <a href="Karl%20Abraham">Karl Abraham</a> wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then try to live up to their names in some way. In 1952 <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> referred to Stekel's work in his theory of <a href="synchronicity">synchronicity</a> (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related):

Jung listed striking instances among psychologists—including himself: "Herr <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freud</a> (Joy) champions the <a href="Beyond%20the%20Pleasure%20Principle">pleasure principle</a>, Herr <a href="Gerhard%20Adler">Adler</a> (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth ..."

In 1975 psychologist Lawrence Casler called for empirical research into the relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish if there is an effect at work or whether we are being "seduced by <a href="Fortuna">Lady Luck</a>". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.

In 2002 the researchers Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing that people have a basic desire to feel good about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the <a href="self">self</a>. Given the "<a href="endowment%20effect">mere ownership effect</a>", which states that people like things more if they own them, the researchers theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power "<a href="implicit%20egotism">implicit egotism</a>". Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.

Those with fitting names give differing accounts of the effect of their name on their career choices. <a href="Igor%20Judge">Igor Judge</a>, former <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales</a>, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said "That had never occurred to me." <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers had anything to do with him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".

While reports by owners of fitting names are of interest, some scientists have questioned their value in deciding whether nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, they argue that the claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham "et al." for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham "et al." to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.

Aware of Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.

In 2009 Michalos reported the results of an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the low frequency of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.

In 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the <a href="General%20Medical%20Council">General Medical Council</a>, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an <a href="orthopedic%20surgery">orthopaedic surgeon</a>, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were <a href="genitourinary%20medicine">genitourinary medicine</a> (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and <a href="urology">urology</a> (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). <a href="Neurology">Neurologists</a> had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, "doc", "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be <a href="radiology">radiologists</a> than <a href="dermatology">dermatologists</a>.

As for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.

Boise National Forest

Boise National Forest is a <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forest</a> covering of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. Created on July 1, 1908, from part of <a href="Sawtooth%20National%20Forest">Sawtooth National Forest</a>, it is managed by the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> as five units: the <a href="Cascade%2C%20Idaho">Cascade</a>, <a href="Emmett%2C%20Idaho">Emmett</a>, <a href="Idaho%20City%2C%20Idaho">Idaho City</a>, <a href="Lowman%2C%20Idaho">Lowman</a>, and <a href="Mountain%20Home%2C%20Idaho">Mountain Home</a> <a href="park%20ranger">ranger</a> districts.

The <a href="Idaho%20Batholith">Idaho Batholith</a> underlies most of Boise National Forest, forming the forest's <a href="Boise%20Mountains">Boise</a>, <a href="Salmon%20River%20Mountains">Salmon River</a>, and <a href="West%20Mountains">West</a> mountain ranges; the forest reaches a maximum elevation of on <a href="Steel%20Mountain">Steel Mountain</a>. Common land cover includes <a href="sagebrush%20steppe">sagebrush steppe</a> and <a href="spruce-fir%20forests">spruce-fir forests</a>; there are of streams and rivers and of lakes and reservoirs. Boise National Forest contains 75 percent of the known populations of <a href="Lewisia%20sacajaweana">Sacajawea's bitterroot</a>, a flowering plant <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to Idaho.

The <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> people occupied the forest before European <a href="Oregon%20pioneer%20history">settlers arrived</a> in the early 19th century. Many of the early settlers were <a href="animal%20trapping">trappers</a> and <a href="prospecting">prospectors</a> before <a href="Gold%20mining%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Idaho">gold was discovered</a> in 1862. After the 1860s Boise Basin gold rush ended, mining of <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, silver, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, and gold continued in the forest until the mid-twentieth century. Recreation facilities include over 70 campgrounds, <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> and <a href="canoeing">flatwater</a> boating, cabin rentals, and of trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and motorized off-road vehicle use. The Forest Service has an objective to maintain timber, range, water, recreation, and wildlife for <a href="Multiple-Use%20Sustained-Yield%20Act%20of%201960">multiple use and sustained yield</a> of its resources.

Archaeological evidence indicates that human habitation in Idaho began towards the end of the <a href="last%20glacial%20maximum">last ice age</a>: bone fragments about 10,000 years old have been found in <a href="Wilson%20Butte%20Cave">Wilson Butte Cave</a>, an <a href="Lava%20cave%23Types">inflationary cave</a> on the <a href="Snake%20River%20Plain">Snake River Plain</a> believed to have been occupied by indigenous people until as recently as the 17th century. A change of climate around 7000 years ago dried up much of the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>, forcing the <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> people northward into the mountainous areas of central Idaho. Most of what is now Boise National Forest was sparsely inhabited by Native Americans, and several archaeological sites, including campsites, rock shelters, burial grounds, and <a href="pictogram">pictographs</a> have been found along rivers in the area. Trappers and fur traders of European descent first arrived in the area in the early 1800s, starting with <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor">John Jacob Astor</a>'s <a href="Pacific%20Fur%20Company">Pacific Fur Company</a> in October 1811. <a href="Donald%20Mackenzie%20%28explorer%29">Donald Mackenzie</a> and <a href="Francois%20Payette">Francois Payette</a> trapped in the area of Boise National Forest in 1819. By 1840, the fur trade was coming to an end, but the westward migration on the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>, which passed south of the forest, was beginning. The first settlers moved into the mountains in the 1860s after <a href="gold">gold</a> was discovered in Idaho, which forced many of the Shoshone out and led to conflicts throughout the state, including the <a href="Bannock%20War">Bannock War</a> in southern Idaho.

Prospectors George Grimes and Moses Splawn were the first to discover gold in the forest at the eponymous Grimes Creek on August 2, 1862. Subsequent gold discoveries at Rocky Bar in 1863 and <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Idaho">Atlanta</a> in 1864 increased the rush of people to Idaho, and in 1863 Idaho City, with a population of 6,267, surpassed <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> as the largest city in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. The Idaho gold rush was largely over by 1870, and the population of the Boise Basin fell from 16,000 to 3,500. In 1898 the forest's first <a href="gold%20dredge">gold dredge</a> was built in <a href="Placerville%2C%20Idaho">Placerville</a> and followed by several others. By 1951, when the last dredges shut down, at least 2.3 million ounces (65.2 million grams) of gold had been produced from the Boise Basin area. <a href="Silver">Silver</a> was mined along the Crooked River from 1882 until 1921, but a silver mine at Silver Mountain proved unsuccessful. Following a shortage of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, mines in the Stibnite area became the country's largest producer of <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> and second largest source of mercury. The most important known <a href="placer%20mining">placer</a> deposit of <a href="niobium">niobium</a> and <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a> in the United States is located in Bear Valley. From 1953 until 1959, dredges there produced $12.5 million ($ today) in niobium, tantalum, and <a href="uranium">uranium</a>. Other minerals mined in the forest include <a href="antimony">antimony</a> and <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>.

Boise National Forest was created on July 1, 1908, from part of <a href="Sawtooth%20National%20Forest">Sawtooth National Forest</a>, and originally covered . By the <a href="Forest%20Reserve%20Act%20of%201891">Forest Reserve Act of 1891</a>, the U.S. Congress granted the U.S. President the authority to establish forest reserves out of Public Domain Lands that were subject to disposal (homesteads, sales, etc.) administered by the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a>, which had been placed under the authority of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. Department of the Interior</a> in 1849. With the passage of the <a href="Transfer%20Act%20of%201905">Transfer Act of 1905</a>, forest reserves were transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> in the newly created <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a>. Present-day Boise National Forest was first protected as part of two forest reserves by proclamations issued by President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>: Sawtooth Forest Reserve (created on May 29, 1905, and expanded on November 6, 1906) and Payette Forest Reserve (created on June 3, 1905). After forest reserves were renamed <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">national forests</a> in 1908, Boise National Forest was split from Sawtooth National Forest into an independent national forest. On April 1, 1944, the entirety of what was then Payette National Forest was transferred to Boise National Forest, and simultaneously <a href="Weiser%20National%20Forest">Weiser</a> and <a href="Idaho%20National%20Forest">Idaho</a> national forests were combined to reestablish the present-day <a href="Payette%20National%20Forest">Payette National Forest</a>, which is to the north of Boise National Forest. In 1933 the Boise Basin Experimental Forest was created on of the forest near Idaho City to study the management of <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pine</a>. The Lucky Peak Nursery was established in 1959 to produce trees for planting on burned or logged lands on the national forests of the <a href="USDA%20Forest%20Service%2C%20Region%202">Intermountain region</a>.

After the creation of the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) in 1933, nine camps and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, but the number of camps was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942. Work conducted by the CCC included fire suppression, fish habitat improvement, and construction of guard houses, fire lookouts, campgrounds, roads, and trails, among other facilities.

Boise National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, as five units called ranger districts. The ranger districts are <a href="Cascade%2C%20Idaho">Cascade</a> (), <a href="Emmett%2C%20Idaho">Emmett</a> (), <a href="Idaho%20City%2C%20Idaho">Idaho City</a> (400,000 acres), <a href="Lowman%2C%20Idaho">Lowman</a> (400,000 acres), and <a href="Mountain%20Home%2C%20Idaho">Mountain Home</a> (); each has an office in their respective cities and is managed by a district ranger, while forest headquarters are located in the city of <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise</a>. <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> proclaimed of Idaho part of Boise National Forest, but the forest manages only . The proclaimed boundary is set and can only be changed by Congress whereas the administered boundary can be shifted among adjacent national forests without congressional approval. For management (and from the visitor's perspective) the forest's boundaries are its administered area.

Elevations in the forest range from in the North Fork Payette River Canyon to at the top of <a href="Steel%20Mountain">Steel Mountain</a>, a gain of . The forest contains several subranges of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, including the <a href="Boise%20Mountains">Boise</a>, <a href="Salmon%20River%20Mountains">Salmon River</a>, and <a href="West%20Mountains">West</a> mountain ranges. Much of the forest is underlain by the <a href="Idaho%20Batholith">Idaho Batholith</a>, and the forest is dominated by <a href="granite">granitic</a> rock, but intrusions of <a href="basalt">basalt</a> can be found to the west and other volcanic rocks to the south.

North of the South Fork Payette River and east of the North Fork Payette River, the forest is part of the Salmon River Mountains, which extend north and east outside the forest's boundaries. The South Fork Salmon River Range and the North Fork Range are subranges of the Salmon River Mountains within Boise National Forest. The Boise Mountains cover much of the southern portion of the forest and contain the forest's highest point, Steel Mountain, but the range's highest point, <a href="Two%20Point%20Mountain%20%28Idaho%29">Two Point Mountain</a>, lies outside of the forest's boundary. The Trinity Mountains are a subrange in southeastern part of the Boise Mountains that reach their peak at on <a href="Trinity%20Mountain%20%28Idaho%29">Trinity Mountain</a>. The westernmost portion of the forest south and west of Lake Cascade are part of the West Mountains, which reach their highest point at on <a href="Snowbank%20Mountain%20%28Idaho%29">Snowbank Mountain</a>. The Danskin Mountains are a smaller range on the forest's southern border that run northwest to southeast.

There are an estimated of perennial and intermittent streams and of lakes and reservoirs in the forest. The Forest Service provides access to and recreation opportunities at the seven reservoirs it borders, although it does not own or manage them. There are numerous natural lakes in the forest, most of which are <a href="tarn%20%28lake%29">tarns</a> created by alpine <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. The largest, <a href="Warm%20Lake">Warm Lake</a>, is 26 miles (42 km) east of Cascade in Valley County; many of the smaller lakes are in the Trinity and West mountains. Annual water yield on the forest is estimated at 4.1 million <a href="acre-foot">acre-feet</a> (5.1 × 10 m). The southern portion of the forest is drained by the Boise River, the central and western portions by the <a href="Payette%20River">Payette River</a>, northeastern portion by the <a href="Salmon%20River%20%28Idaho%29">Salmon River</a>, and far western portions of the Emmett Ranger District by the <a href="Weiser%20River">Weiser River</a>. All four rivers are tributaries of the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>, which itself is a tributary of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific basin</a>.

Daily high temperatures range from in winter to in summer, while lower elevations can experience conditions over . Idaho's mountain ranges can block Arctic air in the winter, but when cold air masses do enter the area, they sometimes stagnate in the Snake and Salmon river valleys, causing very cold temperatures to persist. Summer and fall are generally dry, while intense short-duration thunderstorms can occur in late spring and early summer as atmospheric moisture interacts with warm temperatures and steep topography via <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a>ing. During winter, warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean often brings rain at lower elevations in addition to snowfall throughout the forest. The influence of these Pacific maritime air masses increases as latitude increases in the forest. Average annual snowfall ranges from in drier areas and at lower elevations to in wetter locations and higher elevations. The growing season within the forest ranges from over 150 days in lower elevations to less than 30 days in alpine areas.

Boise National Forest is within the <a href="Idaho%20Batholith%20ecoregion">Idaho Batholith ecoregion</a>, which is a <a href="List%20of%20ecoregions%20in%20the%20United%20States%20%28EPA%29">level III</a> <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a> in the larger level I <a href="List%20of%20ecoregions%20in%20the%20United%20States%20%28EPA%29%23Northwestern%20Forested%20Mountains">Northwestern Forested Mountains</a>. In addition to species listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>, the Forest Service maintains an independent listing of sensitive species for which it is directed to "develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of Forest Service actions." As of February 2013 there were 27 species in Boise National Forest listed as sensitive species: 6 mammals, 1 amphibian, 1 fish, 13 birds, and 6 plants.

An estimated 76 percent of Boise National Forest is forest, which according to the Forest Service is considered land capable of supporting trees on at least 50 percent of its area. The forests are primarily <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a>s, dominated by <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> and <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa</a> and <a href="Pinus%20contorta">lodgepole</a> pines at lower elevations and <a href="Picea%20engelmannii">Engelmann spruce</a>, <a href="Abies%20lasiocarpa">subalpine fir</a>, and <a href="Pinus%20albicaulis">whitebark pine</a> at higher elevations. <a href="Abies%20grandis">Grand fir</a> and <a href="Larix%20occidentalis">western larch</a> (a coniferous <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> tree) grow in the northern part of the forest where there are moister conditions. <a href="Populus%20tremuloides">Quaking aspen</a>, a <a href="flowering%20plant">broadleaf</a> deciduous tree, grows both in stands among conifers and in <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> stands throughout the forest at elevations above . Non-forested areas occupy 23 percent of the forest, primarily on south-facing slopes, lower elevations in the forest's southern latitudes, or high-elevation areas and are dominated by <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="forb">forb</a>s, or <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s.

<a href="Lewisia%20sacajaweana">Sacajawea's bitterroot</a> is a plant species <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to central Idaho, including parts of Boise National Forest, being found nowhere else in the world. Only about two dozen populations of the plant are known to exist, and three-quarters of these are in Boise National Forest. It is usually found at elevations ranging from to above sea level and produces white flowers shortly after snowmelt.

Boise National Forest is directed by the U.S. Forest Service to "control the establishment, spread, or invasion of non-indigenous plant species in otherwise healthy native vegetative ecosystems." The forest's plan addresses the need to control <a href="invasive%20species">invasive plants</a>, and management efforts include chemical, mechanical, and biological <a href="Invasive%20species%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Reducing%20the%20spread%20of%20invasive%20species">control methods</a>. Invasive plants that are of particular concern in Boise National Forest include <a href="Centaurea%20maculosa">spotted knapweed</a>, <a href="Centaurea%20solstitialis">yellow star-thistle</a>, <a href="Chondrilla%20juncea">rush skeletonweed</a>, and <a href="Euphorbia%20esula">leafy spurge</a>, among others.

The warmest, driest forested areas occur on south-facing slopes from to . Due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires, ponderosa pine dominates these forests alongside Douglas fir. The <a href="understory">understory</a> consists of <a href="Pseudoroegneria%20spicata">bluebunch wheatgrass</a>, <a href="Festuca%20idahoensis">Idaho fescue</a>, <a href="Symphoricarpos%20oreophilus">mountain snowberry</a>, and <a href="Purshia">bitterbrush</a> in drier areas and <a href="Carex%20geyeri">elk sedge</a>, <a href="Calamagrostis%20rubescens">pinegrass</a>, <a href="Spiraea">white spirea</a>, <a href="Physocarpus%20malvaceus">mallow ninebark</a>, and <a href="Symphoricarpos">common snowberry</a> at higher elevations.

In cool, moist areas ranging from to , Douglas fir is predominant. Lodgepole pine and quaking aspen may be found alongside Douglas fir in cooler areas, both moist and dry, but particularly where <a href="frost%20pocket">frost pocket</a>s form. Understories in this forest type are dominated by <a href="Acer%20spicatum">mountain maple</a>, <a href="Sorbus%20scopulina">mountain ash</a>, and <a href="Vaccinium%20deliciosum">blue huckleberry</a> in moister areas and white spirea, common snowberry, elk sedge, and pinegrass in drier areas. Between and in the moist northern parts of the forest, grand fir is predominant and western larch is one of the first trees to become established during <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> following disturbances, whereas understories consist of mountain maple, mountain ash, blue huckleberry, and mallow ninebark. Subalpine fir dominates from to along with mountain maple, <a href="Amelanchier">serviceberry</a>, <a href="Salix%20scouleriana">Scouler's willow</a>, <a href="Sitka%20alder">Sitka alder</a>, <a href="menziesia">menziesia</a>, <a href="Lonicera%20utahensis">Utah honeysuckle</a>, and mountain ash.

Lodgepole pine dominates in cold, dry areas from to . The understory in lodgepole pine forests can be sparse but includes grasses, forbs, huckleberries, and <a href="Vaccinium%20scoparium">grouse whortleberry</a>, although fires in these forests are typically lethal to trees and understories alike. At the highest elevations, forests consist of subalpine fir alongside whitebark pine and Engelmann spruce. Grasses and forbs tolerant to freezing throughout the growing season occupy the understory.

<a href="Sagebrush">Sagebrush</a> typically dominates drier, non-forested areas at lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include <a href="Poa%20secunda">Sandberg bluegrass</a>, <a href="Allium">wild onion</a>, <a href="Astragalus">milk vetches</a>, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, <a href="Tetradymia%20canescens">gray horsebrush</a>, <a href="Chrysothamnus%20viscidiflorus">green rabbitbrush</a>, and others. In <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian</a> areas below , trees such as <a href="Populus%20trichocarpa">black cottonwood</a>, <a href="Populus%20angustifolia">narrowleaf cottonwood</a>, <a href="Alnus%20incana">thinleaf alder</a>, <a href="Betula%20occidentalis">water birch</a>, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including <a href="Aronia">chokeberry</a> and <a href="willow">willow</a>s. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, <a href="Dasiphora%20fruticosa">shrubby cinquefoil</a>, <a href="Chamerion%20angustifolium">fireweed</a>, <a href="Saxifraga">saxifrage</a>, and grasses.

Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 terrestrial vertebrate species and 28 fish species. The most common large animals are <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> and <a href="elk">elk</a>, but other mammals present include <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a>, <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>, <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="North%20American%20porcupine">porcupine</a>, <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canadian lynx</a>, <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a>, <a href="American%20pika">pika</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>, <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a>, <a href="American%20mink">mink</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="American%20marten">marten</a>, and <a href="northwestern%20wolf">timber wolves</a>.

Timber wolves are <a href="apex%20predator">top predators</a> that were <a href="wolf%20reintroduction">reintroduced</a> amidst controversy to central Idaho in the mid-1990s to restore ecosystem stability. The wolves have since expanded their range and established packs in most of Boise National Forest. Wolves and mountain lions are the forest's top large mammal predators and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the forest's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the exception of <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s, which have become <a href="local%20extinction">locally extinct</a>, and plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s but have not progressed.

Of the 28 fish species present in the forest, 11 are not native and have been introduced by humans. <a href="Columbia%20River%20redband%20trout">Rainbow trout</a>, <a href="chinook%20salmon">chinook salmon</a>, <a href="westslope%20cutthroat%20trout">westslope cutthroat trout</a>, <a href="bull%20trout">bull trout</a>, and <a href="mountain%20whitefish">mountain whitefish</a> are all native to some of the forest's waterways, while <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a> are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's <a href="Salmonidae">salmonids</a>. The forest's <a href="indicator%20species">management indicator species</a> is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. <a href="Sockeye%20salmon">Sockeye salmon</a> are native to the Salmon River watershed in the northern part of the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this <a href="fish%20migration">anadromous</a> fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the <a href="Idaho%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Game">Idaho Department of Fish and Game</a> stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a> and steelhead, the <a href="anadromous">anadromous</a> form of rainbow trout.

Over 270 bird species have been observed in central Idaho, including 36 accidental species – those that are not normally found in the region but have been observed on at least one occasion. <a href="Golden%20eagle">Golden eagle</a>s and <a href="greater%20sage-grouse">greater sage-grouse</a> can be found over sagebrush steppe, whereas <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s can be seen along rivers. The Forest Service has listed <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s, <a href="flammulated%20owl">flammulated owl</a>s, and <a href="white-headed%20woodpecker">white-headed woodpecker</a>s as a sensitive species in the forest.

The few amphibians present in the forest include the <a href="Tailed%20frog">Rocky Mountain tailed frog</a>, <a href="long-toed%20salamander">long-toed salamander</a>, and <a href="Columbia%20spotted%20frog">Columbia spotted frog</a>, which has been listed as a sensitive species. Common snakes include <a href="bullsnake">bullsnake</a>s, <a href="Western%20terrestrial%20garter%20snake">garter snakes</a>, and <a href="rubber%20boa">rubber boa</a>s.

Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan recognizes that fire and other <a href="disturbance%20%28ecology%29">disturbances</a> play important roles in maintaining the character and function of <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. However, <a href="History%20of%20wildfire%20suppression%20in%20the%20United%20States">previous management strategies</a> (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the <a href="Organic%20Act%20of%201897">Organic Act of 1897</a> explicitly stated that forests were to be protected from destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).

Between 2004 and 2013 an average of were burned by fires per year with a maximum of in 2007 and a minimum of in 2008. For example, in 2012 there were 26 fires started by people and 109 started by lightning, which together burned a total of . The Trinity Ridge Fire alone burned over two months, although it was not confined to Boise National Forest lands.

The revised 2010 forest plan recognized the need to develop plans to manage wildfires at the <a href="wildland%E2%80%93urban%20interface">wildland–urban interface</a>, use <a href="Controlled%20burn">prescribed fire</a> as a tool to manage ecosystem health, and meet air quality requirements set by the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Clean Air Act</a>. The forest operates a fire management plan under federal fire policy that gives fire personnel direction for responding to unintended ignitions. Occasionally, area closures and restrictions on use, such as prohibition of campfires, are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention. Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels. For instance, in 2014 Boise National Forest planned to conduct of prescribed burns and of mechanical treatment. The forest seasonally maintains staff at seven <a href="fire%20lookout%20tower">fire lookout tower</a>s, while six others remain unstaffed.

There are over 70 campgrounds in Boise National Forest and groups of more developed recreation facilities at the Trinity Mountains, Warm Lake, and Deadwood and Sage Hen reservoirs. As in most national forests, the majority of the land in Boise National Forest is open to dispersed camping (outside of developed campgrounds). One of the forest's fire lookouts, Deadwood Lookout, is now available as a cabin for the public to rent, among other sites. Bicycles are allowed on forest roads and on more than of multiple-use trails, whereas over of trails are open to motorized recreation. The Danskin Mountains Off-Highway Vehicle Trail System contains of motorcycle and ATV trails on of land that is generally open from April through November. The forest's Trinity Mountain Recreation Area includes the highest drivable (4-wheel drive recommended) road in Idaho, which ascends to the Trinity Mountain Lookout at an elevation of over . In 2013 revenues from recreation and special use fees amounted to $454,635, while expenses totaled ; the difference is allocated to the following season's startup costs.

Rivers in Boise National Forest offer the opportunity for <a href="rafting">rafting</a> and <a href="whitewater%20kayaking">kayaking</a> through rapids up to <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">class four</a>, with the most difficult sections on the South Fork and main stems of the Payette River. Numerous developed boat launch sites provide access to rivers for whitewater enthusiasts, and Dagger Falls is the primary launching site for visitors to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. Motorized boating is permitted on <a href="Anderson%20Ranch%20Dam">Anderson Ranch Reservoir</a>, <a href="Deadwood%20Reservoir">Deadwood Reservoir</a>, and <a href="Warm%20Lake">Warm Lake</a>.

During winter, visitors to the forest can participate in activities including <a href="snowmobile">snowmobiling</a>, <a href="snowshoe">snowshoe</a>ing, and <a href="Alpine%20skiing">downhill</a> and <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a>. The <a href="Bogus%20Basin">Bogus Basin</a> ski area is located within the forest north of Boise and has 7 chairlifts and 53 runs on of skiable terrain. There are of groomed snowmobile trails in the <a href="Garden%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Garden Valley</a> system in the Emmett Ranger District and several Mongolian-style <a href="yurt">yurt</a>s available for rental in winter.

Boise National Forest is home to three of Idaho's scenic byways, all of which are paved highways accessible to <a href="roadworthiness">roadworthy</a> vehicles. The Payette River Scenic Byway is an route between <a href="Eagle%2C%20Idaho">Eagle</a> and <a href="McCall%2C%20Idaho">McCall</a> on <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2055">Idaho State Highway 55</a>. The route follows the Payette River between McCall and <a href="Horseshoe%20Bend%2C%20Idaho">Horseshoe Bend</a>, but the majority of the highway does not pass through Boise National Forest; only a small portion north of Horseshoe Bend is in the Emmett Ranger District. Over half of the Wildlife Canyon Scenic Byway, which travels between highway 55 and Lowman, passes through the forest, parallels the South Fork of the Payette River, and is signed as the Banks-Lowman Road. The Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway is a road between <a href="Stanley%2C%20Idaho">Stanley</a> and Boise following <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2021">Idaho State Highway 21</a>. This route passes over Arrowrock Reservoir and through Idaho City and Lowman, where it connects with the Wildlife Canyon Byway. North and east of Lowman the byway partially follows the South Fork of the Payette River before ascending to the <a href="Banner%20Creek%20Summit">Banner Creek Summit</a> at the forest's boundary with Salmon-Challis National Forest.

Idlewild and Soak Zone

Idlewild and Soak Zone, commonly known as Idlewild Park or simply Idlewild, is a children's <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a> situated in the <a href="Laurel%20Highlands">Laurel Highlands</a> near <a href="Ligonier%2C%20Pennsylvania">Ligonier, Pennsylvania</a>, United States, about east of <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, along <a href="US%20Route%2030">US Route 30</a>. Founded in 1878 as a campground along the <a href="Ligonier%20Valley%20Railroad">Ligonier Valley Railroad</a> by <a href="Thomas%20Mellon">Thomas Mellon</a>, Idlewild is the oldest amusement park in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and the third oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind <a href="Lake%20Compounce">Lake Compounce</a> and <a href="Cedar%20Point">Cedar Point</a>. The park has won several awards, including from industry publication "<a href="Amusement%20Today">Amusement Today</a>" as the best children's park in the world.

The park was established by the prominent <a href="Mellon%20family">Mellon family</a> in 1878, and remained family-owned for over 100 years. It expanded greatly throughout the first half of the 20th century, adding rides including a <a href="Philadelphia%20Toboggan%20Company">Philadelphia Toboggan Company</a> <a href="Rollo%20Coaster">Rollo Coaster</a> in 1938, one of the company's earliest. The park is home to the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish athletic and cultural festival that has annually drawn over 10,000 spectators. In 1983, the park was purchased by <a href="Kennywood%20Entertainment%20Company">Kennywood Entertainment Company</a>, which oversaw additional expansion, including an attraction designed and voiced by <a href="Fred%20Rogers">Fred Rogers</a> based on his television show "<a href="Mister%20Rogers%27%20Neighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a>". Since 2008, the park, as well as others formerly under Kennywood Entertainment, have been owned by <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> company <a href="Parques%20Reunidos">Parques Reunidos</a> and operated by their American subsidiary <a href="Palace%20Entertainment">Palace Entertainment</a>.

On April 15, 1853, the <a href="Pennsylvania">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> granted a <a href="charter">charter</a> for a railroad to haul coal and timber between the towns of <a href="Ligonier%2C%20Pennsylvania">Ligonier</a> and <a href="Latrobe%2C%20Pennsylvania">Latrobe</a>. For nearly twenty years, Latrobe and Ligonier Rail Road Company performed no work on the railroad, and renewed their charter in 1866 and 1869. Following an additional renewal in 1871, the company changed its name to the <a href="Ligonier%20Valley%20Railroad">Ligonier Valley Railroad</a> and acquired a stretch of land. <a href="Land%20grading">Land grading</a> and bridge construction for the <a href="narrow%20gauge">narrow gauge</a> line was mostly completed by 1873.

In 1875, the partially constructed railway was sold at a <a href="sheriff%27s%20sale">sheriff's sale</a> after the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>, the Latrobe terminus of the line, declined to assume financial responsibility. <a href="Thomas%20Mellon">Thomas Mellon</a>, a retired <a href="Pennsylvania%20Courts%20of%20Common%20Pleas">Court of Common Pleas</a> judge from <a href="Allegheny%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny County</a>, purchased the Ligonier Valley Railroad at auction. Mellon had founded the <a href="Mellon%20Financial">T. Mellon and Sons Bank</a>, and was invested in coal, steel, oil, glassmaking, and other railroad ventures. In an effort to attract passengers, Mellon decided to offer recreational grounds along the route.

On May 1, 1878, William Darlington, landowner and namesake of the nearby village of <a href="Ligonier%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Darlington</a>, responded to Mellon's request to use his land:

The first structure, built that year, was a <a href="train%20station">train depot</a> measuring by . The depot was described as the smallest full-service station in the United States. Initial development of the land included camp sites, an artificial lake for fishing and boating, picnic tables, and a large hall. The railroad provided easy access to the site, attracting visitors from away in <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> and the surrounding areas for a getaway in the country. The "Ligonier Echo" noted that on <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">July 4</a>, 1890, the trains to the park were so crowded that the "tops of the coaches were covered with boys."

While the initial lease with Darlington confined the park to between the railroad and the north bank of the <a href="Loyalhanna%20Creek">Loyalhanna Creek</a>, permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to the south in the mid-1880s. Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam <a href="carousel">carousel</a> in the center of the park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a bicycle track around Lake Bouquet, a hiking trail on the lake's island, fishing in the Loyalhanna Creek, <a href="Watercraft%20rowing">rowboating</a>, and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities.
In 1931, Judge Mellon's son <a href="Richard%20B.%20Mellon">Richard B. Mellon</a>, brother of <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a>, and C. C. Macdonald acquired the park under a partnership known as the Idlewild Management Company. The first season under the financial support of Mellon and the management of Macdonald and his family brought electricity to the park, allowing for later operating hours and electric-powered rides, including a three-row <a href="Philadelphia%20Toboggan%20Company">Philadelphia Toboggan Company</a> carousel. The park also debuted a den of <a href="American%20Black%20Bear">black bears</a> that year. The bears were across the path from a cage of <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s, who escaped in 1932. Park management offered a reward of $3 each ($ each in 2019) for the return of the seven monkeys, believing that they had been set loose. R. Z. Macdonald later said that his father, C. C., was always amused and pleased with the publicity that the escape created, though he never formally accused his father.

The Macdonalds sought to maintain the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000 shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a <a href="The%20Whip%20%28ride%29">Whip</a>, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company <a href="Rollo%20Coaster">Rollo Coaster</a>. World War II and the resulting <a href="rationing">rationing</a> forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the <a href="Caterpillar%20ride">Caterpillar</a> and a small <a href="showboat">showboat</a> that sailed in Lake Bouquet.

The Macdonald family obtained complete ownership of the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a> had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, to <a href="Lincoln%20Park%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Lincoln Park</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030">U.S. Route 30</a>. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and a <a href="Gulf%20Oil">Gulf Oil</a> gas station, a <a href="Mellon%20Financial">Mellon</a> company, were added in the 1930s.

Under the Macdonalds, the park continued to expand. Kiddieland was constructed between 1954 and 1956, and featured many smaller version of rides meant for children. Some of the rides included miniature boats, a Ferris wheel, <a href="Doodlebug%20%28rail%20car%29">doodlebug</a>, and pony rides.

Clinton "Jack" Macdonald became president of the park in 1957. In 1959, Macdonald and Lewis Davidson, a <a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> director at the <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a>, started the <a href="%23Ligonier%20Highland%20Games">Ligonier Highland Games</a>, a <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="highland%20games">highland games</a> event held at the park. During the same year that he assumed control of the park, Macdonald was appointed as the first commissioner of the Scottish <a href="Clan%20Donald">Clan Donald</a> for Pennsylvania. The games, held annually in early September after the park had closed for the summer, became one of the largest and most highly regarded Scottish athletic and <a href="Culture%20of%20Scotland">cultural</a> competitions in the country. Jack Macdonald said of the Games: "We're not interested in becoming one of the biggest Games. We just want to be one of the nicest."

The park sustained heavy damage when the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> dropped of rain on the area in 24 hours in June 1972. Lake St. Clair and Lake Bouquet, merging in the resulting flood, caused significant damage to the boathouse. The flood lifted and twisted the park's Loyalhanna Limited Railroad, which required extensive repairs.

On January 27, 1983, <a href="Kennywood%20Entertainment%20Company">Kennywood Park Corporation</a> of <a href="West%20Mifflin%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Mifflin, Pennsylvania</a>, near Pittsburgh, bought the park from the Macdonald family for a reported price of $1.8 million.<a href="https%3A//news.google.com/newspapers%3Fid%3DOLMqAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DAmAEAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bdq%3Ddebartolo%26amp%3Bpg%3D1948%252C5547016"></a> Ironically, both Kennywood and Idlewild were founded as amusement parks by the <a href="Mellon%20family">Mellon family</a>. During the first winter, several changes occurred. Jumpin' Jungle, a children's play area, was added. Story Book Forest was no longer run as a separate operation and was merged with the rest of the park. What had been Historic Village was relocated and renamed.

As the popularity of <a href="waterpark">waterpark</a>s increased, the H20hhh Zone was added in 1985. In 1989, the park expanded across the <a href="Loyalhanna%20Creek">Loyalhanna Creek</a> by adding a <a href="tram">trolley</a> ride based on "<a href="Mister%20Rogers%27%20Neighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a>", a popular children's television show. The ride was designed and voiced by children's entertainer <a href="Fred%20Rogers">Fred Rogers</a>, a native of Latrobe. The area was expanded the following year to include Raccoon Lagoon, an area for children. A <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a>, <a href="Tilt-A-Whirl">Tilt-A-Whirl</a> and a water raft ride were added by the end of the 1980s, along with games, new food stands and restaurants.

The 1990s brought the addition of the <a href="Wild%20Mouse%20%28Idlewild%29">Wild Mouse</a>, the only <a href="Wild%20Mouse%20roller%20coaster">Wild Mouse roller coaster</a> designed by Dutch company <a href="Vekoma">Vekoma</a>. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at <a href="Wiener%20Prater">Wiener Prater</a> in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Alton%20Towers">Alton Towers</a> in <a href="England">England</a>, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, <a href="lumberjack">lumberjack</a> and <a href="acrobatics">acrobatics</a> shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In the early years of the 21st century, additions to the waterpark doubled its size and led to a new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone.

Kennywood Entertainment, itself an operator of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies to purchase the group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the <a href="Six%20Flags">Six Flags</a> franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new owners would make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment announced that it would sell its parks to the <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>-based amusement company, <a href="Parques%20Reunidos">Parques Reunidos</a>. The fourth- and fifth-generation family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local.

In December 2009, Idlewild announced that the <a href="Royal%20Hanneford%20Circus">Royal Hanneford Circus</a> would perform at the park during the 2010 season, for the first time since 1997.

For the 2011 season, the park announced that they would replace their swimming pool—built in 1931—with a $2 million <a href="wave%20pool">wave pool</a>. The project will be the largest capital improvement undertaken by the park. The pool will be <a href="Swimming%20pool%23Zero-entry%20swimming%20pools">zero-entry</a> to a maximum deep and hold 280,600 gallons.

During interim time between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, it was announced that the park had permanently closed their popular attraction, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe. The attraction was re-themed, in coordination with <a href="The%20Fred%20Rogers%20Company">The Fred Rogers Company</a> to the much more relevant and popular spin-off of the classic children's program <a href="Mister%20Rogers%27%20Neighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Tiger%27s%20Neighborhood">Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a>. The re-themed attraction opened for 2015 season.

On August 11, 2016, a three-year-old boy was thrown from the Rollo Coaster. The boy sustained injuries and was rushed to a Pittsburgh hospital by helicopter, where he was listed in critical condition with head and chest injuries. The boy was in the hospital for two months before being released. The ride was closed pending an investigation and remained closed the remainder of the season, and all of the 2017 season. In May 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Division of Rides and Amusements released its investigative report, detailing how the riders switched seats after ride operators checked them, resulting in the riders not meeting the rider height requirements. In addition, the report noted several instances of excessive wear and movement of the train hitches and tracks, but that it wasn't known whether these factors caused the accident. The report listed several requirements for the ride to be reopened, including the addition of seat belts, a reevaluation of minimum rider height, and a ride evaluation by a Professional Engineer. Based on this report, the state also recommended amusement parks with similar roller coasters voluntarily make take the same actions. Idlewild announced they had procured a new train for the Rollo Coaster, which included seat belts, and that they expected the ride to resume operation for the 2018 season, pending a state inspection.

The park is situated alongside <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030">U.S. Route 30</a>, also historically known in Pennsylvania as the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>, the first US transcontinental highway. The region surrounding the park is the <a href="Laurel%20Highlands">Laurel Highlands</a>, and the park sits in the <a href="foothills">foothills</a> of the <a href="Laurel%20Hill%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Laurel Ridge</a>.

The region was prominent in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> with <a href="Fort%20Ligonier">Fort Ligonier</a> located just away. On November 12, 1758, volunteers led by <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> marched from Ligonier to aid <a href="George%20Mercer%20%28military%20officer%29">George Mercer</a> and his troops. At night in heavy fog, the two units mistook one another for the enemy and exchanged fire. Thirteen soldiers and one lieutenant were killed. Realizing the mistake, Washington ran amongst both groups, shouting and raising the men's rifles into the air. Washington later wrote of the incident that he never felt in more danger in his life. Though the location had never been entirely verified, in "Images of America: Idlewild", author Jeffrey S. Croushore acknowledges the opinion that the event took place in a section of Idlewild that was previously a wooded area known as the Woodlands.

Olde Idlewild is centered on the park's <a href="Philadelphia%20Toboggan%20Company">Philadelphia Toboggan Company</a> <a href="Carousel">Carousel</a>, (PTC #83) built in 1930 and brought to Idlewild in 1931. The Carousel's music is provided by two <a href="Fairground%20organ">band organs</a>: an Artizan Style D (fitted with a <a href="Wurlitzer">Wurlitzer</a> #103 roll frame as Wurlitzer rolls are more common than Artizan rolls) which is nicknamed "The Wurlitzan" and a Wurlitzer <a href="Calliope%20%28music%29">Caliola</a>. The music of these two organs, which are played on a regularly alternating basis, can be heard throughout Olde Idlewild and the lower parking areas. Olde Idlewild contains many of the park's traditional amusement rides. On the parking lot side of the Merry-Go-Round is the <a href="wooden%20roller%20coaster">wooden</a> <a href="Rollo%20Coaster">Rollo Coaster</a>, built by Philadelphia Toboggan in 1938 with lumber from the park, using a sawmill built nearby specifically for the project. The <a href="American%20Coaster%20Enthusiasts">American Coaster Enthusiasts</a> named the Rollo Coaster a "Classic Coaster". Sitting in the trees adjacent to the Loyalhanna Creek is the <a href="Wild%20Mouse%20%28Idlewild%29">Wild Mouse</a>, added in 1993. The Wild Mouse was built by <a href="Vekoma">Vekoma</a> and operated at <a href="Alton%20Towers">Alton Towers</a> in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, before being moved to Idlewild in 1993. The <a href="Twist%20%28ride%29">Scrambler</a>, the <a href="Flying%20Scooters">Flying Aces</a>, and the <a href="Tilt-A-Whirl">Tilt-A-Whirl</a> also surround the Merry-Go-Round.

Another group of rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's <a href="Bumper%20car">Skooters</a>, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the <a href="Balloon%20Race%20%28ride%29">Balloon Race</a>, <a href="Paratrooper%20%28ride%29">Paratrooper</a>, <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a>, and <a href="Octopus%20%28ride%29">Spider</a>. Below the Paratrooper on the north bank of the Loyalhanna are the <a href="The%20Whip%20%28ride%29">Whip</a>, built in 1938, and the <a href="Round%20Up%20%28ride%29">Super Round Up</a>. The Whip is closed indefinitely for repair.

Olde Idlewild contained a <a href="Caterpillar%20ride">Caterpillar</a> ride until 2013. Built in 1947, Idlewild's model was one of three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the only one that still utilized an undercarriage fan. The ride was removed to be refurbished and returned in the future.

In 1976, the Historic Village was built to commemorate the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. Modeled after a typical 19th century <a href="American%20Old%20West">Western town</a>, the area included a <a href="general%20store">general store</a>, <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> and wood shops, sheriff's office and jail, newspaper office, <a href="Western%20saloon">saloon</a> and restaurant.

In 1984, Historic Village was relocated from near the gates to the center of the park, and renamed Hootin' Holler. The area contains Confusion Hill, a themed walkthrough tour with optical illusions. The park's <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="Loyalhanna%20Limited%20Railroad">Loyalhanna Limited Railroad</a> attraction crosses the Loyalhanna Creek to Raccoon Lagoon and back. The area's newest rides are the Howler, a spinning ride modeled like a tornado, and Paul Bunyan's Loggin' Toboggan, a <a href="Log%20flume%20%28attraction%29">log flume</a> ride.

The location of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names it was called the H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year. The water park has since been expanded to include body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's <a href="Adventure%20Galley">Adventure Galley</a>, a play area added in 2006. The swimming pool was replaced by a heated <a href="wave%20pool">wave pool</a> in 2011. The addition was the park's single-largest capital improvement. For the 2013 season the park added a <a href="lazy%20river">lazy river</a> and an expanded beach area.

Added in 1983, Jumpin' Jungle is an interactive play area for both children and adults. The area includes many attractions such as a <a href="ball%20pit">ball pit</a>, <a href="playground%20slide">slides</a>, climbing nets, and a suspension bridge. Added in 2008, Bigfoot's Mudslide gets its name from <a href="Westmoreland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Westmoreland County's</a> reputation for the most sightings in Pennsylvania of <a href="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, an alleged ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests.

The park's kiddieland area, Raccoon Lagoon, was added in 1989, after originally opening in a different location in 1954. The area devoted to children-oriented rides is one of the largest in the United States. Also in Raccoon Lagoon was Mister Rogers' <a href="Neighborhood%20of%20Make-Believe">Neighborhood of Make-Believe</a>. Built in 1989, the <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> trolley ride was designed specifically for Idlewild by local native <a href="Fred%20Rogers">Fred Rogers</a> and is based on his <a href="Mister%20Rogers%27%20Neighborhood">popular children's television show</a>. Prior to the 2014 season, it was announced that the ride would be re-themed in coordination with Fred Rogers Productions to their modern children's show, "<a href="Daniel%20Tiger%27s%20Neighborhood">Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a>", based on the original series. The newly enhanced attraction, now named the Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Trolley Ride, re-opened in 2015.

Arthur Jennings, who portrayed the clown "Happy Dayze" in the park during the 1950s, was an accomplished engineer who approached park management about creating Story Book Forest, a theme park based on "emotion rather than motion". Jennings did much of the work himself, including life-sized models of <a href="fairy%20tales">fairy tales</a>. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a <a href="pirate%20ship">pirate ship</a>, a <a href="castle">castle</a>, and many live storybook characters. The entrance to the Forest is a giant storybook which reads "Here is the Land of Once Upon a Time ... Step through the pages of this big Story Book ... and visit the people and places every child knows ... and Loves. Here dreams are real ... and so are your Story Book friends." Now incorporated with the rest of the park, Story Book Forest celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006.

The Ligonier Highland Games is a <a href="highland%20games">highland games</a> event that takes place in early September. The events primarily take place at Idlewild, while some events also take place in nearby <a href="Greensburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Greensburg</a>. Competitions include heavy athletics such as the <a href="caber%20toss">caber toss</a>, <a href="stone%20put">stone put</a>, and <a href="weight%20throw">weight</a> and <a href="Scottish%20hammer%20throw">hammer throw</a>. Other competitions in <a href="Music%20of%20Scotland">music</a> include <a href="highland%20dancing">highland dancing</a>, solo and <a href="pipe%20band">band</a> <a href="bagpipes">piping</a>, drumming, <a href="Scottish%20fiddling">Scottish fiddling</a>, and <a href="Scottish%20harp">Scottish harp</a>. Vendors sell related items such as authentic <a href="tartans">tartans</a>, <a href="bagpipes">bagpipes</a>, and <a href="jewellery">jewellery</a>. While initially attracting crowds of 1,200, the festival now records average attendances near 10,000.

Idlewild and Soak Zone is the oldest operating amusement park in Pennsylvania, third oldest in the United States, and twelfth oldest in the world. The park has been recognized by <a href="trade%20magazine">trade magazine</a> "<a href="Amusement%20Today">Amusement Today</a>" with the "Golden Ticket" award for best children's park in the world every year since 2010. The park previously received Golden Tickets for the fifth-best children's area in 2006 and 2007 and second-best children's park for the sixth consecutive year in 2009. The <a href="National%20Amusement%20Park%20Historical%20Association">National Amusement Park Historical Association</a> recognized Idlewild as the best park for families in 2010, 2011, and 2012, having previously named it the fourth-best park in 2005, second in 2006, fourth again in 2007 and 2008, and third in 2009. The park was once named "America's Most Beautiful Theme Park".

Black mamba

The black mamba ("Dendroaspis polylepis") is a species of extremely <a href="venomous%20snake">venomous snake</a>, a member of the family <a href="Elapidae">Elapidae</a> native to parts of <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. First formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> in 1864, it is the second-longest venomous snake after the <a href="king%20cobra">king cobra</a>; mature specimens generally exceed and commonly grow to . Specimens of have been reported. Its skin colour varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age.

The species is both <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> (ground-living) and <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> (tree-living); it inhabits <a href="savannah">savannah</a>, <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> and is known to prey on birds and small mammals. Over suitable surfaces, it can move at speeds up to for short distances. Adult black mambas have few natural predators.

In a <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a>, the black mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s that often induce symptoms within ten minutes, and is frequently fatal unless <a href="antivenom">antivenom</a> is administered. Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, the black mamba only attacks humans if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN)'s <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List of Threatened Species</a>.

The first <a href="Species%20description">formal description</a> of the black mamba was made in 1864 by German-born British zoologist <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a>. A single specimen was one of many species of snake collected by <a href="John%20Kirk%20%28explorer%29">John Kirk</a>, a naturalist who accompanied <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a> on the 1858–1864 <a href="Second%20Zambesi%20expedition">Second Zambesi expedition</a>. This specimen is the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> and is housed in the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum, London</a>. The generic name of the species is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "dendron" ("δένδρον"), "tree", and "aspis" ("ἀσπίς") "<a href="Asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a>", and the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">specific epithet</a> "polylepis" is derived from the Ancient Greek "poly" ("πολύ") meaning "many" and "lepis" ("λεπίς") meaning "scale". The term "mamba" is derived from the <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a> word ""imamba"". In Tanzania, a local <a href="Ngindo%20language">Ngindo</a> name is "ndemalunyayo" ("grass-cutter") because it supposedly clips grass.

In 1873, German naturalist <a href="Wilhelm%20Peters">Wilhelm Peters</a> described "Dendraspis Antinorii" from a specimen in the museum of Genoa that had been collected by Italian explorer <a href="Orazio%20Antinori">Orazio Antinori</a> in what is now northern <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>. This was subsequently regarded as a subspecies and is no longer held to be distinct. In 1896, Belgian-British zoologist <a href="George%20Albert%20Boulenger">George Albert Boulenger</a> combined the species "Dendroaspis polylepis" as a whole with the <a href="eastern%20green%20mamba">eastern green mamba</a> ("Dendroaspis angusticeps"), a <a href="Lumpers%20and%20splitters">lumping</a> diagnosis that remained in force until 1946 when South African <a href="herpetologist">herpetologist</a> <a href="Vivian%20Frederick%20Maynard%20FitzSimons">Vivian FitzSimons</a> again split them into separate species. A 2016 genetic analysis showed the black and eastern green mambas are each others' closest relatives, and are more distantly related to <a href="Jameson%27s%20mamba">Jameson's mamba</a> ("Dendroaspis jamesoni").

The black mamba is a long, slender, cylindrical snake. It has a "coffin-shaped" head with a somewhat pronounced brow ridge and a medium-sized eye. The adult snake's length typically ranges from but specimens have grown to lengths of . It is the second-longest venomous snake species, exceeded in length only by the <a href="king%20cobra">king cobra</a>. The black mamba is a <a href="Snake_skeleton%23Proteroglyph">proteroglyphous</a> (front-fanged) snake, with <a href="fang">fang</a>s up to in length, located at the front of the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>. The tail of the species is long and thin, the <a href="Vertebra%23Other_animals">caudal vertebrae</a> making up 17–25% of its body length. Black mambas weigh about on average.

Specimens vary considerably in colour, including olive, yellowish-brown, khaki and <a href="Shades%20of%20gray%23Gunmetal">gunmetal</a> but are rarely black. The scales of some individuals may have a purplish glow. Individuals occasionally display dark mottling towards the posterior, which may appear in the form of diagonal crossbands. Black mambas have greyish-white underbellies and the inside of the mouth is dark bluish-grey to nearly black. Mamba eyes range between greyish-brown and shades of black; the pupil is surrounded by a silvery-white or yellow colour. Juvenile snakes are lighter in colour than adults; these are typically grey or olive green and darken as they age.

The number and pattern of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The arrangement of scales of the black mamba's head, body and tail are as follows:

The black mamba inhabits a wide range in <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>; it's range includes <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>, <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, and <a href="Angola">Angola</a>. The black mamba's distribution in parts of West Africa has been disputed. In 1954 the black mamba was recorded in the <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a> region of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. This observation, and a subsequent observation that identified a second specimen in the region in 1956, has not been confirmed and thus the snake's distribution in this area is inconclusive.

The species prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops and semi-arid savanna. It also inhabits moist savanna and lowland forests. It is not commonly found at altitudes above , although its distribution does include locations at in Kenya and in Zambia. It is rated as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN)'s <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a> of Endangered species, based on its huge range across sub-Saharan Africa and no documented decline.

The black mamba is both <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> and <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>. On the ground, it moves with its head and neck raised, and typically uses termite mounds, abandoned burrows, rock crevices and tree cracks as shelter. Black mambas are <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>; in South Africa, they are recorded to bask between 7 and 10 am and again from 2 to 4 pm. They may return daily to the same basking site.

Skittish and often unpredictable, the black mamba is agile and can move quickly. In the wild, black mambas seldom tolerate humans approaching more closely than about . When it perceives a threat, it retreats into brush or a hole. When confronted it is likely to engage in a threat display, gaping to expose its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to hiss and spread its neck-flap.

During the threat display, any sudden movement by the intruder may provoke the snake into performing a series of rapid strikes, leading to severe <a href="envenomation">envenomation</a>. The size of the black mamba and its ability to raise its head a large distance from the ground enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites to humans may occur on the upper body. The black mamba's reputation for being ready to attack is exaggerated; it is usually provoked by perceived threats such as the blocking of its movements and ability to retreat. The species' reputed speed has also been exaggerated; it cannot move more quickly than .

The black mamba's breeding season takes place between September and February, following the drop in temperature which occurs from April to June. Rival males compete by wrestling, attempting to subdue each other by intertwining their bodies and wrestling with their necks. Some observers have mistaken this for courtship. During mating, the male will slither over the dorsal side of the female while flicking its tongue. The female will signal its readiness to mate by lifting its tail and staying still. The male will then coil itself around the posterior end of the female and align its tail <a href="wikt%3Aventrolaterally">ventrolaterally</a> with the female's. Intercourse may last longer than two hours and the pair remain motionless apart from occasional spasms from the male.

The black mamba is <a href="Oviparity">oviparous</a>; the female lays a <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of 6–17 eggs. The eggs are elongated oval in shape, typically long and in diameter. When hatched, the young range from in length. They may grow quickly, reaching after their first year. Juvenile black mambas are very apprehensive and can be deadly like the adults. The black mamba is recorded to live up to 11 years and may live longer.

The black mamba usually hunts from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return if there is no disturbance. It mostly preys on birds, particularly nestlings and fledglings, and small mammals like rodents, bats, <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es and <a href="galago">bushbabies</a>. They generally prefer warm-blooded prey but will also consume other snakes. The black mamba does not typically hold onto its prey after biting; rather it releases its quarry and waits for it to succumb to paralysis and death before it swallows. The snake's potent digestive system has been recorded to fully digest prey in eight to ten hours.

Adult mambas have few natural predators aside from <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>. Young snakes have been recorded as prey of the <a href="Cape%20file%20snake">Cape file snake</a>. <a href="Mongooses">Mongooses</a>, which have some resistance to mamba venom and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes take a black mamba for prey. The similarly predatory <a href="honey%20badger">honey badger</a> is also resistant. The mechanism in both mammals is thought to be that their muscular <a href="nicotinic%20acetylcholine%20receptor">nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a>s do not bind snake alpha-neurotoxins.

The black mamba is the most feared snake in Africa because of its size, aggression, toxicity and speed of onset of symptoms, and is classified as a snake of medical importance by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>. A survey in South Africa from 1957 to 1979 recorded 2553 venomous snakebites, 75 of which were confirmed as being from black mambas. Of these 75 cases, 63 had symptoms of systemic envenomation and 21 died. Those bitten before 1962 received a <a href="Snake_antivenom%23Monovalent_vs._polyvalent">polyvalent</a> venom that had no effect on black mamba venom, and 15 people out of 35 who received the antivenom died. A mamba-specific antivenom was introduced in 1962, followed by a fully polyvalent antivenom in 1971. Over this period, 5 people out of 38 bitten by black mambas and given antivenom died. A census in rural Zimbabwe in 1991 and 1992 revealed 274 cases of snakebite, of which 5 died. Black mambas were confirmed in 15 cases, of which 2 died. The peak period for deaths is the species' breeding season from September to February, during which black mambas are most irritable. Bites are very rare outside Africa; snake handlers and enthusiasts are the usual victims.

Unlike many venomous snake species, black mamba venom does not contain <a href="protease">protease</a> enzymes. Its bites do not generally cause local swelling or <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, and a tingling sensation in the bitten area might be the only initial symptom. The snake tends to bite repeatedly and let go, so there might be multiple puncture wounds. Its bite can deliver about 100–120 mg of venom on average; the maximum recorded dose is 400 mg. The <a href="mice">murine</a> <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) when administered <a href="intravenous%20injection">intravenously</a> has been calculated at 0.32 and 0.33 mg/kg. Bites were often fatal before antivenom was widely available.

The venom is predominantly <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxic</a>; symptoms often become apparent within ten minutes. Early neurological signs that indicate severe envenoming include metallic taste, drooping eyelids (<a href="ptosis%20%28eyelid%29">ptosis</a>) and gradual symptoms of <a href="bulbar%20palsy">bulbar palsy</a>. Other neurological symptoms include <a href="miosis">miosis</a>, blurred or diminished vision, <a href="paresthesia">paresthesia</a>, <a href="dysarthria">dysarthria</a>, <a href="dysphagia">dysphagia</a>, <a href="dyspnea">dyspnea</a>, difficulty handling oral secretions, an absent <a href="Pharyngeal%20reflex">gag reflex</a>, <a href="fasciculation">fasciculation</a>s, <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>, <a href="vertigo">vertigo</a>, drowsiness and loss of consciousness, and respiratory paralysis. Other more general symptoms include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, sweating, salivation, goosebumps and red eyes. The bite of a black mamba can cause <a href="Collapse%20%28medical%29">collapse</a> in humans within 45 minutes or less. Without appropriate antivenom treatment, symptoms typically progress to <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>, which leads to <a href="cardiovascular%20collapse">cardiovascular collapse</a> and death. This typically occurs in 7 to 15 hours.

In 2015, the <a href="proteome">proteome</a> (complete protein profile) of black mamba venom was assessed and published, revealing 41 distinct proteins and one <a href="nucleoside">nucleoside</a>. The venom is composed of two main families of toxic agents, <a href="dendrotoxin">dendrotoxin</a>s (I and K) and (at a slightly lower proportion) <a href="three-finger%20toxin">three-finger toxin</a>s. Dendrotoxins are akin to <a href="kunitz%20domain">kunitz</a>-type protease inhibitors that interact with voltage-dependent potassium channels, stimulating acetylcholine and causing an excitatory effect, and are thought to cause symptoms such as sweating. Member of the three-finger family include <a href="alpha-neurotoxin">alpha-neurotoxin</a>, <a href="cardiotoxin">cardiotoxin</a>s, <a href="fasciculin">fasciculin</a>s and mambalgins. The most toxic components are the alpha-neurotoxins, which bind nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and hence block the action of <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> at the <a href="postsynaptic%20membrane">postsynaptic membrane</a> and cause <a href="neuromuscular%20blockade">neuromuscular blockade</a> and hence paralysis. Fasciculins are <a href="anticholinesterase">anticholinesterase</a> inhibitors that cause <a href="muscle%20fasciculation">muscle fasciculation</a>. The venom has little or no haemolytic, haemorrhagic or procoagulant activity. <a href="Mambalgins">Mambalgins</a> act as inhibitors for <a href="acid-sensing%20ion%20channel">acid-sensing ion channel</a>s in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inhibiting effect. There is research interest in their analgesic potential. 

The composition of black mamba venom differs markedly from those of other mambas, all of which contain predominantly three-finger toxin agents. It is thought this may reflect the preferred prey items—small mammals for the mainly land-dwelling black mamba versus birds for the predominantly arboreal other mambas. Unlike many snake species, black mamba venom has little <a href="phospholipase%20A2">phospholipase A2</a> content.

Standard first aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is the application of a pressure bandage to the bite site, minimisation of movement of the victim and conveyance to a hospital or clinic as quickly as possible. The lethal, neurotoxic nature of black mamba venom means an arterial <a href="tourniquet">tourniquet</a> may be of benefit. <a href="Tetanus%20vaccine">Tetanus toxoid</a> is given, though the main treatment is the administration of the appropriate antivenom. A polyvalent antivenom produced by the <a href="South%20African%20Institute%20for%20Medical%20Research">South African Institute for Medical Research</a> is used to treat black mamba bites, and a new antivenom is being developed by the <a href="Universidad%20de%20Costa%20Rica">Universidad de Costa Rica</a>'s <a href="Instituto%20Clodomiro%20Picado">Instituto Clodomiro Picado</a>.

Danie Pienaar, who was at various times from at least 2009 to 2017 head of <a href="South%20African%20National%20Parks">South African National Parks</a> Scientific Services and acting managing executive, survived the bite of a black mamba without antivenom in 1998. Despite the hospital physicians having declared it a "moderate" envenomation, Pienaar lapsed into a coma at one point and his prognosis was declared "poor". Upon arrival at hospital Pienaar was immediately <a href="intubated">intubated</a> and placed on <a href="life%20support">life support</a> for three days. He was released from hospital on the fifth day. Remaining calm after being bitten increased his chances of survival, as did the application of a tourniquet.

In March 2008, 28-year-old <a href="British%20people">British</a> trainee safari guide Nathan Layton was bitten by a black mamba that had been found near his classroom at the Southern African Wildlife College in <a href="Hoedspruit">Hoedspruit</a>. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, and first aid-trained staff who examined him determined he could carry on with lectures. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Layton complained of blurred vision within an hour of being bitten, and collapsed and died shortly thereafter.

American professional photographer Mark Laita was bitten on the leg by a black mamba during a photo-shoot of a black mamba at a facility in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. Bleeding profusely, he did not seek medical attention, and except for intense pain and local swelling overnight, he was not affected. This led him to believe that either the snake gave him a "<a href="dry%20bite">dry bite</a>" (a bite without injecting venom) or the heavy bleeding pushed the venom out. Some commenters on the story suggested that it was a <a href="venomoid">venomoid</a> snake (in which the venom glands are surgically removed), but Laita responded that it was not. Only later did Laita find that he had captured the snake biting his leg in a photograph.

In 2016, Kenyan woman Cheposait Adomo was attacked by three black mambas, one of which bit her repeatedly on the leg, in <a href="West%20Pokot%20County">West Pokot County</a>, Kenya. People coming to her aid drove off the other snakes, hacking two with a machete. After an attempt using traditional medicine, they placed her on a motorcycle and conveyed her 45 minutes to the nearest hospital, which had antivenom. She survived. Health services in Africa are trying to educate people about snakebite, as use of traditional medicine can delay vital treatment.

Benty Grange helmet

The Benty Grange helmet is a boar-crested <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> helmet from the 7th century AD. It was excavated by <a href="Thomas%20Bateman">Thomas Bateman</a> in 1848 from a <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> at the <a href="Benty%20Grange">Benty Grange</a> farm in <a href="Monyash">Monyash</a> in western <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. The grave had likely been looted by the time of Bateman's excavation, but still contained other high-status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial, such as the <a href="Benty%20Grange%20hanging%20bowl">fragmentary remains of a hanging bowl</a>. The helmet is displayed at <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>'s <a href="Weston%20Park%20Museum">Weston Park Museum</a>, which purchased it from Bateman's estate in 1893.

The helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather; the organic material has since decayed. It would have provided some protection against weapons, but was also ornate and may have been intended for ceremonial use. It was the first Anglo-Saxon helmet to be discovered; five others, from <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">York</a>, <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>, <a href="Shorwell%20helmet">Shorwell</a>, and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>, have been found since. The helmet features a unique combination of structural and technical attributes, but contemporaneous parallels exist for its individual characteristics. It is classified as one of the "crested helmets" used in Northern Europe from the 6th to 11th centuries AD.

The most striking feature of the helmet is the boar at its apex; this pagan symbol faces towards a <a href="Christian%20cross">Christian cross</a> on the <a href="nasal%20helmet">nasal</a> in a display of <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a>. This is representative of 7th-century England when Christian missionaries were slowly converting Anglo-Saxons away from traditional <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic mythology</a>. The helmet seems to exhibit a stronger preference towards paganism, with a large boar and a small cross. The cross may have been added for talismanic effect, the help of any god being welcome on the battlefield. The boar atop the crest was likewise associated with protection and suggests a time when boar-crested helmets may have been common, as do the helmet from Wollaston and the <a href="Guilden%20Morden%20boar">Guilden Morden boar</a>. The contemporary epic "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>" mentions such helmets five times and speaks of the strength of men "when the hefted sword, its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood, razes the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet".

The Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn. It probably weighed about , the weight of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 replica. The framework, which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments, originally consisted of seven iron strips, each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick. A brow band, long and wide, encircled the head. Two strips of the same width ran from front to back, and from side to side. The long nose-to-<a href="nape">nape</a> band extended in the front and in the back; the extension over the nose was straight, whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards, so as to fit the nape of the wearer. The lateral band ran from ear to ear; both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band, but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection. It was affixed to the outside of the <a href="Dexter%20and%20sinister">dexter</a> (wearer's right) side of the brow band, the inside of the <a href="Dexter%20and%20sinister">sinister</a> (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-nape band. The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron, only one of which now survives. Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band from the centre of the lateral band. Here they were wide, and, while tapering towards a width of , rose at a 70° angle towards the lateral band, which they overlapped at a 50° angle just beneath the crest. The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth, since decayed.

Eight plates of horn, probably softened and bent and suggested to be from <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame. No horn now survives, but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern. The plates were fitted over the iron, thereby hiding it, and abutted at the centre of each strip. The joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top. The three layers—iron at the bottom, followed by two layers of horn—were held together by a succession of <a href="rivet">rivet</a>s: iron rivets placed from inside the helmet, and rivets made of, or coated in, silver, with ornamental heads in the shape of a double-headed axe, placed from the outside, apart. Traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose-to-nape band, and on the rear brow band, suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard. These suggest that pieces of horn, extending from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose-to-nape band, would have met each extension of the lateral band at a 5° angle, reaching them from the centre of the brow band.

In addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet, two features provide added decoration: a cross on the <a href="nasal%20helmet">nasal</a> and a boar on the crest. The silver cross is long by wide, and consists of two parts. A silver strip was added underneath, elongating what was originally an equal-armed cross. It was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets, one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom. Around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty-nine silver studs, out of a suggested original forty, that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn.

The most distinctive feature of the Benty Grange helmet is its boar, affixed to the apex of the helmet. The core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow D-sectioned bronze tubes, their flat sides approximately apart. The space between the two halves was filled in with a substance, likely horn or metal, which has now disintegrated; it perhaps projected upwards, forming the mane or spine of the boar, or, as has been interpreted on the replica, created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit. On either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron, forming the visible exterior of the boar. Four <a href="pear">pear</a>-shaped plates of <a href="Gilding">gilded</a> silver—cut down and filed from Roman silver, as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate, and file marks on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>—acted as hips, through which passed two silver rivets, one atop the other, per end. These rivets held together the five layers of the boar, and were welded to the plates. Into the body of the boar were placed holes, probably punched, that held circular silver studs approximately in diameter. The studs, likely flush with the surface of the body, were filed down and gilded, and may have been intended to represent golden bristles. Eyes were formed with long pointed oval <a href="garnet">garnet</a>s set into gold sockets with <a href="filigree">filigree</a> wire edging. The sockets were long by wide, and had long shanks, filled with <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>, sunk into the head. Individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail, tusks, muzzle, jawline, and ears of the boar, but few traces of them now remain. Two sets of iron legs—probably solid originally, but rendered hollow by corrosion—attached the body to an elliptical bronze plate; both sets depict front legs, bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar's fore and hind limbs. The elliptical plate is long with a maximum width of , and matches the curvature of the helmet. Four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet, in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre. The plate was probably affixed directly to the frame, the legs passing through holes in the horn.

The Benty Grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle, and indicated its wearer's status. As the Weston Park replica shows, it would have originally been an impressive object, and may have been intended for ceremonial use. Experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an <a href="axe">axe</a>, which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it. Arrows and spears pierced the horn, but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets.

Helmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and the Benty Grange helmet, both by its richness and its scarcity, signified the high status of its owner. Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent. In the contemporary epic "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", a poem about kings and nobles, they are relatively common, while the helmeted <a href="Vendel">Vendel</a> and <a href="Valsg%C3%A4rde">Valsgärde</a> graves from the same period in Sweden, thought to be the burials of wealthy non-royals, suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the absolute élite. Yet thousands of furnished Anglo-Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare; this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition, but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers.

The helmet was discovered on 3 May 1848 during an excavation on the <a href="Benty%20Grange">Benty Grange</a> farm in Derbyshire, in what is now the <a href="Peak%20District">Peak District</a> National Park. It was found by <a href="Thomas%20Bateman">Thomas Bateman</a>, an archaeologist and antiquarian who was nicknamed "The Barrow Knight" for his excavation of more than 500 <a href="tumulus">barrows</a>. Bateman described Benty Grange as "a high and bleak situation"; its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road, now the <a href="A515%20road">A515</a>, possibly to display the burial to passing travellers. It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments, <a href="Arbor%20Low">Arbor Low</a> <a href="Stone%20circles">stone circle</a> and <a href="Gib%20Hill">Gib Hill</a> barrow. According to the 7th- to 9th-century <a href="Tribal%20Hidage">Tribal Hidage</a>, the region was governed by the <a href="Pecsaetan">Pecsæte</a>, and so the Benty Grange barrow may memorialise a member of this Anglo-Saxon tribe, or one of its ancestors. The barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately in diameter and high, an encircling fosse about wide and deep, and outer penannular banks around wide and high. The entire structure measures approximately .

Unnoted in Bateman's account is that he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave. The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by , and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted. Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials, only one of which was discovered by Bateman.

Bateman suggested a body once lay at the centre of the barrow, flat against the original surface of the soil, of which little remained; what he described as the one remnant, strands of hair, is now thought to be from a cloak of fur, cowhide or something similar. The recovered objects were found in two clusters. One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair, the other about to the west. In the former area Bateman described "a curious assemblage of ornaments", which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth. This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood, approximately in diameter at the mouth. Its rim was edged with silver, while its surface was "decorated by four wheel-shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver, affixed by pins of the same metal, clenched inside". Also found were <a href="Benty%20Grange%20hanging%20bowl">the remnants</a> of three <a href="hanging%20bowl">hanging bowl</a> escutcheons, as well as "a knot of very fine wire", and some "thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges &c." attached to silk, but that soon decayed when exposed to air.

Approximately to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork. Separated, this mass included a collection of chainwork, a six-pronged piece of iron resembling a <a href="Pitchfork">hayfork</a>, and the helmet. As Bateman described it,

Bateman closed his 1849 account of the excavation by noting the "particularly corrosive nature of the soil", which by 1861 he said "has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire". He suggested that this was the result of "a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid; the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth, and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains." Bateman's friend <a href="Llewellynn%20Jewitt">Llewellynn Jewitt</a>, an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations, painted four watercolours of the finds, parts of which were included in Bateman's 1849 account. This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations, a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow.

The helmet entered the extensive collection of Bateman, where it attracted interest, and in 1855 was catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow. In 1861 Bateman died at 39, and in 1876 his son, Thomas W. Bateman, loaned the objects to Sheffield. They were displayed at the <a href="Weston%20Park%20Museum">Weston Park Museum</a> through 1893, at which time the museum purchased objects, including the helmet, from the family; other pieces were dispersed elsewhere. As of 2018, the helmet remains in the collection of the museum. It has also been featured in exhibitions, such as when from 8 November 1991 to 8 March 1992 it joined the <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">Coppergate helmet</a> at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> for "The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, AD 600–900".

The Benty Grange barrow was designated a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> on 23 October 1970. The list entry notes that "[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains." It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information. The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014; as of 2018 it is rented out as a holiday cottage.

In 1948, the helmet was brought to the British Museum to undergo cleaning and study. Permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year, when <a href="Rupert%20Bruce-Mitford">Rupert Bruce-Mitford</a>, recently returned from <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> service in the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Signals</a> to an assistant keepership at the museum, spent time in Sheffield examining the Benty Grange <a href="grave%20goods">grave goods</a>. A 1940 letter from <a href="T.%20D.%20Kendrick">T. D. Kendrick</a> to Bruce-Mitford's army camp had assigned him his position, and responsibility for the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> discoveries—"Brace yourself for the task", the letter concluded. Upon his return, he therefore took to studying the comparison material; his work in 1947 included the excavation of the Valsgärde 11 boat-grave in Sweden alongside <a href="Sune%20Lindqvist">Sune Lindqvist</a>, and the trip to Sheffield, intended to shed light on the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo helmet</a> through comparison with the only other Anglo-Saxon helmet then known. Permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the Weston Park Museum for the proposed work, and, in April 1948, a century and a month after its discovery, the Benty Grange helmet was brought to London.

Work at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory <a href="Harold%20Plenderleith">Harold Plenderleith</a>, who in some cases, particularly with the boar, did the work himself; additional input was provided by Bruce-Mitford, the technical attaché and authority on ancient metalwork <a href="Herbert%20Maryon">Herbert Maryon</a>, and the archaeologist and art historian <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20Henry">Françoise Henry</a>. In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode, and certain parts had become indiscernible. The boar was unrecognizable, and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured. A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation, revealing the underlying features. During this process, the boar, hitherto thought solid, snapped in two. Bruce-Mitford termed this occurrence "fortunate", for it revealed the boar's inner structure. The remnants of horn were also examined at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> by keeper of zoology <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Fraser">Frederic Charles Fraser</a>, and experiments softening and shaping modern horn conducted.

The Benty Grange helmet is dated to the first half of the 7th century AD, on the basis of its technical construction and decorative style. It is one of six <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> helmets, joined by the subsequent discoveries from <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">York</a>, <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>, <a href="Shorwell%20helmet">Shorwell</a>, and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>. These are all, other than the Frankish Shorwell helmet, examples of the "crested helmets" known in <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a> in the 6th through 11th centuries AD. Such helmets are characterized by prominent crests and rounded caps, traits shared by the Benty Grange example, and other than a <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> fragment found in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, uniformly originate from England or Scandinavia; contemporary continental helmets were primarily <a href="spangenhelm">spangenhelm</a> or <a href="lamellenhelm">lamellenhelm</a>.

The ultimate form of the helmet is unparalleled among surviving Anglo-Saxon and crested helmets, although individual characteristics are shared. While other Anglo-Saxon helmets were typically formed with wide perpendicular bands and four infill plates, their Swedish counterparts from Vendel and Valsgärde display similar use of thin iron frameworks. The complicated construction of the Benty Grange boar, which combines garnet, filigree, gold, silver, iron, and bronze, is unique across ornamental Anglo-Saxon objects, but the general boar-crest is paralleled by the Wollaston and <a href="Guilden%20Morden%20boar">Guilden Morden</a> boars. One other helmet exhibits the use of horn, but it is the spangenhelm-type helmet of a high-status child, discovered in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>.

The helmet was made during the nascent days of <a href="History%20of%20Christianity%20in%20Britain%23England">Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England</a>, and exhibits both <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> and <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">pagan</a> motifs. The boar invokes a pagan tradition at the time a thousand years old, the cross a Christian belief around for half that time. <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman rule of Britain</a> had brought with it the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, and the Roman departure in 410 AD had brought about its decline; thereafter Christianity in Britain diverged into <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">distinct and unrecognisable forms</a>, or met the influx of Anglo-Saxons from continental Europe and was replaced with Germanic traditions that had been repressed for the last 400 years. The lowland areas of Britain, including the Peak District where the Benty Grange helmet was found, were particularly susceptible to the Anglo-Saxon invasion and attendant loss of local culture and religion. To the extent that Christianity survived in <a href="sub-Roman%20Britain">sub-Roman Britain</a>, it was in the more isolated highland areas: <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>.

Christianity rearrived in England in 597 on the backs of the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a>aries, and took hold once <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">King Æthelberht</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> gave them purchase to stay and preach. Æthelberht himself converted before his death in 616, and within the course of a century so did most nobles and their retainers; several more, and the lower classes had followed suit. Yet the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England was not a linear progression of Christian successes. King <a href="R%C3%A6dwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Rædwald</a> of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, for whom the Sutton Hoo <a href="ship%20burial">ship-burial</a> may have been built, was converted while visiting Æthelberht, and then reconverted upon returning home; henceforth he kept both pagan and Christian altars, in a show of religious <a href="Dualistic%20cosmology">dualism</a>. By the time the hundred years of aristocratic conversion was over, almost every court had required at least two conversions.

The Benty Grange helmet was made during this time of change, as evidenced by its <a href="Syncretism">syncretic</a> display. It emphasises the pagan element, a large boar dominating a small cross. The cross may not necessarily be an indication of Christian belief; it may have instead been chosen for its <a href="Apotropaic%20magic">amuletic</a> effect. Whatever the politics behind religious conversion, the battlefield was not a place to discriminate against gods.

The <a href="Wild%20boar">boar</a> had symbolic import in prehistoric Europe, where it was "venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time." Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne">La Tène</a> examples in the 4th century BC, <a href="Gauls">Gaulish</a> specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the 4th century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a <a href="mother%20goddess">mother goddess</a> figure among linguistically Celtic communities in <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> Europe, while the Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, writing around the 1st century AD, suggested that the <a href="Balts">Baltic</a> <a href="Aesti">Aesti</a> wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection.

Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium <a href="Gundestrup%20cauldron">Gundestrup cauldron</a>, discovered in Denmark, and on a <a href="Torslunda%20plates">Torslunda plate</a> from Sweden, made 500 years later. The Romans also included the boar as one of their many symbols—four <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a>, including the <a href="Legio%20XX%20Valeria%20Victrix">twentieth</a>, adopted it as their emblem. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic tradition</a> during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a> and <a href="Freyr">Freyr</a>. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and <a href="Horncastle%20helmet%20fragment">Horncastle</a>, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the "Beowulf" poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

The Benty Grange helmet recalls the Anglo-Saxon poem "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", in which boar-adorned helmets are mentioned five times. Three passages appear to describe examples that, like the Benty Grange helmet, are topped with a freestanding boar. After <a href="%C3%86schere">Æschere</a> is killed by <a href="Grendel%27s%20mother">Grendel's mother</a>, King <a href="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a>'s lamentation speaks of such helmets.

The devastation wrought by Grendel's mother itself invokes a boar-crested helmet, for "[h]er onslaught was less only by as much as an amazon warrior's strength is less than an armed man's when the hefted sword, its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood, razed the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet" (). These two passages likely refer to boar-crests like those found on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, and the detached Guilden Morden boar.

Drosera regia, commonly known as the king sundew, is a <a href="carnivorous%20plant">carnivorous plant</a> in the sundew genus "<a href="Drosera">Drosera</a>" that is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to a single valley in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. The genus name "Drosera" comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "droseros", meaning "dew-covered". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "regia" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "royal", a reference to the "striking appearance" of the species. Individual leaves can reach in length. It has many unusual <a href="relict">relict</a> characteristics not found in most other "Drosera" species, including woody <a href="rhizome">rhizome</a>s, <a href="operculum%20%28botany%29">operculate</a> <a href="pollen">pollen</a>, and the lack of <a href="circinate%20vernation">circinate vernation</a> in <a href="scape%20%28botany%29">scape</a> growth. All of these factors, combined with <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular data</a> from <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis, contribute to the evidence that "D. regia" possesses some of the most ancient characteristics within the genus. Some of these are shared with the related <a href="Venus%20flytrap">Venus flytrap</a> ("Dionaea muscipula"), which suggests a close evolutionary relationship.

The <a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>-covered leaves can capture large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all "Drosera" species have specialised stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky <a href="mucilage">mucilage</a>. The leaves are considered active <a href="carnivorous%20plant%23Flypaper%20traps">flypaper traps</a> that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it. In its native <a href="fynbos">fynbos</a> habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s. Of the two known populations of "D. regia", the higher altitude site appears to be overgrown and is essentially <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a>. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered "Drosera" species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and a single <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> has been registered.

"Drosera regia" plants are fairly large <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herb</a>s that produce horizontal woody <a href="rhizome">rhizome</a>s and a crown of large, linear leaves up to long and wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (<a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>s) on the upper surface of the <a href="leaf">lamina</a> along nearly the entire length of the leaf. The leaves lack <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a> and <a href="stipule">stipule</a>s, emerging by <a href="circinate%20vernation">circinate vernation</a> (uncurling) and tapering to a <a href="leaf%20shape">filiform</a> point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky <a href="mucilage">mucilage</a> produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, "D. regia" has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go <a href="dormancy">dormant</a> during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.

The woody rhizomes produced by the plant are one of the unusual characteristics that it shares only with "<a href="Drosera%20arcturi">D. arcturi</a>" in the genus; the absence of woody rhizomes in all other "Drosera" is often cited as an indication of the presumed ancient lineage of "D. regia" and "D. arcturi". "Drosera regia" also produces relatively few thick, fleshy roots, which possess <a href="root%20hair">root hair</a>s along the terminal . Asexual reproduction of mature plants usually occurs after <a href="flowering">flowering</a> with new plants arising from the rhizome and roots. After a fire, undamaged roots will often re-sprout new plants.

"Drosera regia" flowers in January and February, producing <a href="scape%20%28botany%29">scapes</a> up to long. The scapes emerge vertically, lacking the circinate vernation of its leaves and all other scapes of the genus "Drosera", with the exception of "D. arcturi". The scapes consist of two primary branches and bear 5 to 20 (sometimes 30) unscented pink flowers with long petals. <a href="Bract">Bract</a>s are small, bearing some reduced tentacles. Each flower has three unbranched, spreading <a href="style%20%28botany%29">styles</a> emerging from the top of the <a href="ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a> and extending beyond the five erect <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s (15 mm long), which surround the ovary. This arrangement minimizes the chance of <a href="self-fertilisation">self-fertilisation</a>. Studies have shown that the <a href="operculum%20%28botany%29">operculate</a> <a href="pollen">pollen</a> shed in tetrads (fused groups of four pollen grains), characteristics that are similar in the related "<a href="Dionaea%20muscipula">Dionaea muscipula</a>" (the Venus flytrap) and "<a href="Aldrovanda%20vesiculosa">Aldrovanda vesiculosa</a>", is incompatible with <a href="clone%20%28plant%29">clones</a>, failing to produce seed when plants are self-fertilised. Seeds are brown to black, linear and ornamented with fine network-like markings, and 2 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter. Seed is shed by the end of March.

The unusual characteristics that set it apart from other species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. "Drosera regia" shares other features with the robust <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>n form of "D. arcturi", including the lack of stipules and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the scape.

It has a <a href="diploid">diploid</a> <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> number of 2"n" = 34, which is unusual for the genus "Drosera" and closer to the diploid chromosome number of the Venus flytrap ("Dionaea muscipula"), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for "Dionaea" from multiple studies include 2"n" = 30, 32, and 33. Of the "Drosera" species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of "x" = 10. Based on an extensive review of <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> studies, the botanist <a href="Fernando%20Rivadavia">Fernando Rivadavia</a> suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2"n" = 20, a number that many "Drosera" species share including the widespread "<a href="Drosera%20rotundifolia">D. rotundifolia</a>". Exceptions to this base number include the <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n "Drosera", which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2"n" = 6 to 64.

"Drosera regia" is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to South Africa and has only ever been found at two sites at altitudes of in the Bainskloof Range near <a href="Wellington%2C%20Western%20Cape">Wellington, Western Cape</a> in South Africa. Despite extensive exploration, "D. regia" has not been found at any similar location in neighbouring valleys. Small <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> variations such as broader leaves have been recorded from these two small populations, which are restricted to an area of just a few hundred square meters. "Drosera regia" is found in a natural <a href="fynbos">fynbos</a> vegetation amongst dense marshy grasses. The fynbos habitat is similar to a low or medium <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a> or <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heathland</a>, dominated by low <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a> shrubs.

The lower altitude site where "D. regia" is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a <a href="gravel">gravel</a> <a href="bench%20%28geology%29">bench</a> formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a <a href="peat">peat</a>y <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> sand, often with a gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated <a href="grass">grass</a>es and <a href="Cyperaceae">sedge</a>s when gravel is absent and below ground when there is a gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of "<a href="Leucadendron">Leucadendron</a>" and members of the families <a href="Cyperaceae">Cyperaceae</a>, <a href="Iridaceae">Iridaceae</a>, and <a href="Restionaceae">Restionaceae</a>. The habitat of "D. regia" depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out "D. regia". Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.

In a 2009 report of a 2006 trip, botanist Andreas Fleischmann noted that the higher altitude site is overgrown with plants of the family <a href="Restionaceae">Restionaceae</a> and he could not locate any remaining "D. regia". The lower altitude site was in a similar state, but he recorded approximately 50 mature plants, making this one of the most critically endangered "Drosera" species. While "D. regia" has not been evaluated under the current <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature%20and%20Natural%20Resources">International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a> (IUCN) standards for a rating on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List of Threatened Species</a>, the <a href="International%20Carnivorous%20Plant%20Society">International Carnivorous Plant Society</a> recognised "D. regia" on their list of imperiled carnivorous plant species. "Drosera regia" was also listed as "rare" on an early IUCN report in 1997, but these earlier IUCN assessments were often poorly documented and are thus not relied upon today. Several other authors have identified how rare "D. regia" is in the wild, even calling it "threatened with extinction".

The short-term prognosis for natural populations of "D. regia" was greatly improved when a fire swept through its habitat in 2015. A team from <a href="Stellenbosch">Stellenbosch</a> <a href="Stellenbosch%20Botanical%20Gardens">Botanical Gardens</a> found new populations in the lower elevation zone and rediscovered plants in the higher elevation zone.

"Drosera regia" was originally described by South African botanist <a href="Edith%20Layard%20Stephens">Edith Layard Stephens</a> in 1926. The <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> "Drosera regia" is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "droseros", meaning "dew-covered" and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "regia" comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "royal", a reference to what Stephens described as its "striking appearance". The genus is collectively referred to as the sundews, while "Drosera regia" is commonly referred to as the king sundew. Stephens was informed about this new species by Mr. J. Rennie, who had found several plants growing by a stream in the upper end of "Baviaans Kloof" on <a href="Easter">Easter</a> in 1923. Additional specimens were located directly above this site on a <a href="plateau">plateau</a> between South Ridge Peak and Observation Point. A second population was located in 1926 about away below the Slanghoek Peak near the headwaters of the Witte River.

Stephens placed "D. regia" in <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Psychophila" <a href="Planch.">Planch.</a>, which at that time included "<a href="Drosera%20arcturi">D. arcturi</a>", "<a href="Drosera%20stenopetala">D. stenopetala</a>", and "<a href="Drosera%20uniflora">D. uniflora</a>", though she noted that the many-flowered inflorescence was unusual for this group. In 1970, the South African botanist <a href="Anna%20Amelia%20Obermeyer">Anna Amelia Obermeyer</a> suggested that "D. regia" did not fit into any of the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> groups established by <a href="Ludwig%20Diels">Ludwig Diels</a> in his 1906 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on the family. Obermeyer noted the unusual characteristics that set "D. regia" apart from any other "Drosera" species: the operculate pollen, circinate leaf vernation, undivided styles, and woody rhizomes. In 1994, Rüdiger Seine and <a href="Wilhelm%20Barthlott">Wilhelm Barthlott</a> proposed classifying "D. regia" as the sole species in a new <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a>, "Drosera" subg. "Regiae", to "give adequate recognition to the isolated position of "D. regia" within the genus." This taxonomic position was affirmed by Jan Schlauer in his <a href="dichotomous%20key">dichotomous key</a> and taxonomic revisions published in 1996. Also in 1996 two <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> researchers, Jindřich Chrtek and Zdeňka Slavíková, proposed changes to the taxonomy of the genus by splitting "D. regia" off into its own, <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus, "Freatulina". Chrtek and Slavíková cited the many morphological differences between "D. regia" and every other member of the genus "Drosera" in support of their decision to make this taxonomic split. They reaffirmed their taxonomic opinions in a 1999 article that also split the <a href="tuber">tuber</a>ous "Drosera", members of the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Drosera%20subg.%20Ergaleium">Ergaleium</a>", to <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Christian%20Lehmann">Johann Georg Christian Lehmann</a>'s resurrected genus "Sondera". These taxonomic revisions, however, have not gained any support, being rejected or largely ignored by recent publications on the genus.

<a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of morphological characteristics and gene sequences has supported the <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> position within the genus long suspected of "D. regia", often regarded as the most ancient of all <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> "Drosera" species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all "Drosera" such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis based on <a href="RuBisCO">"rbcL"</a> and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that "D. regia" formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> sister to all other "Drosera" surveyed, with "Dionaea muscipula" forming a sister clade to all "Drosera". Further analysis in 2002 based on the <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> <a href="18S%20ribosomal%20RNA">18S rDNA</a>, <a href="plastid">plastid</a> DNA ("rbcL", "matK", "atpB"), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of "D. regia" in the genus and its close relationship with "Dionaea" and "<a href="Aldrovanda">Aldrovanda</a>". New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between "D. regia" and "D. arcturi", both of which clustered basally with respect to all other "Drosera", suggesting a link between "D. regia" and all other "Drosera" through its relationship with "D. arcturi".

Evidence for the evolution of "snap-traps" of "Dionaea" and "Aldrovanda" from a flypaper trap like "D. regia" has also emerged and been argued for based on <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular data</a>. The molecular and physiological data implies that the Venus flytrap ("Dionaea") and "Aldrovanda" snap-traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with the "Drosera"; the living evidence of a link between "Drosera" and "Dionaea" is "D. regia" and its remnant characteristics. In this evolutionary model, pre-adaptations to evolution into snap-traps were identified in several species of "Drosera", such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap-trap evolved from the flypaper traps of "Drosera", driven by increasing prey size. Larger prey can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; the evolution of snap-traps would largely prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive any benefit from it).

"Drosera regia" cultivation was first attempted prior to the formal description of the species in 1926. The author, <a href="Edith%20Layard%20Stephens">Edith Layard Stephens</a>, reported the successful cultivation of "D. regia", noting that such success required "a moist and comparatively cool atmosphere", similar to that of its native environment.

"Drosera regia" is often described as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, "D. regia" appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. <a href="Plant%20propagation">Asexual propagation</a> is frequently achieved through small <a href="cutting%20%28plant%29">root cuttings</a> instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed <a href="germination">germination</a> occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other "Drosera" species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being <a href="phyllotaxis">alternate</a> in arrangement.

In 2004, William Joseph Clemens registered the only <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> of this species, "D. regia" 'Big Easy'. It is reputed to be more robust than other clones of the species and is also more compact with maximum leaf lengths of . Under his culture conditions, 'Big Easy' has also never flowered or gone dormant. Clemens originally obtained his "D. regia" from a vendor at the <a href="International%20Carnivorous%20Plant%20Society">International Carnivorous Plant Society</a> conference held in 2000. After sufficient investigation, he registered the new cultivar in a 2004 issue of the "<a href="Carnivorous%20Plant%20Newsletter">Carnivorous Plant Newsletter</a>", the quarterly publication of the International Carnivorous Plant Society.

Hex Enduction Hour

Hex Enduction Hour is the fourth studio album by the English <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> band <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">the Fall</a>. Released on 8 March 1982, it builds on the <a href="low%20fidelity">low-fidelity</a> production values and caustic lyrical content of their earlier recordings, and features a two-drummer lineup. Frontman <a href="Mark%20E.%20Smith">Mark E. Smith</a> establishes an abrasive <a href="Northern%20England">Northern</a> aesthetic built in part from the 20th century literary traditions of <a href="Kitchen%20sink%20realism">kitchen sink realism</a> and <a href="magic%20realism">magic realism</a>. Smith described the album as an often-satirical but deliberate reaction to the contemporary music scene, a stand against "bland bastards like <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a> and <a href="Spandau%20Ballet">Spandau Ballet</a> ... [and] all that shit."

Initially intended as the group’s final album, recording for "Hex" began during a 1981 three-concert visit to Iceland, where Smith was inspired both by the otherworldliness of the island's landscape and the enthusiasm of an audience unaccustomed to visiting rock groups. The Fall recorded "Hip Priest", "Iceland" and non-album single "Look, Know" at the Hljóðriti studio in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, and the remaining tracks in a disused cinema in <a href="Hitchin">Hitchin</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. The album peaked at 71 on the UK charts and attracted the attention of several record labels.

By 1981, the Fall had released three critically acclaimed albums, but band leader <a href="Mark%20E%20Smith">Mark E Smith</a> felt the group was undervalued and poorly supported by their label <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade Records</a>, whom he regarded as "a bunch of well meaning but inept hippies". He felt constrained by the label's ethos and worried that the Fall were in danger of becoming "just another Rough Trade band". Smith made overtures to other labels, and found kindred adventurous spirits at small emergent label Kamera Records. Kamera's first release in November 1981 was the Fall's single "Lie Dream of a Casino Soul", which also featured drummer <a href="Karl%20Burns">Karl Burns</a> for the first time since "<a href="Live%20at%20the%20Witch%20Trials">Live at the Witch Trials</a>". Burns previously substituted for <a href="Paul%20Hanley%20%28musician%29">Paul Hanley</a> on a US tour when the latter was denied a visa for being too young, and upon the group's return to the UK, Smith suggested that Burns should stay on as a second drummer.
In September 1981, the Fall travelled to <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, Iceland for the first time to play three concerts, organised by <a href="Einar%20%C3%96rn%20Benediktsson">Einar Örn</a>. While in Reykjavík, the band recorded three new songs ("Hip Priest", "Iceland" and non-album single "Look, Know") at Hljóðriti studio. The studio, normally used by local folk artists, had lava walls (according to Smith, it resembled an igloo), a factor that gave it its otherworldly sound. Kamera agreed to pay costs for the rest of the recordings and hired producer <a href="Richard%20Mazda">Richard Mazda</a>, who suggested that the sessions would take place in disused cinema in Hitchin, known as Regal Sound Studio, as the ambience would resemble the band's live sound. According to critic John Doran, uncertainty around a record label seeps into the album's sound, the work of a band with a gun pressed to their heads.

"Hex Enduction Hour" takes influence from <a href="the%20Velvet%20Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>'s "<a href="Sister%20Ray">Sister Ray</a>", <a href="Captain%20Beefheart">Captain Beefheart</a> and the early 1970s <a href="Krautrock">Krautrock</a> band <a href="Can%20%28band%29">Can</a>. Smith has said that the title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word "Enduction" to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that "<a href="Hexagon">Hex</a>" was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" as "emerg[ing] like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and <a href="Low%20fidelity">low-fi</a> approach by Smith, <a href="Grant%20Showbiz">Grant Showbiz</a> and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a "well produced noise" that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he "could have done a better job on a <a href="multitrack%20recording">4-track</a> if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time."

The album was the Fall's first to include Karl Burns and Paul Hanley in the band's classic two-drummer lineup. Smith intended the album's lyrics "to be like reading a really good book. You have a couple of beers, sit down and immerse yourself. None of those fuckers Elvis Costello or Spandau Ballet did that". "Hex Enduction Hour" was written during an unusually prolific period in his career. Many of the tracks had already been dropped from the band's live set by the time they visited Australia and New Zealand in the autumn of 1982. The earlier single "Look, Know" was recorded during the Icelandic sessions but not included on the album. This was characteristic of Smith's "never look back" approach.
Opening track "The Classical" acts as a statement of intent similar to that in "Crap Rap 2/Like to Blow" from the Fall's debut album "Live at the Witch Trials". Whereas on the earlier song Smith described himself as "Northern white crap that talks back", in the opening lines of "Hex Enduction Hour" he complains that the fact that contemporary music lacks culture is his "brag", observing that a "taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office" and references "obligatory niggers", before accusingly shouting "Hey there, fuckface, hey there, fuckface". <a href="Pavement%20%28band%29">Pavement</a> released a sanitised cover of the track in the early 1990s; Smith later dismissed them as mere Fall copyists. "Jawbone and the Air Rifle" depicts a nightmarish folklore tale of a poacher (described as a "rabbit killer") bored by a decades-old marriage who escapes by roaming the local countryside at night hunting prey. One night the protagonist "lets out a misplaced shot", which draws the <a href="Curse">Hex</a> of the "Broken Brothers Pentacle Church". The song's main focal point is toward the end when the lyrics detail a series of semi-religious, semi-pagan horrific and repeating hallucinations.

"Hip Priest" was recorded in Iceland in a single take, and is one of Smith's most personal songs, apparently written in bemusement following a recent rise in the band's popularity. The track has been compared to <a href="Dub%20music">dub</a> but in its Northern bleakness "it had been invented in a drizzly motorway rather than in recording studios in Jamaica." "Hip Priest" was re-recorded in 1988 in a <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> style as "Big New Prinz" for the album "<a href="I%20Am%20Kurious%20Oranj">I Am Kurious Oranj</a>". An excerpt of "Hip Priest" was used in 1991 in the climactic end scene of <a href="Jonathan%20Demme">Jonathan Demme</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>".

"Fortress/Deer Park" starts with a <a href="Casio%20VL-1">Casio VL-1</a> rhythm preset, the same as used by <a href="Trio%20%28band%29">Trio</a> on the 1982 hit single "<a href="Da%20Da%20Da">Da Da Da</a>". Its lyrics form a broad and jaundiced look at English culture and <a href="subculture">subculture</a>s in the early 1980s. It mentions "Good King Harry was there, fucking <a href="Jimmy%20Savile">Jimmy Savile</a>" while the lines "I took a walk down <a href="W%20postcode%20area">W11</a>; I had to walk through 500 European punks" are a <a href="deadpan">dry put-down</a> of the fashion-oriented.
"Winter" is split into two parts, broken by a fade out and fade in: "Winter (Hostel-Maxi)" closes Side 1 of the record and "Winter 2" opens Side 2. It was described by Smith in early press releases as "concerning an insane child who is taken over by a spirit from the mind of a cooped-up alcoholic". During the intro of "Winter (Hostel-Maxi)", the narrator describes waiting, <a href="Hangover">hung over</a>, in the early afternoon for the pubs to open. The remainder of the song consists of descriptions of and encounters with a <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">dry-out house</a>, a cleaning lady, a feminist with anti-nicotine and anti-nuclear stickers on her car and a "half-wit" child. After that, the lyrics move towards <a href="magic%20realism">magic realism</a> and ad-libbed inscrutability: "The mad kid had four lights: the average is two point-five-lights; the mediocre is two lights".

"Who Makes the Nazis" concludes that Nazis are born of "intellectual halfwits". The track contains a number of sounds played through a <a href="dictaphone">dictaphone</a>, a device that was to feature heavily in later Fall albums, most notably "<a href="This%20Nation%27s%20Saving%20Grace">This Nation's Saving Grace</a>".

"Iceland" was improvised in a single take. Smith was taken by a country that he described in 2008 as still inaccessible and "totally unlike what it is now. Beer was against the law. You could only drink shit like pints of <a href="peach%20schnapps">peach schnapps</a>". It consists of a two-note piano figure and a banjo part, over which Smith played a tape recording he had made of the wind howling outside his bedroom window. According to guitarist <a href="Marc%20Riley">Marc Riley</a>, "He [Smith] just said he needed a tune, something <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Dylan</a>ish, and we knocked around on the piano in the studio and came up with that. But we hadn't heard the words until he suddenly did them." The line "Fall down flat in the Cafe aisle without a glance from the clientele" describes an incident that had happened to Smith that morning. He had tripped in a nearby cafe and fallen across several tables. He was surprised by the lack of response from the other customers, who seemed to have dismissed him as just another drunk.

The closing track, "And This Day", originally lasted about 25 minutes, but was edited down to ten minutes to fit the album's length; it still remains one of the Fall's longest studio songs.

"Hex Enduction Hour"'s all-white cover with scribbles was described by music critic Robertson as "meticulously shoddy". It consists of a series of pen scribbles laid down by Smith. The markings are mostly random rhetorical phrases and sentence fragments such as "Lie-Dream 80% of 10% OR 6% over no less than 1/4 = ??????", "Hail Sainsbury's!", "CHUMMY LIFESTYLE", "HAVE A BLEEDIN GUESS" and "CIGS. SMOKED HERE". In an interview with "Sounds" that summer, Smith mentioned that he liked artwork to reflect the album content and that his graphic choices reflected his attitude to music. He mentioned how he was drawn to cheap and misspelled posters, amateur layouts of local papers and printed <a href="Cash%20and%20carry%20%28wholesale%29">cash and carry</a> signs with "inverted commas where you don't need them".

The album art was seen by many within the industry as coarse and lacking accepted layout or typographical qualities. <a href="HMV">HMV</a> would only shelve the sleeve back to front on their racking shelves.

"Hex Enduction Hour" was the first Fall album to make the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, reflecting a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career brought them to the attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could "have hardly been more supportive". Reviewing the album in the "<a href="NME">NME</a>", <a href="Richard%20Cook%20%28journalist%29">Richard Cook</a> described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, "their master piece to date", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"s <a href="Colin%20Irwin%20%28journalist%29">Colin Irwin</a> said it was "incredibly exciting and utterly compelling". A dissenter was <a href="Neil%20McCormick">Neil McCormick</a> of Irish fortnightly "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>, w"ho dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was "meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music."

Later, "<a href="Record%20Collector">Record Collector</a>" described the album as a "taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise. "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>", in 2009, wrote of the album as "arguably ... The Fall's mightiest hour", while "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" wrote that ""Hex" demonstrates the culmination of 'early' Fall: a monolithic beast of ragged grooves piloted through the embittering miasma of English society by the verbose acidity/<a href="Joycean">Joycean</a> all-inclusiveness of Mark E. Smith." "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork</a>" listed "Hex Enduction Hour" as the 33rd best album of the 1980s. Comedian <a href="Stewart%20Lee">Stewart Lee</a> has called it his favourite album and "probably the best album of all time."

According to Smith, the album's lyrics had a negative impact on the band's later career. In 1984, <a href="Motown%20Records">Motown Records</a> expressed interest in signing the band to a new UK division, with a provisional offer of a £46,000 up-front advance. A label executive asked to hear something from the Fall's back catalogue, but "Hex" was the only album Smith had available; he remembered thinking, "when he hears that, we've had it." The rejection letter stated that the label saw "no commercial potential in this band whatsoever". Smith believes this was due to the "obligatory niggers" line from the opening track "The Classical".

The album went out of print when the Kamera label folded in 1983, but a German edition on the Line imprint remained available, with copies pressed on white vinyl. Line issued a CD edition, flat transferred from a later generation tape. In 2002, a new edition titled "Hex Enduction Hour +" (adding both sides of the "Look, Know" single) was released via Smith's Cog Sinister imprint.

The album was remastered and issued in 2005 by <a href="Sanctuary%20Records%20Group">Sanctuary Records</a>, along with a disc of bonus live material. Smith conceded that the remastering was an improvement, but when asked if he liked the bonus live tracks he admitted that he hadn't listened "that far". For unexplained reasons, "Look, Know" was removed from the bonus material, although its b-side remained intact; however it would later appear on "The Fall Box Set 1976-2007".

Shoshone National Forest

Shoshone National Forest ( ) is the first <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federally</a> protected <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forest</a> in the United States and covers nearly in the <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> of <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. Originally a part of the <a href="Yellowstone%20Timberland%20Reserve">Yellowstone Timberland Reserve</a>, the forest is managed by the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> and was created by an act of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and signed into law by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> in 1891. Shoshone National Forest is one of the first nationally protected land areas anywhere. <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>s have lived in the region for at least 10,000 years, and when the region was first explored by European adventurers, forestlands were occupied by several different tribes. Never heavily settled or exploited, the forest has retained most of its wildness. Shoshone National Forest is a part of the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, a nearly unbroken expanse of federally protected lands encompassing an estimated .

The <a href="Absaroka%20Mountains">Absaroka</a> and <a href="Beartooth%20Mountains">Beartooth Mountains</a> are partly in the northern section of the forest. The <a href="Wind%20River%20Range">Wind River Range</a> is in the southern portion and contains <a href="Gannett%20Peak">Gannett Peak</a>, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a> separates the forest from its neighbor <a href="Bridger-Teton%20National%20Forest">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a> to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> and the <a href="Wind%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Wind River Indian Reservation</a>, which belongs to the <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> and <a href="Arapahoe">Arapahoe</a> Indians. <a href="Custer%20National%20Forest">Custer National Forest</a> along the <a href="Montana">Montana</a> border is on the northern frontier. The <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>, the 19th century <a href="covered%20wagon">covered wagon</a> route, passes just south of the forest, where broad and gentle <a href="South%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">South Pass</a> allowed the migrants to bypass the rugged mountains to the north.

Shoshone National Forest has virtually all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as <a href="John%20Colter">John Colter</a> and <a href="Jim%20Bridger">Jim Bridger</a> first visited the region. The forest is home to the <a href="Grizzly%20bear">Grizzly bear</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, tens of thousands of <a href="elk">elk</a> as well as the largest herd of <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a> in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a>. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> areas within the forest, protecting more than half of the <a href="land%20management">managed land</a> area from development. From <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a> plains through dense <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a> forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> rarely matched in any protected area.

Shoshone National Forest is named after the <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone Indians</a>, who, along with other <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups such as the <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a>, <a href="Crow%20Tribe">Crow</a> and <a href="Northern%20Cheyenne">Northern Cheyenne</a>, were the major tribes encountered by the first white explorers into the region. <a href="Archaeology">Archeological</a> evidence suggests that the presence of Indian tribes in the area extends back at least 10,000 years. The forest provided an abundance of game meat, wood products, and shelter during the winter months from the more exposed <a href="Great%20Plains">high plains</a> to the east. Portions of the more mountainous regions were frequented by the Shoshone and Sioux for spiritual healing and <a href="vision%20quest">vision quest</a>s. By the early 1840s, <a href="Washakie">Washakie</a> had become the leader of the easternmost branch of the Shoshone Indians. At the <a href="Fort%20Bridger%20Treaty%20Council%20of%201868">Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868</a> Washakie negotiated with the U.S. Government for ) to be preserved as tribal lands. Subsequent amendments to the treaty reduced the actual acreage to approximately and is known today as the <a href="Wind%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Wind River Indian Reservation</a>.

In 1957, <a href="Mummy%20Cave">Mummy Cave</a> was rediscovered by a local resident on the north side of the North Fork Shoshone River, adjacent to U.S. Routes <a href="U.S.%20Route%2014">14</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2016">16</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2020">20</a>, east of Yellowstone National Park. Subsequent archeological excavations in the 1960s produced evidence that the cave had been occupied for over 9,000 years. The oldest deposits in the cave yielded <a href="prismatic%20blade">prismatic stone blades</a> and other artifacts created by paleoindians and the surrounding soils were <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to 7,300 BC. The evidence indicates the cave was occupied from at least 7280 BC to 1580 AD. Besides projectile points, the cave also produced well preserved feathers, animal hides and other usually perishable materials. Additionally, the mummified remains of an individual buried inside a rock <a href="cairn">cairn</a> were unearthed, which were dated to 800 AD. Considered one of the finest paleoindian archeological assemblages in the Rocky Mountain region, the site was placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> list in 1981.

In the early 19th century, the forest was visited by <a href="mountain%20man">mountain men</a> and explorers such as <a href="John%20Colter">John Colter</a> and <a href="Jim%20Bridger">Jim Bridger</a>. Colter is the first white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the <a href="Absaroka%20Mountains">Absaroka Mountains</a>, crossing over <a href="Togwotee%20Pass">Togwotee Pass</a> and entering the valley known today as <a href="Jackson%20Hole">Jackson Hole</a>. Colter survived a <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> attack and a pursuit by a band of <a href="Blackfoot%20Confederacy">Blackfeet</a> Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.

Travels by <a href="fur%20trade">fur trappers</a> and adventurers, such as <a href="Manuel%20Lisa">Manuel Lisa</a> and Jim Bridger from 1807 to 1840, completed the exploration of the region. With the decline of the fur trade in the late 1840s and much of the prized <a href="beaver">beaver</a> long since made scarce by over-trapping, few white explorers entered the forest over the next few decades. The first federally financed expedition which passed through portions of Shoshone National Forest was the <a href="Raynolds%20Expedition">Raynolds Expedition</a> of 1860, led by <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers%23Corps%20of%20Topographical%20Engineers">topographical engineer</a> Captain <a href="William%20F.%20Raynolds">William F. Raynolds</a>. The expedition included geologist and naturalist <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden</a> and was guided by mountain man Jim Bridger. Though the Raynolds Expedition was focused on exploration of the Yellowstone region, several efforts to enter what later became Yellowstone National Park were impeded by heavy snows across the mountain passes such as <a href="Two%20Ocean%20Pass">Two Ocean Pass</a>. The expedition finally crossed the northern Wind River Range at a pass they named <a href="Union%20Pass">Union Pass</a> and entered Jackson Hole valley to the south of Yellowstone. Hayden led another expedition through the region in 1871. Hayden was primarily interested in documenting the Yellowstone country west of the forest, but his expedition also established that the forest was a prime resource that merited protection. Travels in the forest in the 1880s by later U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who was also a strong advocate of land <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation</a>, as well as by General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, provided the impetus that subsequently established the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve in 1891, creating the first national forest in the U.S.

In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly expanded the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> in 1905, the reserve was designated a <a href="United%20States%20National%20Forest">National Forest</a>, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A remnant of the earliest years of the forest management is the <a href="Wapiti%20Ranger%20Station">Wapiti Ranger Station</a> which is located west of <a href="Cody%2C%20Wyoming">Cody, Wyoming</a>. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>.

Prior to the establishment of the Wind River Indian Reservation, the <a href="United%20States%20Cavalry">U.S. Cavalry</a> constructed Fort Brown on the reservation lands, which was subsequently renamed <a href="Fort%20Washakie">Fort Washakie</a>. During the late 19th century, the fort was staffed by <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> members of the U.S. Cavalry, better known as the <a href="Buffalo%20Soldiers">Buffalo Soldiers</a>, including the second African-American graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>, <a href="John%20Hanks%20Alexander">John Hanks Alexander</a>. Chief Washakie is buried at the fort, which is located immediately east of the forest boundary. Rumor has it that <a href="Sacajawea">Sacajawea</a>, the Shoshone Indian who provided invaluable assistance to <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a> and <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a> during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is also buried here, but it is now considered that this is unlikely and that her actual burial place was <a href="Fort%20Lisa%20%28North%20Dakota%29">Fort Lisa</a> in North Dakota.

During the last decade of the 19th century, minerals such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but <a href="placer%20mining">panning</a> for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> to help combat unemployment during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.

Shoshone National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency within the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. The forest is separated into five districts and from 2008 and 2012 had an average staff of 165 employees and an annual operating budget of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>17,500,000. The headquarters and a visitor center are in Cody, Wyoming and a smaller information center is in <a href="Lander%2C%20Wyoming">Lander, Wyoming</a>. There are local ranger district offices in Cody, <a href="Dubois%2C%20Wyoming">Dubois</a> and Lander.

Shoshone National Forest practices <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation</a> of resources, which ensures a sustainable flow of some raw materials from the forest, such as lumber for construction purposes and <a href="wood%20pulp">wood pulp</a> for paper products. The forest averages an annual harvest of 4.5 million board-feet of timber for the purposes of commercial log home construction and another 2.5 million board-feet of wood collection from dead and down trees that are used for firewood and poles. Additionally, low-scale mineral extraction and <a href="oil%20exploration">oil</a> and <a href="natural%20gas">gas</a> exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Shoshone National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Only of oil and gas leases were filed as of 2013. More common than logging and mining are the lease options that are offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep. The U.S. Forest Service provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not <a href="overexploited">overexploited</a> and that necessary commodities are available for future generations, though conservation groups have voiced concerns over the management practices of the leasing program and especially cattle overgrazing problems. Leases for sheep grazing have declined considerably since the 1940s while cattle grazing has remained relatively constant.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from , which is more than , the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a> and <a href="grassland">grass</a>-dominated <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a> types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a>, which along with <a href="Juniperus%20scopulorum">Rocky Mountain juniper</a>, and <a href="Aspen">quaking aspen</a> are found at elevations up to . At higher elevations <a href="subalpine%20fir">subalpine fir</a>, <a href="Engelmann%20spruce">Engelmann spruce</a>, <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a> and <a href="limber%20pine">limber pine</a>, are common, each occurring up to <a href="tree%20line">timberline</a>. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation <a href="riparian">riparian</a> corridors, <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwoods</a> and <a href="willow">willow</a>s are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are <a href="endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a> to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the <a href="Draba">whitlow grass</a>, <a href="Brassicaceae">fremont bladderpod</a>, shoshonea, and the <a href="Asteraceae">north fork Easter daisy</a> provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.

<a href="Exotic%20species">Exotic species</a> of flora that are not native to the region include <a href="Cirsium%20arvense">Canada thistle</a>, <a href="Carduus%20nutans">Musk thistle</a>, <a href="Centaurea%20maculosa">Spotted knapweed</a>, <a href="Euphorbia%20esula">Leafy spurge</a> and <a href="Linaria%20vulgaris">Yellow toadflax</a>. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a> are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, <a href="Dendroctonus%20rufipennis">spruce bark beetle</a> and <a href="Dendroctonus%20pseudotsugae">Douglas fir beetle</a>, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100 percent of the trees in the impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.

Since the migration of the <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a> into Shoshone National Forest after the successful <a href="wolf%20reintroduction">wolf reintroduction</a> program in the Yellowstone region commenced in the mid-1990s, all of the known 70 <a href="mammal">mammal</a> species that existed prior to white settlement still exist in the forest. Altogether, at least 335 species of wildlife call Shoshone National Forest their home, including the largest population of <a href="Bighorn%20sheep">Bighorn sheep</a> and one of the few locations <a href="Grizzly%20bear">Grizzly bear</a>s can still be found in the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous U. S.</a>.

At least 700 grizzly bears are believed to exist in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes Shoshone National Forest, with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest. The grizzly is listed as a <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a> by the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, and the forest is one of their last strongholds. For what are considered to be "nuisance bears", non-lethal traps are set to capture them so that they can be relocated to remote areas, away from civilization. In the case of the grizzly, each captured bear is tranquilized and then <a href="ear%20tag">ear tag</a>ged with an identifying number. Each number is registered, and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety, they are exterminated. The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities. This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>. An active management program, in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears. Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds, and <a href="bear-resistant%20food%20storage%20container">bear-proof</a> trash receptacles are located in the front-country zones throughout the forest. In the <a href="backcountry">backcountry</a>, food must be stored some distance from campsites, and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters.
<a href="North%20American%20cougar">Cougar</a>s and <a href="northwestern%20wolf">timber wolves</a> are large <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s that inhabit the forest. Since the 1990s wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park, wolves have migrated into the forest and established permanent packs. Approximately a dozen wolf packs totaling 70 individual wolves were documented in the forest in 2012. The wolf was delisted as endangered once their population levels had reached management objectives and limited hunting of wolves was permitted in the forest starting in 2012. Cougars are generally nocturnal and rarely seen but hunting of this species is also allowed in highly regulated harvests. Wolverines are rare and elusive so documentation is often only from their tracks. The <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canada lynx</a> was native to the forest, but no known populations may still exist due to the rarity of its primary food source, the <a href="Snowshoe%20hare">Snowshoe hare</a>. Shoshone National Forest is considered critical habitat for lynx recovery since the species is listed as threatened under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> and the forest is in their historical range. Other generally carnivorous mammals include <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>, <a href="marten">marten</a>, <a href="ferret">ferret</a> and <a href="American%20badger">badger</a>.

Omnivorous mammals such as the <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a> and <a href="Western%20spotted%20skunk">skunk</a> and herbivore mammal species such as the <a href="North%20American%20porcupine">porcupine</a> and <a href="American%20pika">pika</a>, are common to the forest. The <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a> is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the <a href="moose">moose</a>, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.

Native herbivores such as the moose are found in small numbers near waterways, especially at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America have been on the decline since the end of the 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 <a href="elk">elk</a> (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>. Bighorn sheep and <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a>s inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">lower 48 states</a> congregate in the region around <a href="Dubois%2C%20Wyoming">Dubois, Wyoming</a>; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. <a href="Bison">Bison</a> and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a> antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.

An estimated 300 species of birds are found in the forest at least part of the year. <a href="Bald%20eagle">Bald eagle</a>, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="Swainson%E2%80%99s%20hawk">Swainson’s hawk</a> and the <a href="prairie%20falcon">prairie falcon</a> are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as <a href="Western%20grebe">Western grebe</a>, <a href="Northern%20pintail">Northern pintail</a>, <a href="Great%20blue%20heron">Great blue heron</a> and <a href="Barrow%E2%80%99s%20goldeneye">Barrow’s goldeneye</a> have stable populations and rare sightings of <a href="Trumpeter%20swan">Trumpeter swan</a>s are reported. <a href="Common%20pheasant">pheasant</a>, <a href="ruffed%20grouse">ruffed grouse</a> and <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> are widely distributed across the open sage lands. <a href="Harlequin%20duck">Harlequin duck</a> and <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a> are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.
Fish found in Shoshone National Forest include at least six species and subspecies of trout including <a href="Rainbow%20trout">rainbow</a>, <a href="Brook%20trout">brook</a> and <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>. The <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a> is widespread throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, but in the forest is mostly limited to the <a href="Shoshone%20River">Shoshone River</a>. The <a href="Coregonus">mountain whitefish</a> is also found in the Shoshone River, while the <a href="burbot">burbot</a> is found in two streams in the southern regions of the forest.

There are more than a dozen species of <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s in the forest including the venomous <a href="Rattlesnake">prairie rattlesnake</a> which can be found at lower elevations. The <a href="Painted%20turtle">western painted</a> and the <a href="Box%20turtle">ornate box turtle</a> are turtle species known to exist and about eight species of lizards such as the <a href="greater%20short-horned%20lizard">greater short-horned lizard</a> have been documented. Amphibians such as the <a href="Frog">Columbia spotted frog</a> and the <a href="Toad">boreal toad</a> are considered species of concern because of their high susceptibility to disease, habitat loss and human introduced toxins. Boreal toads are found at elevations of between and the Columbia spotted frog can live at elevations as high as in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Exotic species of fauna such as the <a href="Zebra%20mussel">zebra</a> and <a href="quagga%20mussel">quagga mussel</a>s and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20mud%20snail">New Zealand mud snail</a> are invasive species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail has been found in the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways.

The forest contains four areas of pristine <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> that have remained largely untouched by human activities such as mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the <a href="North%20Absaroka%20Wilderness">North Absaroka</a>, <a href="Washakie%20Wilderness">Washakie</a>, <a href="Fitzpatrick%20Wilderness">Fitzpatrick</a> and <a href="Popo%20Agie%20Wilderness">Popo Agie Wilderness</a>es. Additionally, a small portion of the <a href="Absaroka-Beartooth%20Wilderness">Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness</a> extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56 percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.

The <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act of 1964</a> enhanced the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or <a href="mining">extraction</a>, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including even bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or <a href="equestrianism">horseback</a>. <a href="Hunting">Hunting</a> and <a href="fishing">fishing</a> are permitted in the wilderness, just as they are throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits.

Fire Management officials in Shoshone National Forest recognize that <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a>s are a natural part of the ecosystem; however, this was not always the case. 20th century fire fighting efforts, especially in the first half of that century, emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, as fire was seen as completely detrimental to a forest. In 1935, fire management officials established the "10 am rule" for all fires on federal lands, which recommended aggressive attack on fires and to have them controlled by 10 am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. However, this policy led to an increase in fuels because fires were often extinguished before they had a chance to burn out dead and dying old growth. It was in a stand of old growth fir trees in Shoshone National Forest that the <a href="Blackwater%20fire%20of%201937">Blackwater fire of 1937</a> killed 15 fighters during a firestorm west of Cody, Wyoming. The fire was one of the deadliest in terms of forest firefighter deaths in U.S. history.

Between the years 1970 and 2012, Shoshone National Forest averaged 25 fires annually, of which half were due to natural ignition from lightning, which accounted for 90 percent of the total acreage burned. The remaining acreage that burned was due to campfires that got out of control or from other causes. In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of burns annually, with the worst year in the past century being 1988, when burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the <a href="Yellowstone%20fires%20of%201988">Yellowstone region fires of 1988</a>, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a <a href="controlled%20burn">controlled burn</a> plans to reduce the chances of a catastrophic fire. The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of bark beetle may have a great impact on future forest fires. Fire managers have stated the worst time for increased fire activity is 1–2 years after the trees are killed and then again after the trees have fallen many years later.

Shoshone National Forest borders <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> and <a href="Bridger-Teton%20National%20Forest">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a> to the west. The <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a> demarks the boundary between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. Along the <a href="Montana">Montana</a> border, Shoshone National Forest borders <a href="Custer%20National%20Forest">Custer National Forest</a> to the north. Private property, property belonging to the state of Wyoming and lands administered by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> form the eastern boundaries. Lastly, the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.

The altitude in the forest ranges from near Cody, Wyoming, to at the top of <a href="Gannett%20Peak">Gannett Peak</a>, an elevation gain of over . Of the three major <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>s found in the forest, they are <a href="geology">geologically</a> distinct from each other. All of the mountains are a part of the Rocky Mountains. In the northern and central portions of the forest lie the <a href="Absaroka%20Mountains">Absaroka Mountains</a> which were named after the <a href="Crow%20tribe">Crow</a> Indian tribe. The majority of the Absaroka Mountains are contained within the forest, with the highest peak being <a href="Francs%20Peak">Francs Peak</a> at . The peaks of the Absaroka are <a href="basaltic">basaltic</a> in origin, having been the result of volcanic activity estimated to have occurred 50 million years ago during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a>. The rocks are composed of mostly <a href="andesite">andesite</a> and <a href="breccia">breccia</a>s deposited for millions of years during volcanic events and are atop more ancient <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s that are considered to have economically viable mineral wealth. Gold was mined from the slopes of Francs Peak between the years 1890 and 1915, and the small <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a> of Kirwin remains as a legacy of that period. Major tributaries of the <a href="Bighorn%20River">Bighorn River</a>, such as the Shoshone and <a href="Greybull%20River">Greybull River</a>s, originate in the Absaroka Mountains. Important <a href="mountain%20pass">passes</a> through the Absarokas include <a href="Sylvan%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">Sylvan Pass</a>, which leads to the eastern entrance of Yellowstone National Park; and <a href="Togwotee%20Pass">Togwotee Pass</a>, which provides access to Jackson Hole and <a href="Grand%20Teton%20National%20Park">Grand Teton National Park</a>. 
In the far north of Shoshone National Forest a small portion of the Beartooth Mountains are located north of the <a href="Clarks%20Fork%20of%20the%20Yellowstone%20River">Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River</a>. The Beartooths are composed of <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> <a href="granite">granitic</a> rocks that are amongst the oldest found on Earth. Although often considered a part of the Absaroka Mountains, the Beartooths are distinct in appearance and geologic history. Uplifted approximately 70 million years ago during the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a>, the Beartooths consist of vast windswept plateaus and rugged peaks with sheer cliff faces. The <a href="Beartooth%20Highway">Beartooth Highway</a> (<a href="U.S.%20Highway%20212%20%28Wyoming%29">U.S. Highway 212</a>) crosses Beartooth Pass, and from there descends to the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park.
The Wind River Range is in the southern portion of the forest and is composed primarily of Precambrian granitic rock. Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming, is in the northern part of the range. Altogether eight peaks exceed and 119 rise at least above sea level. <a href="Fremont%20Peak%20%28Wyoming%29">Fremont Peak</a>, the second highest peak in the range, was originally believed to be the tallest mountain in the Rocky Mountains due to its prominence when viewed from the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> by early pioneers. The Wind River Range is popular with mountain climbers because of its solid rock and variety of routes. The <a href="Cirque%20of%20the%20Towers">Cirque of the Towers</a> in the <a href="Popo%20Agie%20Wilderness">Popo Agie Wilderness</a> is one of the more popular climbing and hiking destinations, and an estimated 200 different climbing routes are located within the peaks that surround the <a href="cirque%20%28landform%29">cirque</a>.

There are over 500 lakes in the forest, and of streams and rivers. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River is federally designated as a <a href="National%20Wild%20and%20Scenic%20Rivers%20System">Wild and Scenic River</a> for through the forest, with cliffs towering up to as the river winds through a gorge. The forest is on the eastern slopes of the Continental Divide, and the rivers flow into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean basin</a>.

According to the U.S. Forest Service, Shoshone National Forest has the greatest number of glaciers of any National Forest in the Rocky Mountains. The forest recreation guide lists 16 named and 140 unnamed glaciers within the forest, all in the Wind River Range. Forty-four of these glaciers are in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, centered around the highest mountain peaks. However, the state water board for Wyoming lists only 63 glaciers for the entire Wind River Range, which includes glaciers in adjacent Bridger-Teton National Forest. Researchers claim that for most of the period that glaciers have been known to exist in the forest, that they have been in a state of general retreat, with glacial mass losses of as much as 25 percent between the years 1985 and 2009.

Reversing the growth of mid-latitude glaciers that occurred during the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a> (1350–1850), there has been a <a href="Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850">worldwide reduction of mountain glacial ice</a> since, with some regions losing as much as 50 percent of their peak ice cover. This can be correlated by examining <a href="photography">photographic</a> evidence of glaciers taken over time even with an absence of other means of documentation. The behavior of the glaciers of Shoshone National Forest is consistent with this pattern. In one study of <a href="Dinwoody%20Glacier">Dinwoody</a> and <a href="Gannett%20Glacier">Gannett Glacier</a>s, during the period from 1958 to 1983, the thickness of these glaciers was reduced , respectively. 
Gannett Glacier, on the northeast slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50 percent of its volume since 1920 with 25 percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. <a href="Upper%20Fremont%20Glacier">Upper Fremont Glacier</a> has been studied more than any other glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a>s from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the <a href="Quelccaya%20Ice%20Cap">Quelccaya Ice Cap</a> in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.

The small glaciers in the forest are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find <a href="glacier%20mass%20balance">mass balance</a> (<a href="accumulation%20zone">accumulation</a> versus <a href="ablation">melting</a> rate) at any size. Without a favorable climate change, it will continue to retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the forest ecosystem over time.

Wyoming is an arid state, averaging of precipitation annually. However, Shoshone National Forest is located in and near some of the largest mountain ranges in the state, and consequently receives anywhere between annually. Higher elevations in the forest not only get more precipitation than lower elevations, but also have lower overall temperatures, with summertime highs around and lows near while lower elevations may be or warmer on average. Humidity levels throughout the forest are low, especially at higher altitudes. In the middle of the forest at the Wapiti Ranger Station, which is west of the forest headquarters in Cody, Wyoming, January high and low temperatures are , while the July highs and lows are . The annual precipitation at Wapiti is .

Most of the precipitation falls in the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous radiative cooling occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon. Consequently, the nights range from very cool in the summer to <a href="polar%20climate">extremely cold</a> in the winter; therefore, visitors should always remember to bring along at least a jacket, even during the summer. Records indicate that the highest temperature ever recorded in the forest was in 1978, while the coldest was in 1972.

Shoshone National Forest receives an average of over half a million visitors a year. Two visitor centers provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays. One visitor center is at the Wapiti Wayside on the <a href="Buffalo%20Bill%20Cody%20Scenic%20Byway">Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway</a>, west of Cody, Wyoming and adjacent to the historic Wapiti Ranger Station while the other visitor center is to the south in Lander, Wyoming. There are 30 vehicle access <a href="campground">campground</a>s in the forest, with up to 54 individual sites per campground. Approximately half of these campgrounds provide running water and restroom facilities and also provide for handicapped accessibility. Referred to as "front country" campgrounds, they also permit <a href="recreational%20vehicle">recreational vehicle</a> access in most cases. All of the campgrounds are on a first come, first served basis although four campgrounds have sites that can be reserved in advance by contacting the National Reservation Service. Due to the presence of grizzly bears, a few of the campgrounds require what is referred to as "hard-sided" camping only, and tent camping is not permitted.

For some visitors the greater solitude of the backcountry requires using <a href="Trail">hiking trails</a> to <a href="backpacking%20%28wilderness%29">backpacking</a> or horseback riding into more remote destinations such as <a href="Blackwater%20Natural%20Bridge">Blackwater Natural Bridge</a> which can be accessed from Blackwater Natural Bridge trailhead. There are dozens of trails which total over located throughout the forest. Many of the trailheads can be accessed at campgrounds, with shorter day hikes available as well. The <a href="Continental%20Divide%20Trail">Continental Divide Trail</a> has a section which passes through the forest and crosses the Continental Divide at Sheridan Pass. There is also the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail">Nez Perce National Historic Trail</a> and the Beartooth Loop National Recreation Trail, both of which are in the northern regions of the forest. Some remote areas can also be accessed by horseback. Trailheads usually provide enough room for horse and pack animal trailers plus personal vehicles. Along forest access roads, <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a>s (ATV) are allowed, but since wilderness areas do not permit access by way of motorized transport, those who wish to visit such areas usually do so either by hiking in or on horseback.

Hunting and fishing are popular recreational activities permitted throughout the forest. Many of the streams and rivers are considered to be "Blue Ribbon Trout Streams". Though many streams and lakes have excellent opportunities to catch various species of trout, the north and south forks of the Shoshone River, the Greybull River and the Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone, the only federally designated <a href="Wild%20and%20Scenic%20River">Wild and Scenic River</a> in Wyoming, are a few of the better locations to reign in a trophy level Rainbow or Yellowstone cutthroat trout. of streams and a hundred lakes that can be legally fished from provide plenty of elbow room during even the most crowded of fishing seasons. Hunting and fishing licenses are sponsored by the state of Wyoming and are available through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

The southern section of the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for <a href="mountaineering">mountain climbers</a>. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility of the region and complexity of the climbing effort.

Winter activities include <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a> and <a href="snowmobiling">snowmobiling</a>, with of groomed trails for cross-country skiing and over for use by snowmobilers. The region around Togwotee Pass allows snowmobilers easy access from paved roads and has snow depths of between annually at elevations of , which equates to a long season for winter activities.

Shoshone National Forest forms the eastern boundary of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances to the park are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byways">National Scenic Byways</a> <a href="All-American%20Road">All-American Road</a>, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. <a href="Chief%20Joseph%20Scenic%20Byway">Chief Joseph Scenic Byway</a> (<a href="Wyoming%20Highway%20296">Wyoming Highway 296</a>) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which <a href="Chief%20Joseph">Chief Joseph</a> and the <a href="Nez%20Perce%20tribe">Nez Perce tribe</a> attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the <a href="Wyoming%20Centennial%20Scenic%20Byway">Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway</a> (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway is the only one of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.

Sicilian Baroque

The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive <a href="1693%20Sicily%20earthquake">earthquake in 1693</a>. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and <a href="parochialism">parochial</a> manner, having evolved from <a href="Cross-genre">hybrid</a> native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassicism</a>.

The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the <a href="social%20order">social order</a> of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.

Baroque architecture is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>, the strategic use of light and shade on a building created by mass and shadow.

The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and <a href="palazzo">palazzi</a>, the private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, and <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words.


While these characteristics never occur all together in the same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.

Sicily, a volcanic island in the central <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, off the <a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italian peninsula</a>, has been colonised by the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a>, then it was under the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a>, the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>, the <a href="emirate%20of%20Sicily">Muslims</a>, the <a href="Italo-Normans">Normans</a>, the <a href="Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</a>, the <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Angevins</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Aragon">Aragonese</a>, after whom it became a province of the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> and then was part of the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a>, before finally being absorbed into the <a href="Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> in 1860. Thus Sicilians have been exposed to a rich sequence of disparate cultures; this is reflected in the extraordinary diversity of architecture on the island.

A form of decorated classical architecture peculiar to Sicily had begun to evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined <a href="Architecture%20of%20Ancient%20Greece">Greek architecture</a> and by the Norman <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>s on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the <a href="meander%20%28art%29">Greek key</a> pattern into late Norman architecture with <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> features such as pointed arches and window apertures. The <a href="Norman%20architecture%23Sicily">Sicilian Norman architecture</a> incorporated some <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> elements seldom found in Norman architecture elsewhere, and like other <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque architecture</a> it went on to incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate architecture differs from that of mainland Europe in not having evolved from <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance architecture</a>; instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance architecture hardly touched Sicily; in the capital city of <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a>, the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria, a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di Toleda by Florentine artists Franscesco Cammilliani and Michelangelo Naccerino and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old (Illustration 5).

Whatever the reason that Renaissance style never became popular in Sicily, it was certainly not ignorance. <a href="Antonello%20Gagini">Antonello Gagini</a> was midway through constructing the church of Santa Maria di Porto Salvo in 1536 in the Renaissance style when he died; he was superseded by the architect <a href="Antonio%20Scaglione">Antonio Scaglione</a>, who completed the building in a Norman style. This style seems to have influenced Sicilian architecture almost up to the time of the 1693 earthquake. Even <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> passed the island by. Only in the architecture of <a href="Messina">Messina</a> could a Renaissance influence be discerned, partly for geographical reasons: within sight of mainland Italy and the most important port in Sicily, Messina was always more amenable to the prevailing tides of fashion outside the island. The town's aristocratic patrons would often call on Florence or Rome to provide them with an architect; one example was the Florentine <a href="Giovanni%20Angelo%20Montorsoli">Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli</a>, who established the <a href="Tuscany">Tuscan</a> styles of architecture and sculpture there in the mid-16th century. However, these influences remained largely confined to Messina and the surrounding district. It seems likely that it was the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church, removed from the influences of Roman fashion, that remained conservative in architectural taste.

This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor <a href="Domenico%20Gagini">Domenico Gagini</a>, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), <a href="Antonello%20Gagini">Antonio Gagini</a> completed the <a href="proscenium">proscenium</a>-like arch of the "Capella della Madonna" in the "Santuario dell'Annunziata" at <a href="Trapani">Trapani</a>. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s — not <a href="Fluting%20%28architecture%29">fluted</a>, but decorated heavily with relief <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a>s of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining <a href="saint">saint</a>s supporting <a href="Garland%20%28decoration%29">swag</a>s linked to the central <a href="Escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29">shield</a> that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque.
Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The earliest example of Baroque on the island is <a href="Giulio%20Lasso">Giulio Lasso</a>'s "<a href="Quattro%20Canti">Quattro Canti</a>", an <a href="octagon">octagon</a>al <a href="piazza">piazza</a>, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the <a href="Crossroads%20%28culture%29">crossroads</a> of the city's two principal streets. Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and four matching buildings with identical <a href="Cant%20%28architecture%29">cant</a>ed corners. The sides of the four buildings are curved, further heightening the Baroque design of the buildings lining the circus. These four great buildings dominating the circus are each enhanced by a fountain, reminiscent of those of Pope <a href="Sixtus%20V">Sixtus V</a>'s "Quattro Fontane" in Rome. However, here in Palermo the Baroque theme continues up three storeys of the buildings, which are adorned with statues in recessed niches depicting the four seasons, the four Spanish <a href="King%20of%20Sicily">kings of Sicily</a>, and the four patronesses of Palermo: Saints <a href="Saint%20Christina%20of%20Bolsena">Cristina</a>, <a href="Saint%20Ninfa">Ninfa</a>, <a href="Saint%20Olivia">Olivia</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Agatha">Agata</a>.

While each façade of Quattro Canti is pleasing to the eye, as a scheme it is both out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, it is evident that during the 17th century, the Baroque style in the hands of the local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, and Russia, where <a href="Naryshkin%20baroque">Naryshkin Baroque</a> would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.

The great Sicilian <a href="1693%20Sicily%20earthquake">earthquake of 1693</a> destroyed at least 45 towns and cities, affecting an area of 5600 square kilometres and causing the deaths of about 60,000 people. The <a href="Epicenter">epicentre</a> of the disaster was offshore, although the exact position remains unknown. Towns which suffered severely were <a href="Ragusa%2C%20Italy">Ragusa</a>, <a href="Modica">Modica</a>, <a href="Scicli">Scicli</a>, and <a href="Ispica">Ispica</a>. Rebuilding began almost immediately.

The lavishness of the architecture that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy. This was led by the <a href="Giuseppe%20Lanza">Duke of Camastra</a>, whom the Spanish had appointed <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a> to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a <a href="gentry">gentry</a> class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a <a href="ruling%20class">ruling class</a> consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists even more. In addition to these were the younger <a href="Kinship%20and%20descent">scion</a>s of the families, with their courtesy titles of "nobile" or <a href="baron">baron</a>.

Architecture was not the only legacy of the <a href="Normans">Normans</a>. Rule over the peasants (there was no established middle class) was also enforced by a <a href="feudal%20system">feudal system</a>, unchanged since its introduction following the Norman conquest of 1071. Thus the Sicilian aristocracy had not only wealth but vast manpower at their command, something that had by this time declined in many other parts of Europe. As in Southern Spain, the huge rural estates remained almost as concentrated as when they had been Roman "latifundi". The Sicilian economy, though very largely agriculturally based, was very strong, and became more so during the 18th century as shipping became more efficient and the threat of Muslim piracy died away. The export markets for lemons (for the great 18th century fashion for <a href="lemonade">lemonade</a>) and wines increased greatly, and Sicilian wheat remained, as it had been since Roman times, the backbone of the economy. The disaster that was to give Sicily its modern reputation of poverty, namely the opening-up of the American Middle West to wheat-farming, was a century away. When it came, this permanently more than halved the price of wheat, and destroyed the old economy forever.

The aristocracy shared their power only with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops were members of the aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter <a href="monastery">monasteries</a> and <a href="convent">convent</a>s, in order to preserve the family <a href="Estate%20%28land%29">estates</a> from division; a large fee, or <a href="dowry">dowry</a>, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This is one of the reasons that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.

Once rebuilding began, the poor rebuilt their basic housing in the same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent six months of the year in Palermo and six in <a href="Catania">Catania</a>, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable <a href="enclave">enclave</a> at <a href="Bagheria">Bagheria</a>. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its <a href="zenith">zenith</a> in the mid-18th century.

Following the quake a program of rebuilding was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the <a href="Giuseppe%20Lanza">Duke of Camastra</a>, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer <a href="piazza">piazze</a> and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a <a href="hexagon">hexagon</a>, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of <a href="Grammichele">Grammichele</a> represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.

This concept was still very new in the 1690s, and few new cities had had reason to be built in Europe – <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>'s city plan after the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a> in 1666 having been turned down because of the complexities of land ownership there. There were some other examples such as <a href="Richelieu%2C%20Indre-et-Loire">Richelieu</a>, and later <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. The prototype may well have been the new city of <a href="Terra%20del%20Sole">Terra del Sole</a>, constructed in 1564. Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was <a href="Alessandria">Alessandria</a> in southern <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>. A little later, from 1711, this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America, especially by the Portuguese in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. In other parts of Europe, lack of finance, complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical replanning after disaster too difficult: after 1666, London was rebuilt on its ancient plan, though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system. In Sicily, public opinion (the public being anyone not a member of the ruling class) counted for nothing, and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed.

In Sicily, the decision was taken not just for fashion and appearance but also because it would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of <a href="Caltagirone">Caltagirone</a>, <a href="Militello%20in%20Val%20di%20Catania">Militello in Val di Catania</a>, <a href="Catania">Catania</a>, <a href="Modica">Modica</a>, <a href="Noto">Noto</a>, <a href="Palazzolo%20Acreide">Palazzolo Acreide</a>, <a href="Ragusa%2C%20Italy">Ragusa</a>, and <a href="Scicli">Scicli</a>.

One of the finest examples of this new urban planning can be seen at Noto (Illustration 9), the town rebuilt approximately 10 km from its original site on <a href="Mount%20Alveria">Mount Alveria</a>. The old ruined town now known as "Noto Antica" can still be viewed in its ruinous state. The new site chosen was flatter than the old to better facilitate a linear grid-like plan. The principal streets run east to west so they would benefit from a better light and a sunnier disposition. This example of town planning is directly attributable to a learned local aristocrat, <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Landolina">Giovanni Battista Landolina</a>; helped by three local architects, he is credited with planning the new city himself.
In these new towns, the aristocracy was allocated the higher areas, where the air was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the town centre (Illustration 8), for convenience to all, and to reflect the church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and <a href="Bishop">episcopal</a> "Palazzo Vescovile" were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, and members of the few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford building plots, often lived on the periphery of the commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally often these people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a> and <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> in English America, and most notably <a href="Haussmann%27s%20renovation%20of%20Paris">Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris</a>. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century.

Later many other Sicilian towns and cities which had been either little damaged or completely untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, was one of many in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured <a href="marble">marble</a>s.

Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it has been said, "The buildings conceived in the wake of this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror". While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of "joie de vivre" in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a> had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a>'s new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth, taste, or power. Thus it was the obvious choice for the "homeless rich" of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.

As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were employed to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style than those of the late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s by <a href="Domenico%20de%27%20Rossi">Domenico de' Rossi</a>, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.

At this stage of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Vaccarini">Giovanni Battista Vaccarini</a> was the leading Sicilian architect during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Bernini</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Borromini">Borromini</a>, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, which would have been unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the <a href="Palazzo%20Biscari">Palazzo Biscari</a> at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> from <a href="Camillo-Guarino%20Guarini">Guarino Guarini</a>'s "Architettura Civile". It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.

A second hindrance to Sicilian architects' fully achieving their potential earlier was that frequently they were only rebuilding a damaged structure, and as a consequence having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The <a href="Duomo%20of%20San%20Giorgio%2C%20Modica">Cathedral of San Giorgio</a> at <a href="Modica">Modica</a> (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, <a href="Rosario%20Gagliardi">Rosario Gagliardi</a> oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the <a href="Duomo%20of%20San%20Giorgio%2C%20Ragusa">church of San Giorgio</a> in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.

There were also at this time other influences at work. Between 1718 and 1734 Sicily was ruled personally by <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles VI</a> from <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, and as a result close ties with Austrian architecture can be perceived. Several buildings on the island are shameless imitations of the works of <a href="Johann%20Bernhard%20Fischer%20von%20Erlach">Fischer von Erlach</a>. Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach had begun to rebuild <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a> in 1686 in a simple form of Baroque; this form was later to be reproduced in Sicily in the final years of its Baroque era. The palace also had an external staircase (removed in 1746) similar to those that later evolved in Sicily. One Sicilian architect, <a href="Tommaso%20Napoli">Tommaso Napoli</a>, a monk, visited Vienna twice early in the century, returning with a store of engraving and drawings. He was later the architect of two country villas of the early Sicilian Baroque period, remarkable for their concave and convex walls and the complex design of their external staircases. One villa, his Villa Palagonia begun in 1705, is the most complex and ingenious of all constructed in Sicily's Baroque era; its double staircase of straight flights, frequently changing direction, was to be the prototype of a distinguishing feature of Sicilian Baroque.

Later, a new wave of architects, who would master the Baroque sentiments, aware of <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> interior styles beginning elsewhere to gain an ascendancy over Baroque, would go on to develop the flamboyance, freedom, and movement that are synonymous with the term Sicilian Baroque today.

Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included <a href="Andrea%20Palma">Andrea Palma</a>, <a href="Rosario%20Gagliardi">Rosario Gagliardi</a> and <a href="Tommaso%20Napoli">Tommaso Napoli</a>. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor <a href="Francesco%20de%20Sanctis%20%28architect%29">Francesco de Sanctis</a>'s <a href="Spanish%20Steps">Spanish Steps</a> in Rome.

Façades of churches often came to resemble <a href="wedding%20cake">wedding cake</a>s rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a> has described this decoration as "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more evident than in <a href="Ragusa%2C%20Italy">Ragusa</a> and <a href="Catania">Catania</a>.

<a href="Ragusa%2C%20Italy">Ragusa</a> was very badly damaged in 1693. The town is in two halves, divided by a deep ravine known as the "Valle dei Ponti": the older town of Ragusa Ibla, and the higher Ragusa Superiore.

Ragusa Ibla, the lower city, boasts an impressive array of Baroque architecture, which includes the <a href="Duomo%20of%20San%20Giorgio%2C%20Ragusa">Church of San Giorgio</a> by <a href="Rosario%20Gagliardi">Rosario Gagliardi</a>, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's <a href="topography">topography</a>. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Bernini</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Borromini">Borromini</a>. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.
In an alley connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore is the church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20delle%20Scale">Santa Maria delle Scale</a>. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.

The <a href="Palazzo%20Zacco">Palazzo Zacco</a> is one of the more notable Baroque buildings of the city, its <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian</a> <a href="column">column</a>s supporting <a href="balcony">balconies</a> of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of <a href="grotesque">grotesque</a>s mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the <a href="Zacco%20%28dynasty%29">Zacco</a> family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of <a href="acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> leaves from which a <a href="puttino">puttino</a> leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s which support them, ranging from <a href="putti">putti</a> to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a>. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.

The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore was built between 1718 and 1778. Its principal façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral has a high Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>d aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, is very different from the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> and neoclassical balconies.

Sicily's second city, Catania, was the most damaged of all the larger cities in 1693, with only the medieval <a href="Castello%20Ursino">Castello Ursino</a> and three <a href="tribune%20%28architecture%29">tribunes</a> of the cathedral remaining. Thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design separated the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Rebuilding was supervised by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Catania">Bishop of Catania</a>, and the city's only surviving architect, <a href="Alonzo%20di%20Benedetto">Alonzo di Benedetto</a>. Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the <a href="Seminary">Seminario</a> and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and it is impossible to distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th-century Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial. This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake.

In 1730, Vaccarini arrived in Catania as the appointed city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature rather than a general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> supported on the back of the Catanian <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is <a href="Stefano%20Ittar">Stefano Ittar</a>'s Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.

Sicilian church exteriors had been decorated in elaborate styles from the first quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>, <a href="stucco">stucco</a>, <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense ("compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15"), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of <a href="Porphyry%20%28geology%29">porphyry</a> are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the "pièce de resistance": in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> and <a href="agate">agate</a>. Steps leading to the altar <a href="dais">dais</a> are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.

The building of Sicily's churches would typically be funded not just by individual religious orders but also by an aristocratic family. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of Sicily's nobility did not choose to have their mortal remains displayed for eternity in the <a href="Capuchin%20catacombs%20of%20Palermo">Capuchin catacombs of Palermo</a>, but were buried quite conventionally in <a href="burial%20vault%20%28tomb%29">vaults</a> beneath their family churches. It has been said, though, that "the funeral of a Sicilian aristocrat was one of the great moments of his life". <a href="Funeral">Funeral</a>s became tremendous shows of wealth; a result of this ostentation was that the stone memorial slabs covering the burial vaults today provide an accurate barometer of the development of Baroque and marble inlay techniques at any specific time. For instance, those from the first half of the 17th century are of simple white marble decorated with an incised armorial bearing, name, date, etc. From c. 1650, small quantities of coloured marble inlay appear, forming patterns, and this can be studied developing until, by the end of the century, the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a> and calligraphy are entirely of inset coloured marble, with decorative patterned borders. Long after Baroque began to fall from fashion in the 1780s, Baroque decor was still deemed more suitable for Catholic ritual than the new pagan-based neoclassicism.

The Church of <a href="San%20Benedetto%20in%20Catania">San Benedetto in Catania</a> (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a fine example of a Sicilian Baroque interior, decorated between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist <a href="Giovanni%20Tuccari">Giovanni Tuccari</a>. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed in such a way that the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.

With but a few notable exceptions, the interiors of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they took so long to build and by the time they were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as "<a href="Pompeii">Pompeian</a>". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the <a href="ballroom">ballroom</a> wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by <a href="Andrea%20Giganti">Andrea Giganti</a> in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by <a href="Giuseppe%20Cristadoro">Giuseppe Cristadoro</a> with <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> scenes framed by Baroque <a href="gilding">gild</a>ed motifs in <a href="plaster">plaster</a>. This ceiling was already old-fashioned when it was finished, and the rest of the room was decorated in a far simpler mode. Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their interiors lost.

A further reason for the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most common, is that most rooms were never intended for such decoration. Many of the palazzi were vast, meant for huge numbers of people. The household of the Sicilian aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover, there were paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a <a href="major%20domo">major domo</a>, governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower servants, such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus many rooms were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even for the "Maestro and Maestra di Casa", were often simply decorated and furnished. Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any visiting foreigner, especially an Englishman, was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom empty or quiet.

As in the rest of Italy, the finest and most decorated rooms were those on the <a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large <a href="salon%20%28room%29">salon</a> being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, but by the end of the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s and <a href="shepherdess">shepherdess</a>es decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and <a href="fresco">fresco</a>ed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>s of <a href="Murano">Murano</a> glass, while further light came from gilded <a href="sconce%20%28light%20fixture%29">sconce</a>s flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's <a href="Palazzo%20Valguarnera-Gangi">Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi</a> (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by <a href="Gaspare%20Fumagalli">Gaspare Fumagalli</a> is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner <a href="Marianna%20Valguarnera">Marianna Valguarnera</a>, mostly in the later neoclassical style.

Furniture during the Baroque era was in keeping with the style: ornate, gilded and frequently with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a <a href="silk">silk</a> wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.

The common element to both church and palazzi interior design was the <a href="stucco">stucco</a> work. Stucco is an important component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with "<a href="trompe%20l%27oeil">trompe l'oeil</a>" ceilings and walls in <a href="Baroque%20illusionistic%20painting">Baroque illusionistic painting</a> confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.

Baroque eventually went out of fashion. In some parts of Europe, it metamorphosed into the <a href="rococo">rococo</a>, but not in Sicily. No longer ruled by Austria, Sicily, from 1735 officially the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, was ruled by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">King of Naples</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Naples">Ferdinand IV</a>. Hence Palermo was in constant association with the principal capital <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, where there was architecturally a growing reversion to the more classical styles of architecture. Coupled with this, many of the more cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with all things French, from philosophy to arts, fashion, and architecture. Many of them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest architectural engravings and theoretical treatises. The French architect <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Dufourny">Léon Dufourny</a> was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient <a href="Greek%20temple">Greek temple</a>s on the island. Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past, which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion. The change in tastes did not come about overnight. Baroque remained popular on the island, but now Sicilian balconies, extravagant as ever, would be placed next to severe classical columns. Dufourny began designing in Palermo, and his "Entrance Temple" (1789) to the Botanical Gardens was the first building in Sicily in a style based on the Greek Doric order. It is pure neoclassical architecture, as established in England since 1760, and it was a sign of things to come.

It was Dufourny's great friend and fellow architect <a href="Giuseppe%20Venanzio%20Marvuglia">Giuseppe Marvuglia</a> who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>. The main façade, punctuated by giant <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a>, and supported an undecorated <a href="entablature">entablature</a>. Above the windows were classical unbroken <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s. Sicilian Baroque was waning.

Another reason for the gradual decline in the development of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, to the detriment of the abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as <a href="surety">surety</a>, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak <a href="Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Naples">Ferdinand IV</a> and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to the point of no return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 <a href="British%20Army">British troops</a>, and Sicily was now ruled by <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first <a href="tax">tax</a>es, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.

The tax was rescinded by the British in 1812, who then imposed a British style <a href="constitution">constitution</a> on the island. One legal innovation of this time of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that <a href="creditor">creditor</a>s, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a <a href="loan">loan</a> or <a href="Mortgage%20loan">mortgage</a>, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at <a href="auction">auction</a>s, and consequently a land-owning <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a> in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with the social and political upheaval of the following <a href="Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a> in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of "<a href="noblesse%20oblige">noblesse oblige</a>", an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.

As with the early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first buildings of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.

Sicilian Baroque is today recognised as an architectural style, largely due to the work of <a href="Sacheverall%20Sitwell">Sacheverall Sitwell</a>, whose "Southern Baroque Art" of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt.

Most of the Baroque palazzi continued in private ownership throughout the 19th century, as the old aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt. There were a few exceptions and some of these retain the ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which they were designed.

However, much of the blame for the decay and ruinous state of preservation of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo <a href="palace%20of%20the%20Prince%20of%20Lampedusa">palace of the Prince of Lampedusa</a>, are still in ruins following the United States <a href="bombing">bombing</a> raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.

The remaining members of the Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism a major source of income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The <a href="Fondo%20per%20l%27Ambiente%20Italiano">local equivalent</a> of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.

As Sicily now becomes a more politically stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning to open their doors to an eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie "<a href="The%20Leopard%20%281963%20film%29">The Leopard</a>" was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set, but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events. Some palazzi are offering a <a href="bed%20and%20breakfast">bed and breakfast</a> service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose for which they were originally intended.

In 2002, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> selectively included Baroque monuments of <a href="Val%20di%20Noto">Val di Noto</a> into its <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage List</a> as "providing outstanding testimony to the exuberant genius of late Baroque art and architecture" and "representing the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe.

Monkey Gone to Heaven

"Monkey Gone to Heaven" is a song by the American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a> and is the seventh track on their 1989 album "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>". The song was written and sung by <a href="frontman">frontman</a> <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a> and was produced by <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a>. Referencing environmentalism and biblical numerology, the song's lyrics mirrored themes that were explored in "Doolittle". "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was the first Pixies song to feature guest musicians: two cellists, Arthur Fiacco and Ann Rorich, and two violinists, Karen Karlsrud and Corine Metter.

"Monkey Gone to Heaven" was released as the first <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> from "Doolittle" in the United States and United Kingdom. As the band had signed to <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> shortly before, the single also marked their first American and <a href="major%20label">major label</a> release. It was critically well-received; "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"'s David Fricke said "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage". In the years since its release, the song has received several accolades from music publications.

"Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main theme is <a href="environmentalism">environmentalism</a>. The song mainly deals with man's destruction of the ocean and "confusion of man's place in the universe". "On one hand, it's [the ocean] this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." Francis came up with the song's hook, "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to <a href="lead%20guitarist">lead guitarist</a> <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago's</a> apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: "It was early in the morning, I was still so tired. [Francis said] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and he was laughing. [...] It was hilarious".

"Monkey Gone to Heaven" includes references to numerology in the lyrics "If man is five/then the Devil is six/and God is seven". Francis later expanded on the significance of the lyrics in an interview to "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28music%20magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>", saying "It's a reference from what I understand to be <a href="Biblical%20Numerology">Hebrew numerology</a>, and I don't know a lot about it or any of it really. I just remember someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.

Ben Sisario, author of "Doolittle 33⅓", offers a slightly different interpretation of the song: "<a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">Neptune</a>, the god of this realm [in reference to Francis' ocean comment], the 'underwater guy who controlled the sea,' hung out down there, the personification of man's relationship with the earth. And what happens to Neptune? He gets 'killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York to New Jersey.' Same thing with the "creature in the sky," who gets stuck up there in a hole in the ozone layer. Man the divine manifestation effectively dies, and what remains is his degraded animal nature; the chintzy halo stuck on the primate's head is the symbol of that unhappy fall".

"Monkey Gone to Heaven" is written in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="D%20major">D major</a>, and opens with Francis' <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm guitar</a> playing a short <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> backed by the bass guitar of <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> and drums of <a href="David%20Lovering">David Lovering</a>. The guitar intensity fades as Francis begins to sing, leaving Deal's bassline and Lovering's steady drum-beat. Between each line of the verse, Francis pauses, leaving the drums and bass playing. <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago's</a> <a href="lead%20guitar">lead guitar</a> does not feature at all during the verses. By the end of the second line of each verse, the <a href="cello">cello</a> part joins in, following the bassline closely.

As the first verse finishes, the opening chord progression is repeated. This leads into the chorus (where Francis and Deal repeat "This monkey's gone to heaven") with the lead guitar of Santiago playing two notes repeatedly. The two <a href="violin">violin</a>s play a melody throughout, accompanied by a <a href="piano">piano</a> in the background. There is then a short <a href="Guitar%20solo">solo</a> by Santiago, who repeats the melody three times, to bridge the chorus and second verse. The second verse and chorus follow the same format. At the end of the second chorus, Francis shouts "Rock me Joe!"; Santiago then begins a guitar solo lasting seventeen seconds, with backing violins for the second half of the solo.

After the solo, Francis sings "If man is five" several times. There is no backing, apart from the lead guitar, for several seconds, but then the song's chord progression is heard again. This is repeated for "If the devil is six". At the end of the second chord progression, the song's main backing restarts again, with Francis screaming "Then God is seven" as the chorus approaches. The final repeated chorus of "This monkey's gone to heaven" ends the song as the string section becomes more prominent.

The band's parts were recorded at <a href="Downtown%20Recorders">Downtown Recorders</a> in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. The string section of "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was recorded while "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>" was being mixed at <a href="Carriage%20House%20Studios">Carriage House Studios</a> in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a>, the album's producer, was inspired to add a string section to the song after seeing Deal plucking the strings of a grand piano during recording. The production team, led by Norton, asked the studio owner John Montagnese to bring in string players for one evening session. The studio was often used for recording <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l scores for <a href="B-movie">B-movie</a>s such as "<a href="Missing%20in%20Action%20%28film%29">Missing in Action</a>" and "<a href="Silver%20Bullet%20%28film%29">Silver Bullet</a>". Montagnese hired four classical musicians from a local orchestra for the recording, with the session taking place on the afternoon of December 4, 1988.

Arthur Fiacco, a <a href="cello">cellist</a>, arrived at Carriage House first. He was dressed in formal black and white attire, having traveled from an afternoon concert. Fiacco was surprised to find there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The <a href="violin">violin</a>ists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.

"Monkey Gone to Heaven", the first single from "Doolittle", was released to <a href="radio%20station">radio station</a>s for rotation in April 1989 in the United States. The single reached number five on the US <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart, with the help of <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>' marketing. In the United Kingdom, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was released on April 1, 1989 and spent three weeks in the UK chart, debuting at number 60.

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, the Pixies' first, features the band playing their instruments on a stage, with the camera alternating to focus on each band member. Filmed in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a>, "searchlights" cross the stage and several camera effects are used, such as <a href="slow-motion">slow-motion</a>. The camera switches to color for a few seconds several times during the video, before reverting to black-and-white. Halfway through the video, fog appears on-stage, covering the band. The members of the string section are not seen in the video.

The song would later be re-recorded by <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a> and released on his 2004 album "<a href="Frank%20Black%20Francis">Frank Black Francis</a>".

South African band Absinthe covered the song on their album "A Rendezvous at Nirvana".

In general, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" received a positive critical reaction. British magazine "<a href="NME">NME</a>", reviewing the UK 7" single in March 1989, said: "All the smart bastards are mixing strings with grunge guitars nowadays and the Pixies are no exception. Snarled vocals, <a href="Science%20fiction">sci-fi</a> lyrics, and the usual molten lava flow of guitars burn another crater where your ears used to be. 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' pukes acid and poetry into America's <a href="album%20oriented%20rock">AOR</a> heartland before being splattered by the faster and more direct sting of the second track 'Manta Ray'." Upon the release of "Doolittle" in April 1989, "NME"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Edwin Pouncey added: "the wonderful 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' is laced with lush but unobtrusive strings which nibble round the edge of the song and push it into a new realm of arrangement for the band. The opportunity to give 'Monkey' the full Philharmonic treatment, complete with heavenly harp, must have been a temptation to them. Wisely such a folly has been resisted."

"<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>", in their review of "Doolittle", described "Monkey Gone to Heaven": "It's not pretty, but its carefully structured noise and straight forward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense: a gut feeling that is doubled when it gets within sniffing distance of a tune, as on 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' or 'Debaser'." "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s David Fricke, reviewing "Doolittle", said "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." The critical success of "Monkey Gone to Heaven" was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts. However, the song did not perform as well in the British charts, reaching a peak position of number 60 and falling off the charts after three weeks.

Fort Yellowstone

Fort Yellowstone was a <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> fort, established in 1891 at <a href="Mammoth%20Hot%20Springs">Mammoth Hot Springs</a> in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Department</a> was unable to effectively manage the park. Administration was transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> in August 1886 and General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post "Camp Sheridan" in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters, the <a href="Horace%20M.%20Albright">Horace Albright</a> Visitor Center and staff accommodations.

Between the years 1891 and 1913, a total of 60 structures were erected at Fort Yellowstone, of which 35 were still in existence one hundred years later. The fort was built in two major construction waves. During the first construction period from 1891 to 1897, mainly wood-framed buildings in what has been referred to as "cottage style" were built. A few of them had <a href="Colonial%20Revival%20architecture">Colonial Revival</a> architectural elements. A second construction wave began in 1908 and concluded in 1913. These structures were primarily built from locally quarried sandstone. Many of the structures from the later construction period are now used as administrative offices, residences for National Park Service employees, museums and visitor center. Beyond the immediate confines of the fort, cabins were constructed for use by small detachments of army personnel while on patrol throughout the park.

Besides the buildings of Fort Yellowstone, the army left a legacy of policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service as part of their resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the <a href="campaign%20hat">campaign hat</a> worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by <a href="National%20Park%20Service%20Ranger">Park Rangers</a>.

More than 40 years before the creation of the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first <a href="national%20park">national park</a>. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Department</a> and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. <a href="George%20Graham%20Vest">Senator George Vest</a> led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a>, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.

In August 1886, Lieutenant General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> sent Company M, <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st U.S. Cavalry</a> to the Park, where they established Camp Sheridan, named after General Sheridan, at <a href="Mammoth%20Hot%20Springs">Mammoth Hot Springs</a>. Camp Sheridan consisted of an arrangement of temporary facilities at the base of Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth Hot Springs <a href="travertine">travertine</a> terraces. None of the facilities that comprised Camp Sheridan remain as they were all removed over the years.

Congress appropriated funds for the establishment of a permanent fort in 1891, and the Interior Department allocated land just north of Camp Sheridan for permanent facilities. Camp Sheridan was renamed Fort Yellowstone on May 11, 1891. The army continued to use Fort Yellowstone until they turned over control of the park and the fort to the newly formed National Park Service in October 1918.

Fort Yellowstone was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on July 31, 2003. The fort, along with <a href="Concession%20%28contract%29">concessionaire</a> facilities that were built after the National Park Service assumed management of the park, comprise what is collectively known as the <a href="Mammoth%20Hot%20Springs%20Historic%20District">Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District</a>.

Fort Yellowstone was constructed between 1891 and 1913 on the eastern edge of the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, southeast of the present Mammoth Hotel, at a cost of approximately $700,000 ($16 million in 2013 dollars). By 1905, three more troops of cavalry had been added to the original Company M contingent of 50 soldiers, and during this period the fort facilities were almost continuously expanded to meet the requirements of park administration, ordinary cavalry training, and growing numbers of visitors.

The initial wave of construction between 1891–97 was representative of typical army posts of the period. Like other western military posts, the earliest buildings erected at Fort Yellowstone were constructed according to quartermaster general standardized plans. In design, they were of a generally spartan appearance with a few <a href="Colonial%20Revival%20architecture">Colonial Revival</a> style domestic elements, described by the army as "cottage style". The buildings were of one to two-and-a-half stories in height, and of frame construction with drop siding and stone foundations, with evenly spaced double-hung sash windows and prominent porches.

A second phase of building and upgrades started in 1908 which resulted in the prominent architecture visible at Fort Yellowstone in the 21st century. Built from locally quarried sandstone, these buildings defined Fort Yellowstone. The most prominent of the structures built in the later period is the <a href="Horace%20Albright%20Visitor%20Center">Horace Albright Visitor Center</a> which was originally the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1). Each historic building in the fort and the park was assigned an official number, with the original bachelor officers' quarters being building number 1. Architects <a href="Reed%20and%20Stem">Reed and Stem</a> and <a href="Robert%20Reamer">Robert Reamer</a> along with the U.S. Army Office of the Chief Quartermaster, <a href="Department%20of%20Dakota">Department of Dakota</a> participated in the design of many of the facilities. Engineer facilities and landscaping were designed by Captain <a href="Hiram%20M.%20Chittenden">Hiram M. Chittenden</a> of the U.S. Corps of Engineers.

The first building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the guardhouse (Bldg 9) at the southwest corner of the fort. In 1891, visitors traveled the lower Mammoth road through what is now the main residential area for park personnel. The guardhouse was the first building they encountered in the Mammoth area and there was always a sentry on duty to check visitors entering the park. The building is now a private residence. The original fort administration building (Bldg 8) was located immediately next to the guardhouse and is now also a private residence. Of the twelve buildings constructed in 1891, the most prominent are two of the four double officers' quarters (Bldgs 6 and 7) which front the old parade ground. Other buildings constructed in 1891 included a 60-man barracks, a commissary storehouse (Bldg 10), a quartermaster storehouse (Bldg 11), a granary (Bldg 12), a bakery (Bldg 24), a stable (Bldg 25) and the first two of four non-commissioned officers' (NCO) quarters (Bldgs 30 and 33). These NCO quarters became known as "soap-suds row' because many of the NCO wives were former army laundresses who supplemented their husbands' income by doing laundry for post personnel.
A number of significant buildings were added to the fort from 1893 to 1899 including a 10-bed hospital, quarters for hospital personnel (Bldg 14), and a large hay shed (Bldg 20) which were constructed in areas behind officers' row in 1894. Of these structures, only the hospital quarters building remains and is now used as a private residence. The most significant building constructed in 1895 was the U.S. Commissioner's office, which included a jail and residence for the U.S. Marshal (Bldg 49). The first commissioner was Judge <a href="John%20W.%20Meldrum">John W. Meldrum</a> who served the army and National Park Service until 1935 from this building. Located well west of the rest of the fort, this was the first stone building within the fort. It was a one-and-a-half-story rock-faced sandstone dwelling with <a href="Gablet%20roof">gable-on-hip</a> roof, through-the-cornice <a href="dormer">dormer</a>s and a full-width porch. The ground floor of the house contained the jail, office, and living quarters while bedrooms were situated on the second floor. The structure is used today as a private residence. The building was funded with the passage of the <a href="John%20F.%20Lacey%23The%20Lacey%20Act%20of%201894">Lacey Act of 1894</a>. Sponsored by U.S. Representative <a href="John%20F.%20Lacey">John F. Lacey</a>, the Lacey Act was ""An Act To protect the birds and animals in Yellowstone National Park, and to punish crimes in said park, and for other purposes.""

Construction during this period also included two double officers' quarters (Bldgs 4 and 5) which completed "officers' row" in 1893. Two NCO quarters (Bldgs 31 and 32) were added to "soap-suds row" in 1897 and the distinctive cavalry barracks (Bldg 27), which now houses administrative offices, was constructed in 1899.
Captain Hiram M. Chittenden was the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> senior engineer in Yellowstone from 1899–1906. The Corps had been responsible for road and other infrastructure construction within the park since 1883. In 1901, in cooperation with Captain John Pitcher, Acting Park Superintendent, he began a series of projects to improve the quality of life at the fort. Chittenden had a reservoir built in 1901 to provide a consistent supply of water for irrigation, human consumption and fire fighting. The engineers oversaw a project during 1901 which cleared, manured and seeded the area immediately in front of officers' row to create a grassy parade ground and seeded areas around the various buildings to reduce perennially dusty summer conditions. Fort Yellowstone transitioned from oil to electric lighting in 1902 after Chittenden completed a 100-kilowatt powerplant east of the fort. The powerplant and reservoir no longer exist, but most of the grassy areas around Fort Yellowstone that Chittenden planned remain.
In 1903, Captain Chittenden oversaw the design and construction of the second stone building in Yellowstone, the engineers headquarters (Bldg 39), often called the "Pagoda" because of its design. This structure is in a prominent but isolated location just north of the fort. In 1918, after the National Park Service began administration of the park, the engineer's headquarters building became the first official park headquarters.

Another prominent Yellowstone landmark, the <a href="Roosevelt%20Arch">Roosevelt Arch</a>, was constructed in 1903 under the supervision of Chittenden. A north entrance station and gate near <a href="Gardiner%2C%20Montana">Gardiner, Montana</a>, was first suggested by Captains Wilber Wilder and Oscar Brown in 1899. However it was not until 1903 that Chittenden and then-Acting Superintendent Major John Pitcher were able to gain approval for the arch. The ground breaking for the arch coincided with the two-week vacation visit of U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to the park. Roosevelt was the only U.S. President to visit Yellowstone during the army era. On his last day in the park, April 24, 1903, Roosevelt participated in the cornerstone laying ceremony and the arch was completed later that year. In 1904, Major John Pitcher recommended the construction of several new buildings to accommodate the growing contingent of soldiers. The only structure approved was the new <a href="Base%20Exchange">post exchange</a> located just south of the double cavalry barracks. This striking Colonial Revival styled structure was completed in 1905, replacing a much smaller post exchange that had been built in 1894. It now functions as the National Park Service <a href="Canteen%20%28place%29">canteen</a>.

The second wave of major construction started in 1908 when the largest structures in the fort were built, including the three-story double barracks (Bldg 36), which now houses the park superintendent's office and is used as the modern park headquarters. Another large building was the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1), constructed immediately to the west, fronting the parade ground. This iconic building anchors the northwest corner of the main fort area and houses the <a href="Horace%20Albright%20Visitor%20Center">Horace Albright Visitor Center</a>, a museum, theater and the <a href="Yellowstone%20Association">Yellowstone Association</a> gift shop. Officers' row was completed with the construction of a double captains' quarters (Bldg 2) and a field officers' quarters (Bldg 3) immediately south of the bachelor officers' quarters. Cavalry stables (Bldgs 34 and 38), a double stable guardhouse and blacksmith shop (Bldg 37) were built behind these residences. All these buildings are used by the National Park Service as administrative offices, maintenance facilities or residences.
The increasing size of the army contingent required a more up-to-date guardhouse than the original. Acting Superintendents Major Benson and Colonel Brett wanted the new guardhouse to be constructed of stone. The War Department could not justify the expense, so in 1911 the guardhouse was built from concrete.

The last building constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the chapel, located just south of the original guardhouse. Army policy did not mandate that army forts provide places of worship. However, at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher, U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator <a href="Francis%20E.%20Warren">Francis E. Warren</a>, Congress appropriated the funds for the construction of a chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913. On September 19, 1914, Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King, 1st U.S. Cavalry, were the first couple to be married in the new chapel. Reverend Pritchard, an <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopalian</a> missionary, traveled to the fort from <a href="Emigrant%2C%20Montana">Emigrant, Montana</a> to perform the ceremony.
To provide shelter for small detachments of soldiers on overnight patrols, the army constructed soldier and snowshoe cabins in remote and isolated spots and at popular tourist locations. Most of these structures no longer exist, but similar, more modern cabins are maintained by the National Park Service throughout the park.
The first soldier cabins were built in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan and all of these were later removed. Cabins were also built at the Lower Geyser Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Yellowstone">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</a>, Riverside and at <a href="Soda%20Butte%20Creek">Soda Butte</a>. As more outposts were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet (1887), Snake River (Polecat Creek), West Thumb and Riverside (1892), Mud Geyser (1895), Norris and Thumb Bay (1897), Lake (1899), Snake River (1902), Gardiner (1903), West Thumb, Syvan Pass and Soda Butte (1904), Tower (1907), Crevice Mountain (1912), Snake River (1914), and Aster Creek, Cabin Creek, Harebell, and Thorofare (1915). Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at Astringent Creek, Bartlet, Boundary Creek, Coulter Creek, Hellroaring Creek, Lewis River, Park Point, Proposition, Trappers Creek, Trout Creek and Willow Creek. While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence, four remote structures remain. They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin (Bldg 234) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations (Bldgs 111 and 231). The Norris soldier station currently houses the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20National%20Park%20Ranger">Museum of the National Park Ranger</a>. Additionally, the Bechler River barn (Bldg 232) is still in existence.

U.S. Army management of Yellowstone was so successful that by 1891 they were also managing <a href="Sequoia%20National%20Park">Sequoia</a>, <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite</a> and <a href="Kings%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Kings Canyon National Park</a>s in <a href="California">California</a> and <a href="Mackinac%20National%20Park">Mackinac National Park</a> in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy. Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to the passing of the Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.

When Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry arrived in Yellowstone, Captain Moses Harris, a <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipient, on his own authority and initiative, promulgated a set of rules that his staff enforced to protect park resources still adhered to in the 21st century:

Even though Harris and his soldiers vigilantly enforced the rules, arresting many violators, there was no legal authority for prosecution or punishment. All Harris could do was expel violators from the park.
Captain Harris, and his successor, Captain <a href="Frazier%20Boutelle">Frazier Augustus Boutelle</a>, established a network of soldier and snowshoe cabins throughout the remote portions of the park. These cabins, strategically located about apart, were used by detachments of soldiers throughout the year as they stayed watchful for wildfires, vandalism and poaching. The use of remote ranger cabins for patrolling the park is still practiced by <a href="National%20Park%20Service%20Ranger">Park Rangers</a>. Captain Young, during his first tour as Acting Superintendent in 1897, established patrol cabin policies that are essentially still followed by Park Rangers. Young required that soldiers using a patrol cabin keep a daily log of activities, including game counts, visitor counts and weather observations. These logs were used to compile a monthly report sent to the headquarters at Fort Yellowstone. Young issued the following orders to all soldiers using the snowshoe cabins.
Of the many decisions made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid <a href="Angling">angler</a> and recognized the angling potential in Yellowstone waters. In 1889 he suggested the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Fisheries">U.S. Fish Commission</a> consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams in Yellowstone.
This suggestion was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, a practice that continued until 1955 and helped create the <a href="Angling%20in%20Yellowstone%20National%20Park">angling experience</a> Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.

In 1902, the population of <a href="bison">bison</a> in the park had declined to approximately 25 individual animals. Under the leadership of Captain Pitcher, the army began a program of importing plains bison from private domestic herds in Texas and Montana. Fenced enclosures were created at Mammoth and in the <a href="Lamar%20River">Lamar Valley</a>. Areas were ploughed and planted with <a href="oats">oats</a> and <a href="Timothy-grass">timothy</a> to feed the captive bison herds as well as the expanding elk herds. The bison enclosure in the Lamar Valley became known as the <a href="Lamar%20Buffalo%20Ranch">Lamar Buffalo Ranch</a>. When the army left the park in 1918, the bison population was estimated to have increased to 400 individuals.

After serving more than six years as the Acting Superintendent, Major John Pitcher was replaced by Lieutenant General <a href="Samuel%20Baldwin%20Marks%20Young">Samuel B.M. Young</a> (U.S. Army retired) in June 1907. Young was appointed by the <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, <a href="James%20Rudolph%20Garfield">James Rudolph Garfield</a> as full superintendent of the park. Although Young was a senior officer, command of the troops at Fort Yellowstone was given to Major H. T. Allen. Young's lasting contribution to Fort Yellowstone's history was his proposal to replace the army with a force of "Civilian Guards". Young, who had served as Acting Superintendent as a Captain in 1897 recognized the dysfunctional and complicated relationships between the War Department, Corps of Engineers and Interior Department which Congress knew was adversely impacting the successful administration of the park. Young's proposal was not acted upon, but it did set the stage for a decade of change that ultimately saw the creation of the National Park Service in 1916 as well as a Park Ranger force to protect the national parks.

Although the cavalry had been successful in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and the high level of training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.

Throughout 1915–16, the Interior Department was organizing itself to deal with the growing number of national parks and ultimately, Congress created the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> on August 25, 1916. Prior to the establishment of the National Park Service, in July 1916 the War Department agreed to withdraw troops from Yellowstone as of October 1, 1916, which was the end of the park visitation season. At the same time, the War Department agreed to discharge a select number of the current volunteer cavalry contingent on September 29, 1916, so they could go to work for the National Park Service as Park Rangers.

Unfortunately, Congress failed to appropriate funds for the new National Park Service for 1917 and the ranger force was disbanded in the spring of 1917. Political pressure from the Montana Congressional delegation over the loss of economic revenue from the army presence resulted in the recall of the army and 450 soldiers from the <a href="7th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Cavalry Regiment</a> were sent back to Fort Yellowstone to protect the park. Administrative control remained with the Interior Department under the supervision of Acting Superintendent Chester Allinson Lindsley, a long time civilian employee in the park. Relations between the army, the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department continued to be contentious in 1917–1918 as disagreements over proposed construction, ownership of buildings and use of personnel persisted. In 1918, Director of the National Park Service <a href="Stephen%20Mather">Stephen Mather</a> convinced Congress and the War Department that civilian control of the National Parks under the National Park Service was the right solution. On October 31, 1918, the army left Yellowstone for the last time.

<a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> a foremost American naturalist and often called the "Father of the National Parks" once wrote: "Blessings on Uncle Sam's Soldiers. They have done the job well, and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy."

While Yellowstone was under army management, the activities, policies and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved a wide variety of problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the <a href="campaign%20hat">campaign hat</a>, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry in the last years of army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21st century.

The commanding officer of the Fort Yellowstone troop was designated as the Acting Superintendent of the park, reporting to both the army and the Interior Secretary. The following army officers served in this position at Fort Yellowstone.

Six different cavalry regiments were stationed off and on during army administration of Yellowstone.

Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec

In September 1775, early in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Colonel <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> led a force of 1,100 <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> troops on an expedition from <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a> in the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> to the gates of <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>. The expedition was part of a two-pronged <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invasion</a> of the British <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Province of Quebec</a>, and passed through the wilderness of what is now <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. The other expedition invaded Quebec from <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, led by <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>.

Unanticipated problems beset the expedition as soon as it left the last significant colonial outposts in Maine. The <a href="portage">portage</a>s up the <a href="Kennebec%20River">Kennebec River</a> proved grueling, and the boats frequently leaked, ruining <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and spoiling food supplies. More than a third of the men turned back before reaching the height of land between the Kennebec and <a href="Chaudi%C3%A8re%20River">Chaudière</a> rivers. The areas on either side of the height of land were swampy tangles of lakes and streams, and the traversal was made more difficult by bad weather and inaccurate maps. Many of the troops lacked experience handling boats in <a href="rapids">white water</a>, which led to the destruction of more boats and supplies in the descent to the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a> via the fast-flowing Chaudière.

By the time that Arnold reached the settlements above the Saint Lawrence River in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men. They had traveled about through poorly charted wilderness, twice the distance that they had expected to cover. Arnold's troops crossed the Saint Lawrence on November 13 and 14, assisted by the local French-speaking <a href="Canadien">Canadien</a>s, and attempted to put Quebec City under siege. Failing in this, they withdrew to <a href="Neuville%2C%20Quebec">Point-aux-Trembles</a> until Montgomery arrived to lead an <a href="Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">unsuccessful attack</a> on the city. Arnold was rewarded for his effort in leading the expedition with a promotion to <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>.

Arnold's route through northern Maine has been listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as the Arnold Trail to Quebec, and some geographic features in the area bear names of expedition participants.

On May 10, 1775, shortly after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> began, <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> and <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> led an expedition that <a href="Capture%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga">captured Fort Ticonderoga</a> on <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> in the British <a href="Province%20of%20New%20York">Province of New York</a>. Allen and Arnold were aware that <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a> was lightly defended; there were only about 600 regular troops in the entire province. Arnold, who had done business in the province before the war, also had intelligence that the French-speaking <a href="Canadien">Canadien</a>s would be favorably disposed toward a colonial force.

Arnold and Allen each made arguments to the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> that Quebec could and should be taken from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a>, pointing out that the British could use Quebec as a staging area for attacks down Lake Champlain and into the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> valley. Congress did not want to alarm the people of Quebec, and rejected these arguments. In July 1775, amid concerns that the British might use Quebec as a base for military movements into New York, they changed their position, and authorized an invasion of Quebec via Lake Champlain, assigning the task to Major General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a> of New York.

Arnold, who had hoped to lead the invasion, decided to pursue a different approach to Quebec. He went to <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, Massachusetts in early August 1775, and approached <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, with the idea of a second eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City. Washington approved of the idea in principle, but sent a message to General Schuyler on August 20 to ensure his support of the endeavor, since the two forces would need to coordinate their efforts.

Arnold's plan called for the expedition to sail from <a href="Newburyport%2C%20Massachusetts">Newburyport, Massachusetts</a> along the coast and then up the <a href="Kennebec%20River">Kennebec River</a> to <a href="Fort%20Western">Fort Western</a> (now <a href="Augusta%2C%20Maine">Augusta, Maine</a>). From there, they would use shallow-draft river boats called "<a href="bateaux">bateaux</a>" to continue up the Kennebec River, cross the <a href="height%20of%20land">height of land</a> to <a href="Lake%20M%C3%A9gantic">Lake Mégantic</a>, and descend the <a href="Chaudi%C3%A8re%20River">Chaudière River</a> to Quebec. Arnold expected to cover the 180 miles (290 km) from Fort Western to Quebec in 20 days, despite the fact that little was known about the route. Arnold had acquired a map (copy pictured at right) and journal made by British military engineer <a href="John%20Montresor">John Montresor</a> in 1760 and 1761, but Montresor's descriptions of the route were not very detailed, and Arnold did not know that the map contained some inaccuracies or that some details had been deliberately removed or obscured.

Washington introduced Arnold to <a href="Reuben%20Colburn">Reuben Colburn</a>, a boat builder from <a href="Gardiner%2C%20Maine">Gardinerstown</a>, Maine, who was in Cambridge at the time. Colburn offered his services, and Arnold requested detailed information about the route, including potential British naval threats, <a href="History%20of%20Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States%23American%20Revolution">Indian sentiment</a>, useful supply opportunities, and an estimate of how long it would take to construct bateaux sufficient for the contemplated force. Colburn left for Maine on August 21 to fulfill these requests. Colburn asked Samuel Goodwin, the local surveyor in Gardinerston, to provide maps for Arnold. Goodwin, who was known to have <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> sympathies, provided maps that were inaccurate in the routes, distances and other important features they described.

On September 2, Washington received a letter from General Schuyler in reply to his August 20 message. Schuyler agreed with the suggested plan, and Washington and Arnold immediately began to raise troops and place orders for supplies.

Because there had been little direct action at <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a> after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> in June, many units stationed in the American camps <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">besieging the town</a> were bored with garrison life and eager for action. Arnold selected a force of 750 men from the large number who expressed interest in the proposed expedition. Most of these were divided into two <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s: one commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Roger%20Enos">Roger Enos</a> and the other by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Christopher%20Greene">Christopher Greene</a>. The rest were placed in a third battalion under <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> that included three companies—250 men—of Continental riflemen from <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a> and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Rifle%20Regiment">Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment</a>. These frontiersmen, from the Virginia and Pennsylvania wilderness, were better suited to wilderness combat than to a siege, and had been causing trouble since arriving outside Boston. The entire force numbered about 1,100. Among the volunteers were other men who rose to later prominence during and after the war, including <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, <a href="Return%20J.%20Meigs%2C%20Sr.">Return J. Meigs</a>, <a href="Henry%20Dearborn">Henry Dearborn</a>, and <a href="John%20Joseph%20Henry">John Joseph Henry</a>.

Washington and Arnold were concerned about Indian support for (or opposition to) the effort, as well as the reception Arnold's forces might receive from the Canadians once they arrived near the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a>. On August 30, Washington wrote to General Schuyler of a meeting he held with an <a href="Abenaki">Abenaki</a> chief, "[The chief] says the Indians of Canada in general, and also the French, are greatly in our favor, and determined not to act against us." Four Abenakis accompanied the expedition as scouts and guides.

On September 2, as soon as General Schuyler's agreement with the expedition was known, Arnold wrote a letter to Nathaniel Tracy, a merchant of his acquaintance in Newburyport. He asked Tracy to acquire sufficient shipping to transport the expedition to Maine without drawing the attention of <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships patrolling the area. The sea voyage was viewed by both Arnold and Washington as the most dangerous part of the expedition, because British patrols were highly effective at interfering with colonial shipping at the time.

The expedition began its departure from Cambridge on September 11, marching to Newburyport. The first units to leave were composed largely of men from that area, to whom Arnold had given extra time so that they would be able to see their families once more before the expedition left Newburyport. The last troops marched off on September 13; Arnold rode from Cambridge to Newburyport on September 15 after making final purchases of supplies.

Headwinds and fog delayed the departure of the expedition from Newburyport until September 19. In twelve hours, they reached the mouth of the Kennebec River. They spent the next two days negotiating the island channels near its mouth and sailing up the river. Arriving in Gardinerston on the 22nd, they spent the next few days at <a href="Major%20Reuben%20Colburn%20House">Reuben Colburn's house</a>, organizing supplies and preparing the boats they would use for the rest of the expedition. Arnold inspected Colburn's hastily constructed bateaux, finding them, in a portent of troubles to come, to be "very badly built", and "smaller than the directions given". Colburn and his crew spent the next three days building additional bateaux.

Arnold's troop movements did not escape British notice. General <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a> in Boston was aware that Arnold's troops were "gone to Canada and by way of Newburyport", but he believed the target to be <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, which was at the time virtually undefended. <a href="Francis%20Legge">Francis Legge</a>, the governor of Nova Scotia declared martial law, and on October 17 sent a message to England laden with rumors about American actions that turned out to be false. Admiral <a href="Samuel%20Graves">Samuel Graves</a> eventually received intelligence about Arnold's activities, reporting on October 18 that the American troops "went up the Kennebec River, and 'tis generally believed are for Quebec".

As the troop transports arrived, Arnold dispatched some of the men in the already-constructed bateaux up the Kennebec River 10 miles (16 km) to <a href="Fort%20Western">Fort Western</a>, and the others by foot on a track leading to <a href="Fort%20Halifax%20%28Maine%29">Fort Halifax</a>, 45 miles (72 km) up the Kennebec. While waiting for the bateaux to be completed, Arnold received word from scouts Colburn had sent out to reconnoiter the proposed route. Their reports included rumors of a large <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk</a> force near the southernmost French settlements on the Chaudière River. The source of these rumors was Natanis, a <a href="Norridgewock">Norridgewock</a> Indian believed to be spying for Quebec's governor, General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>; Arnold discounted the reports.

Arnold and most of the force had reached Fort Western by September 23. The next day, Arnold sent two small parties up the Kennebec. One, under Pennsylvania Lieutenant Archibald Steele, was ordered to scout as far as Lake Mégantic to gather intelligence. The second, under Lieutenant Church, was to <a href="surveying">survey</a> the route as far as the <a href="Dead%20River%20%28Kennebec%20River%29">Dead River</a>, at a place known to the local Indians as the Great Carrying Place, so that Arnold might better estimate how far the column would need to travel each day.

The full expedition set out from Fort Western on September 25. Morgan's riflemen led the way, blazing trails when necessary. Colburn and a crew of boatwrights came in the rear, to repair bateaux as needed. Morgan's group traveled relatively lightly, as they would be working to make the trail, while the last group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Enos, carried the bulk of the supplies. The expedition arrived at its first target, Fort Halifax, a decaying relic of the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, on the second day. There was a rough track from Fort Western, so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be <a href="portage">portage</a>d around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip. Arnold, rather than traveling in a heavy bateau, traveled in a lighter <a href="canoe">canoe</a> so that he might move more rapidly among the troops along the travel route.

Arnold reached <a href="Norridgewock%2C%20Maine">Norridgewock Falls</a>, location of the last settlements on the Kennebec, on October 2. Even at this early date, problems were apparent. The bateaux were leaking, resulting in spoiled food and a continual need for repairs. The men were constantly wet, due not only to the leakage but also the frequent need to pull the heavy boats upstream. As temperatures began to drop below freezing, <a href="common%20cold">colds</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> set in, reducing the effectiveness of the force.

The portage around Norridgewock Falls, a distance of about one mile (1.6 km), was accomplished with the assistance of oxen provided by the local settlers, but it took almost a week to complete; Arnold did not depart from there until October 9. Colburn's crew devoted some of this time to making repairs on the bateaux. Most of the expedition reached the Great Carrying Place on October 11, and Arnold arrived the next day. This stretch of the trek was complicated by heavy rains, rendering the portages difficult due to extremely muddy conditions.

The Great Carrying Place was a portage of roughly 12  miles (19  km), bypassing an unnavigable section of the <a href="Dead%20River%20%28Kennebec%20River%29">Dead River</a>, the tributary of the Kennebec that the expedition was to follow. The portage included a rise in elevation of about 1,000  feet (305 m) to the high points of the carry, with three ponds along the way. Lieutenant Church, the leader of the survey team, described the route as a "bad road but capable of being made good", an assessment that turned out to be somewhat optimistic.

The vanguard of the main body, led by Daniel Morgan, met Lieutenant Steele's scouting party en route to the first pond. This party had successfully scouted the route to the height of land above the Dead River, but the men were near starvation. Their supplies had been depleted, and they were largely subsisting on a protein-rich diet of fish, moose, and duck. Most of the men continued to supplement their meager supplies with the local wildlife as the expedition continued.

Church, in his description of the route, had failed to account for the heavy rains and the boggy conditions between the first and second ponds. Rain and snow slowed the long portage, and the expedition had its first casualty when a falling tree killed one of the party. Some of the men who drank the stagnant waters along the way became violently ill, forcing Arnold to order construction of a shelter at the second pond as cover for the sick, and to send some men back to Fort Halifax for supplies that had been cached there.

The first two battalions finally reached the Dead River on October 13, and Arnold arrived three days later. At this point, Arnold wrote a number of letters informing Washington and Montgomery of his progress. Several letters intended for Montgomery were intercepted and turned over to Quebec's Lieutenant Governor <a href="Hector%20Theophilus%20de%20Cramah%C3%A9">Hector Theophilus de Cramahé</a>, giving Quebec its first notice that the expedition was on its way. Arnold also dispatched the survey team again, this time to mark the trail all the way to Lake Mégantic.

Progress up the Dead River was extremely slow. Contrary to its name, which supposedly described the speed of its currents, the river was flowing rapidly enough that the men had trouble rowing and poling against the current. The leaky boats spoiled more of the food, forcing Arnold to put everyone on half rations. Then, on October 19, the skies opened, and the river began to rise in the pouring rain. Early on October 22, the men awoke to discover that the river had risen to the level of their camp, and they had to scramble to even higher ground for safety. When the sun rose they were surrounded by water.

After spending most of that day drying out, the expedition set off on October 23. Precious time was lost when some of the men mistakenly left the Dead River and ascended one of its branches, having been fooled by the high water. Soon after, seven bateaux overturned, spoiling the remaining food stores. This accident compelled Arnold to consider turning back. He called together his nearby officers for a <a href="council%20of%20war">council of war</a>. Arnold explained that although the situation was grim, he thought that the expedition should continue. The officers agreed, and decided to pick an advance party that would proceed as rapidly as possible to French settlements on the Chaudière, and work to bring supplies back. The sick and infirm were to retreat to American settlements in Maine.

Further back on the route, Lieutenant Colonel Greene and his men were starving. They had little flour, and were consuming candle <a href="tallow">tallow</a> and shoe leather to supplement their minimal rations. On October 24, Greene attempted to catch up with Arnold, but was unable to do so because Arnold had moved too far ahead. When he returned to camp, Lieutenant Colonel Enos had arrived, and they held their own council. Enos's captains were united in wanting to turn back despite Arnold's most recent orders, which were to press ahead. In the council, Enos cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of continuing, but in a meeting with his captains after the council, announced that because they were insistent on returning, he was acceding to their decision, and would return. After giving Greene's men some of his supplies, Enos and 450 men turned back.

The impact of the inaccurate maps was felt when the expedition reached the height of land. Portions of the advance party became lost in swampy bogs (the area surrounding Spider Lake on the topographic map shown above) that were not on those maps, resulting in delays reaching <a href="Lake%20M%C3%A9gantic">Lake Mégantic</a>. Although this part of the party crossed the height of land on October 25, it was not until two days later that they reached the lake. On October 28, the advance party descended the upper Chaudière, destroying three of their bateaux when they turned over and crashed into rocks above some falls on the river. The next day they encountered several <a href="Penobscot%20people">Penobscot</a> Indians, who confirmed that they were not far from <a href="Saint-Georges%2C%20Quebec">Sartigan</a>, the southernmost French settlement on the Chaudière.

Arnold, when he reached Lake Mégantic, sent a man back to the two remaining battalions with instructions on how to navigate the swampy lands above the lake. However, the way Arnold described the route included information from the incorrect maps that he had not seen on the route. As a result, some elements of the expedition spent two days lost in swamps before the majority finally reached the falls on the upper Chaudière on October 31. Along the way, Captain <a href="Henry%20Dearborn">Henry Dearborn</a>'s dog was eaten, an event recorded in his diary: "[They ate] every part of him, not excepting his entrails; and after finishing their meal, they collected the bones and carried them to be pounded up, and to make broth for another meal."

Arnold first made contact with the local population on October 30. Sympathetic to his plight, they supplied provisions and cared for the sick; some were well paid for their aid, while others refused payment. Arnold distributed copies of a letter written by Washington asking the habitants to assist the expedition, and Arnold added promises to respect the persons, property, and religion of the locals. Jacques Parent, a Canadien from <a href="L%C3%A9vis%2C%20Quebec">Pointe-Levi</a>, notified Arnold that Lieutenant Governor Cramahé had ordered the destruction of all boats on the southern banks of the Saint Lawrence after receiving the intercepted communications.

On November 9 the expedition finally reached the Saint Lawrence at Pointe-Levi, across the river from Quebec. Arnold had about 600 of his original 1,100 men, and the journey had turned out to be 350 miles (560 km), not the 180 that Arnold and Washington had thought it would be. From John Halstead, a New Jersey-born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe-Levi, Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters. Halstead's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence. Some of Arnold's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians, and then transported them from the Chaudière to the mill site. The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13–14 after three days of bad weather, likely crossing the mile-wide river between the positions of <a href="HMS%20Hunter%20%281756%29">HMS "Hunter"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Lizard%20%281757%29">HMS "Lizard"</a>, two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing.

The city of Quebec was then defended by about 150 men of the <a href="84th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot%20%28Royal%20Highland%20Emigrants%29">Royal Highland Emigrants</a> under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Allan%20Maclean%20of%20Torloisk">Allen Maclean</a>, supported by about 500 poorly organized local <a href="militia">militia</a> and 400 <a href="Royal%20Marines">marines</a> from the two warships. When Arnold and his troops finally reached the <a href="Plains%20of%20Abraham">Plains of Abraham</a> on November 14, Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender, to no avail. The Americans, with no <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s or other <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>, and barely fit for action, faced a fortified city. After hearing rumors of a planned <a href="sortie">sortie</a> from the city, Arnold decided on November 19 to withdraw to <a href="Neuville%2C%20Quebec">Pointe-aux-Trembles</a> to wait for Montgomery, who had recently captured Montreal.

When Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles on December 3, the combined force returned to the city and began a siege, finally <a href="Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">assaulting it</a> on December 31. The battle was a devastating loss for the Americans; Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan was captured along with more than 350 men. Arnold did not learn until after the battle that he had been promoted to brigadier general for his role in leading the expedition.

The invasion ended with a retreat back to <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>, Montgomery's starting point, during the spring and summer of 1776. Arnold, who commanded the army's rear guard in the later stages of the retreat, was able to delay the British advance sufficiently to prevent them from attempting to reach the Hudson River in 1776.

Enos and his detachment arrived back in Cambridge late in November. Enos was <a href="court%20martial">court-martialed</a>, charged with "quitting his commanding officer without leave". He was acquitted, and returned to service as Lieutenant Colonel of the 16th Connecticut Regiment.

<a href="John%20Sullivan%20%28general%29">John Sullivan</a>, the court-martial President, made public a written statement in support of Enos' conduct, and other officers also issued a public circular to support Enos, including <a href="William%20Heath">William Heath</a>, <a href="John%20Stark">John Stark</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Reed%20%28jurist%29">Joseph Reed</a>, and <a href="James%20Reed%20%28soldier%29">James Reed</a>.

Enos subsequently moved to <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, where he served in the militia as Colonel, Brigadier General and Major General, including commanding troops on the Vermont side of <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> during the <a href="Saratoga%20campaign">Saratoga campaign</a> to deter <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> from foraying into Vermont.

Reuben Colburn was never paid for his work, despite promises made by Arnold and Washington; the expedition ruined him financially.

Henry Dearborn settled on the Kennebec River after the war, and represented the area in the U.S. Congress before President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> appointed him <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> in 1801. Private Simon Fobes, who kept one of the many journals of the expedition, was captured in the Battle of Quebec. He and two others escaped captivity in August 1776 and retraced the trek in the opposite direction, once again with meager resources. They benefited from better weather and equipment the expedition had abandoned along the way. Fobes reached his home near <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a> at the end of September, and eventually rejoined the army. Captain <a href="Simeon%20Thayer">Simeon Thayer</a> kept a journal which was published by the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20Historical%20Society">Rhode Island Historical Society</a> in 1867 as "The invasion of Canada in 1775". After being captured at Quebec, Thayer was exchanged on July 1, 1777 and returned to the Continental Army with the rank of major. He distinguished himself during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Mifflin">Siege of Fort Mifflin</a> in November 1777 and briefly assumed command after the post's commandant was wounded.

A number of geographic features along the route of the expedition bear names related to the expedition. East Carry Pond, Middle Carry Pond, and West Carry Pond are all on the route of the portage at the Great Carrying Place, which is in the Carrying Place of Maine. Arnold Pond is the last pond on the Dead River before crossing the height of land. <a href="Mount%20Bigelow%20%28Maine%29">Mount Bigelow</a> in Maine was named for Major <a href="Timothy%20Bigelow%20%28soldier%29">Timothy Bigelow</a>, one of Arnold's officers.

The wilderness portion of the route through Maine, roughly from Augusta to the Quebec border, was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1969 as the "Arnold Trail to Quebec". The <a href="Major%20Reuben%20Colburn%20House">Major Reuben Colburn House</a>, which served as Arnold's headquarters, is now a state historic site administered by the non-profit Arnold Expedition Historical Society, and is also listed on the National Register. Both Fort Western and Fort Halifax are <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>s, primarily for their age and their role in earlier conflicts.

A historical marker in <a href="Danvers%2C%20Massachusetts">Danvers, Massachusetts</a> commemorates Arnold's expedition, placed by the Massachusetts Society, Sons of the American Revolution. There is also a historical marker in <a href="Moscow%2C%20Maine">Moscow, Maine</a> placed in 1916 by the Kennebec chapter of the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a>, and two at Skowhegan Island in Maine placed in 1912 and 2000 by the Eunice Farnsworth Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In <a href="Eustis%2C%20Maine">Eustis, Maine</a>, on the western shore of <a href="Flagstaff%20Lake%20%28Maine%29">Flagstaff Lake</a>, stands a marker commemorating the expedition. The lake was created in the 20th century by damming the Dead River, inundating part of the expedition route. Mount Bigelow, whose first recorded ascent was by Timothy Bigelow, stands just south of the lake.

In the fall of 1975, there was a reenactment of this expedition as part of the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a> celebrations.

HMS Erin

HMS "Erin was a <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, originally ordered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> government from the British <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> Company. The ship was to have been named Reşadiye" when she entered service with the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a>. The was designed to be at least the equal of any other ship afloat or under construction. When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began in August 1914, "Reşadiye" was nearly complete and was seized at the orders of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> to keep her in British hands and prevent her from being used by Germany or German allies. There is no evidence that the seizure played any part in the Ottoman government declaring war on Britain and the <a href="Entente%20Cordiale">Entente Cordiale</a>.

Aside from a minor role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in May 1916 and the inconclusive <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August</a> the same year, "Erin"s service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war; she was reduced to <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> and used as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>. "Erin" served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the reserve fleet at the <a href="Nore">Nore</a> for most of 1920. She was sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in 1922 and broken up the following year.

The design was based on the , but employed the <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> of the . "Erin" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. In 1914 her crew numbered 976 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a> and 1,064 a year later.

"Erin" was powered by a pair of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> sets, each driving two shafts, using steam from 15 <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. The turbines, rated at , were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . The ship carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> for a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . This radius of action was somewhat less than that of contemporary British battleships, but was adequate for operations in the North Sea.

The ship was armed with a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of ten <a href="BL%2013.5-inch%20Mk%20VI%20naval%20gun">BL MK VI guns</a> mounted in five twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. They were arranged in two <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> pairs, one forward and one aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>; the fifth turret was <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, between the <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> and the rear superstructure. Close-range defence against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s was provided by a secondary battery of sixteen <a href="BL%206%20inch%20naval%20guns%20Mk%20XIII%20-%20XVIII%236-inch%20Mark%20XVI%20gun%20in%20Royal%20Navy%20service">BL 6-inch Mk XVI guns</a>. The ship was also fitted with six <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%206-pounder%20Hotchkiss">6-pounder (57 mm)</a> <a href="Hotchkiss%20gun">Hotchkiss gun</a>s. As was typical for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with four submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. "Erin" was protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armoured%20belt">armoured belt</a> that was thick over the ship's vitals. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decks</a> ranged in thickness from . The main gun turrets were thick and were supported by <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s thick.

Four of the six-pounder guns were removed in 1915–1916 and a <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">QF three-inch 20-cwt</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) gun</a> was installed on the former searchlight platform on the aft superstructure. A <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a> was installed on the <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod mast</a> between May and December 1916. A pair of directors for the secondary armament were fitted to the legs of the tripod mast in 1916–1917 and another three-inch AA gun was added on the aft superstructure. In 1918, a high-angle <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> was fitted and <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off platforms</a> were installed on the roofs of 'B' and 'Q' turrets.

"Erin" originally was ordered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> on 8 June 1911, at an estimated cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>2,500,000, with the name of "Reşad V" in honour of <a href="Mehmed%20V">Mehmed V</a> Reşâd, the ruling <a href="List%20of%20sultans%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Sultan</a>, but was renamed "Reşadiye" during construction. She was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> at the <a href="Vickers%2C%20Sons%20%26amp%3B%20Maxim%2C%20Ltd">Vickers</a> shipyard in <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a> on 6 December 1911 with <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 425, but construction was suspended in late 1912 during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a> and resumed in May 1913. The ship was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 3 September and completed in August 1914. After the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> on 28 June, the British postponed delivery of "Reşadiye" on 21 July, despite the completion of payments and the arrival of the Ottoman delegation to collect "Reşadiye" and another dreadnought battleship, "<a href="HMS%20Agincourt%20%281913%29">Sultan Osman I</a>", after their <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s. The <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> ordered the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to detain the ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors formally seized them and "Reşadiye" was renamed "Erin", a poetical name for Ireland. He did this on his own initiative to augment the Royal Navy's margin of superiority over the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> and to prevent them from being acquired by Germany or its allies.

The takeover caused considerable ill will in the Ottoman Empire, where public subscriptions had partially funded the ships. When the Ottoman government had been in a financial deadlock over the budget of the battleships, donations for the Ottoman Navy had come in from taverns, cafés, schools and markets, and large donations were rewarded with a "Navy Donation Medal". The seizure, and the gift of the German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> to the Ottomans, influenced public opinion in the Empire to turn away from Britain. Historian <a href="David%20Fromkin">David Fromkin</a> has speculated that the Turks promised to transfer "Sultan Osman I" to the Germans in exchange for signing a secret defensive alliance on 1 August. Despite the alliance, the Ottoman government was intent on remaining neutral until Russian disasters during the <a href="Russian%20invasion%20of%20East%20Prussia%20%281914%29">invasion of East Prussia</a> in September persuaded <a href="Enver%20Pasha">Enver Pasha</a> and <a href="Djemal%20Pasha">Djemal Pasha</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20Government%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">Ministers of War and of the Marine</a>, respectively, that the time was ripe to exploit Russian weakness. Unbeknownst to any of the other members of the government, Enver and Djemal authorized <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Souchon">Wilhelm Souchon</a>, the German <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the Ottoman Navy, to attack Russian ships in the Black Sea in late October under the pretext of defending its warships from Russian attacks. Souchon, frustrated with Ottoman neutrality, took matters into his own hands and <a href="Black%20Sea%20Raid">bombarded Russian ports</a> in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> on 29 October as unambiguous evidence of an Ottoman attack and forced the government's hand into joining the war on Germany's side.

<a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Victor%20Stanley%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Victor Stanley</a> was appointed as "Erin"s <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>. On 5 September, she joined the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, commanded by <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a>, at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> in <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and was assigned to the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fourth Battle Squadron</a> (BS). "Erin" sailed with the ships of the Grand Fleet as they departed from <a href="Loch%20Ewe">Loch Ewe</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> on 17 September, for gunnery practice west of the Orkney Islands the following day. After the exercise, they began a fruitless search for German ships in the North Sea that was hampered by bad weather. The Grand Fleet arrived at Scapa Flow on 24 September to refuel before departing the next day for more target practice west of Orkney. In early October the Grand Fleet <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d into the North Sea to provide distant cover for a large <a href="convoy">convoy</a> transporting Canadian troops from <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a> and returned to Scapa on 12 October. Reports of <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and on 16 October, he ordered that the bulk of the Grand Fleet be dispersed to <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Jellicoe took the Grand Fleet to sea on 3 November for gunnery training and battle exercises and the 4th BS returned to Scapa six days later. On the evening of 22 November, the Grand Fleet conducted another abortive sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; "Erin" stood with the main body in support of <a href="Vice-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>'s <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a>. The fleet was back at Scapa Flow by 27 November. On 16 December, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> but failed to intercept the High Seas Fleet. "Erin" and the rest of the Grand Fleet made another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.

Jellicoe's ships, including "Erin", practised gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of the Orkney and Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's battlecruisers but the fleet was too far away to participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the following day. On 7–10 March, the fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20–21 April.
The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of the Shetlands and more training off the Shetlands from 11 July. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted training exercises and then made another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. "Erin" participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. The ship was transferred to the <a href="2nd%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Battle Squadron</a> sometime between September and December.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> to sweep the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a> but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea and the operation was confined to the northern end. Another sweep began on 6 March but was abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> escorts. On the night of 25 March, "Erin" and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> base at <a href="Tondern">Tondern</a>. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong <a href="gale">gale</a> threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> to distract the Germans while the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> re-laid its defensive <a href="naval%20mine">minefields</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before sailing south, over intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">raid on Lowestoft</a>. The Germans had withdrawn before the fleet arrived. On 2–4 May, the Grand Fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention on the North Sea.

To lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet (Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>) composed of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a> and supporting ships, departed the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a> early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s five battlecruisers. <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> had <a href="Signals%20intelligence">intercepted and decrypted</a> German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, with 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before, to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, Beatty's battlecruisers managed to bait Scheer and Hipper into a pursuit as they fell back upon the main body of the Grand Fleet. After Jellicoe deployed his ships into <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, "Erin" was the fourth from the head of the line. Scheer's manoeuvres after spotting the Grand Fleet were generally away from Jellicoe's leading ships and the poor visibility hindered their ability to close with the Germans before Scheer could disengage under the cover of darkness. Opportunities to shoot during the battle were rare, and she only fired 6 six-inch shells from her secondary armament. "Erin" was the only British battleship not to fire her main guns.

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea but miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or that it could be forced into an engagement at a disadvantage. When Stanley was promoted to <a href="Rear-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">rear-admiral</a> on 26 April 1917, he was replaced by Captain <a href="Walter%20Ellerton">Walter Ellerton</a>.
In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet sortied against British convoys to Norway. Wireless silence was enforced, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence and inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>, Scotland, when the surrendered High Seas Fleet arrived on 21 November and she remained part of the 2nd BS through 1 March 1919.

Captain <a href="Herbert%20Richmond">Herbert Richmond</a> assumed command on 1 January 1919. By 1 May, "Erin" had been assigned to the <a href="3rd%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>. In October, she was placed in reserve at the <a href="Nore">Nore</a> but was stationed at <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland Harbour</a> as of 18 November. Richmond was relieved by Captain <a href="Percival%20Hall-Thompson">Percival Hall-Thompson</a> on 1 December. "Erin" had returned to the Nore by January 1920 and became a gunnery training ship there by February. By June, the ship had become <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of Rear-Admiral <a href="Vivian%20Bernard">Vivian Bernard</a>, Rear-Admiral, Reserve Fleet, Nore. In July and August 1920, she underwent a refit at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Dockyard</a>. Through 18 December 1920, "Erin" remained Bernard's flagship and continued to serve as a gunnery training ship. The Royal Navy had originally intended that she should be retained as a training ship under the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922, but a change of plan meant that this role was filled by , so the ship was listed for disposal in May 1922. "Erin" was sold to the ship-breaking firm of <a href="Ernest%20Cox">Cox and Danks</a> on 19 December and broken up at <a href="Queenborough">Queenborough</a> the following year.

Don Tallon

Donald "Don" Tallon (17 February 1916 – 7 September 1984) was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 21 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> as a <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> between 1946 and 1953. He was widely regarded by his contemporaries as Australia's finest ever wicket-keeper and one of the best in Test history, with an understated style, an ability to anticipate the <a href="flight%20%28cricket%29">flight</a>, <a href="line%20and%20length">length</a> and <a href="spin%20bowling">spin</a> of the ball and an efficient <a href="Stumped">stumping</a> technique. Tallon toured England as part of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>'s "<a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28cricket%29">Invincibles</a>" of 1948 and was recognised as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1949 for his performances during that season. During his Test career, Tallon made 58 <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissal</a>s comprising 50 <a href="caught%20%28cricket%29">catches</a> and 8 stumpings.

His early cricket was played in <a href="Bundaberg%2C%20Queensland">Bundaberg</a> where he was selected to represent Queensland Country against the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> during the infamous "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>" tour. Aged 17, he made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> debut for <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> in December 1933. By the 1935–36 season, Tallon was an established player and he topped the Queensland <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s for the season, however he was a surprise non-inclusion for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938 Australian team</a> to tour England. Following the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and the retirement or unavailability of other candidates, he was finally given an opportunity to play Test cricket, making his debut against <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> in 1946 aged 30.

Following the "Invincibles" tour, poor health dogged Tallon, causing him to miss the 1949–50 tour of <a href="South%20African%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. He recovered his spot for the Ashes series in 1950–51, catching well but failing with the <a href="batting%20%28cricket%29">bat</a>. Tallon missed selection for the 1951–52 Test season but recovered his spot for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201953">1953 Australian team</a> to tour England. He played in the first Test before being replaced by <a href="Gil%20Langley">Gil Langley</a>, this time permanently. He retired from first-class cricket in 1953 and returned to Bundaberg, assisting his brother in running a <a href="Milk%20bar">corner store</a>. He died in Bundaberg aged 68.

Tallon was born and raised in the Queensland coastal sugar and rum town of <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a>, north of <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. He learned to play cricket on a <a href="cricket%20pitch">backyard wicket</a> with his three brothers and father Les, an <a href="iron%20moulder">iron moulder</a> at the Bundaberg <a href="foundry">foundry</a>, who played as a <a href="Spin%20bowling">slow bowler</a> in the local cricket competition. Often the matches would stretch past the daylight hours, and the brothers would play inside the house after moving the furniture to create some open space. Tallon was formally trained as a wicket-keeper at North Bundaberg State School where he and his brothers were coached by <a href="Tom%20O%27Shea">Tom O'Shea</a>, a teacher and former <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> wicket-keeper. He became the primary school's wicket-keeper at the age of seven, playing with and against boys aged 11 and 12. He learned to keep to the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of his brother <a href="Bill%20Tallon">Bill</a>, who also went on to represent Queensland. Tallon later said of his decision to become a wicket-keeper, "You are never out of the game, and that suits me fine". He was captain of his school team at the age of 11 and rose to become captain of Queensland Schoolboys aged 13. He played in Bundaberg's <a href="division%20%28sport%29">A grade</a> adult team at 14, and came to the attention of state selectors when Bundaberg played a team captained by Test player <a href="Alan%20Kippax">Alan Kippax</a> in 1931.

The following season, he played in the Country trials in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. He was selected for the Queensland <a href="youth%20system">Colts</a> in 1932–33 and represented Queensland Country against <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>'s <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> during the <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> tour. In England's innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five <a href="bye%20%28cricket%29">byes</a> and stumped <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>, regarded as one of the finest batsmen in Test history. He did not get a chance to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat, before <a href="bowled">bowling</a> him for two. Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express <a href="fast%20bowling">pace bowling</a> of <a href="Eddie%20Gilbert%20%28cricketer%29">Eddie Gilbert</a>, whose <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">suspect action</a> and <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous</a> heritage were later the subject of controversy.

He made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for Queensland at 17 against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes and took a catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled that it was not advisable to take such a young player on away trips to <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in only one other first-class match for the 1933–34 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>.

In his second first-class match in the 1934–35 season, and his fourth overall, he confirmed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australian</a> bowling attack led by <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a>, the world's leading <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner at the time, but was unable to prevent an eight-wicket defeat. Tallon played in five matches for the season, and Queensland lost four and won none. He took four catches, made two stumpings and scored 216 runs at 24.00 in innings, although he did score four ducks.

Towards the end of 1934, Tallon moved to Brisbane, where he worked as a storeman for a car company. In 1935–36, Tallon was Queensland's top batsman in terms of both runs and <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, scoring 569 runs at an average of 51.72. He started well with 58 in a drawn match against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>, and then scored 45 and made six dismissals in an innings as Queensland fell to an innings defeat against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC), including five stumpings. He then made four dismissals in an innings in the next match against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>.

Tallon was prominent in the next match against South Australia in <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide</a>. The hosts included Australia captain <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> in their ranks, making a comeback from illness. The match was mainly noted for Bradman's 233 but Tallon impressed him by taking two particularly difficult catches, one of which dismissed the Australian captain himself. Bradman also praised Tallon for conceding only seven byes in a total of 642, particularly his ability to <a href="caught">take</a> balls passing down the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>. Tallon then scored 88 in Queensland's reply. Bradman opined that he had a "clean-hitting crisp style ... attacking, positive, and with a technique to rival most first-class batsmen". Despite this, Queensland fell to defeat by an innings and 226 runs. He followed this with 51 in a defeat to New South Wales. The highlight of Tallon's season was his highest first-class score of 193, against Victoria in Brisbane, in the last fixture of the season, a match in which he also took five catches in an <a href="innings">innings</a>. Tallon's innings played a large part in the hosts' saving of the match after conceding a lead of 252 on the first innings. As he continued his consistent form with both bat and gloves, he came into strong consideration for Test selection. While Tallon was performing strongly in Australia, the national team were in South Africa and defeated their hosts 4–0. Nevertheless, it was another unsuccessful season for Queensland; Tallon did not experience a win and suffered losses in three of his six matches.

During the 1930s, Queensland was a weak cricketing state, having only been admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926–27, and the <a href="Australian%20Board%20of%20Control">national</a> selectors tended to choose Australia teams composed entirely of New South Welshmen, Victorians and South Australians. New South Wales' <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a> was the incumbent wicket-keeper and had no plans to retire, while Victoria's <a href="Ben%20Barnett">Ben Barnett</a> had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England. South Australia's <a href="Charlie%20Walker%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201909%29">Charlie Walker</a> was also talked of as a possible Test player.

Tallon was scrutinised as a Test candidate when England toured for the 1936–37 Ashes series. He was selected in Bradman's XI for a one-off match against <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Victor Richardson</a>'s XI at the start of the season. It was a testimonial for Richardson and such matches were used as Test trials for the top players in Australia. Tallon took three catches but was unable to capitalise with the bat. He made three and was unbeaten without scoring in the second innings as Bradman's men reached their target. In the next match against New South Wales, Tallon took four catches and scored 100 to bring his team back into contention after conceding a 190-run lead. However, New South Wales scraped home to win by one wicket. It continued a winless streak for Tallon in Queensland colours that had lasted for over two and a half years. Tallon had a final chance to push for selection in two matches for an Australian XI and Queensland respectively, against <a href="Gubby%20Allen">Gubby Allen</a>'s Englishmen before the Tests. He made a total of seven dismissals but scored only 49 runs in three innings.

When the Test team was announced, Tallon was overlooked as the selectors persisted with Oldfield. Tallon remained consistent for Queensland, making 22 dismissals in total for the season. With the bat, he once again topped his state's averages, scoring 434 runs at 36.16. He scored 101 against South Australia and 96 against Victoria, but both matches were lost. Queensland defeat New South Wales to record their first win in three years, but the remaining five Sheffield Shield matches were all lost.

The 1937–38 season was purely domestic, with no international matches, but it was an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the <a href="australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938 Ashes tour</a>. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.

Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party surprised commentators. In selection deliberations, Bradman had lobbied for Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, <a href="Chappie%20Dwyer">Chappie Dwyer</a> from New South Wales and <a href="William%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201884%29">Bill Johnson</a> from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, because of his previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, regarded alongside <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection. A leak revealed that the reason for his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a>: O'Reilly, <a href="Chuck%20Fleetwood-Smith">Chuck Fleetwood-Smith</a> and <a href="Frank%20Ward%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201906%29">Frank Ward</a>. Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to <a href="fast%20bowling">medium pacers</a>. In reality, Tallon stood back and stood up to the stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were <a href="swing%20bowling">swinging</a> the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">edge</a>. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.

During the series, Barnett made two notable errors. With Australia leading the series 1–0 going into the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, Barnett dropped <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Leyland">Maurice Leyland</a> when both were on 40. Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461 runs as they set a world record score of 7/903. Bradman injured himself during the marathon innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen%20or%20openers">opener</a> <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> also injured, Australia were down to nine men and fell to the heaviest defeat in Test history (an innings and 579 runs) and the series was drawn.

Tallon responded during the 1938–39 season by equalling two world records. The season started poorly for Queensland, not winning any of their first three matches. Tallon made eight dismissals in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield campaign against New South Wales, but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand. After two consecutive losses, Tallon set the first of his world records. Against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> in Sydney, he dismissed 12 batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>'s <a href="Ted%20Pooley">Ted Pooley</a>. Tallon's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years. After nine innings during the season without passing 36, Tallon returned to form with the bat, scoring 115 against South Australia, but was unable to take the field in the second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten-wicket defeat. In the final match of the season, Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings, in a match against Victoria. He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348, and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win. Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches, setting a new Australian season record. He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more animated, and his <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a>ing reached new levels of sound. He passed 100 first-class dismissals during the season, achieved in just 32 matches—the fastest Australian to reach the mark. Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30.50.

Following his form in 1938–39, Tallon eagerly awaited the arrival of England for the 1940–41 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and regarded as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves. However, the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29. In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 1939–40. It was another poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches. Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket. Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales at the end of the season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.

With the war intensifying, the 1940–41 season was truncated and the last before the hostilities ended. Tallon scored 55 and completed four dismissals as Queensland started with a 27-run loss to New South Wales. He then starred in a match for combined Queensland and Victoria team against New South Wales. Tallon scored 55 and 152 and completed four dismissals, but was unable to prevent a one-wicket loss. He ended with 379 runs at 42.11 and made 16 dismissals in five matches.

With first-class cricket cancelled, Tallon joined the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Army</a> in August 1940 at Bundaberg. Tallon was discharged in 1943 as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> and was not decorated. His discharge was due to <a href="stomach%20ulcer">stomach ulcer</a>s and he later had a major operation to remove part of his stomach.

Upon the resumption of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at <a href="Changi%20Prison">Changi</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his way back into the Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a gunner and was killed in a duel with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> fighter pilots over <a href="Soltau">Soltau</a> in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like <a href="Gil%20Langley">Gil Langley</a> or <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a> with an eye to the future. With the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after the resumption of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a>, a future Test teammate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.

Tallon made his Test debut in a one-off Test against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> at <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> in March 1946, although the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a <a href="sticky%20wicket">wet wicket</a>, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the <a href="spin%20bowling">slow bowling</a> of <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>. Tallon made a stumping, a <a href="run%20out">run out</a> and took a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During the tour of New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.

The following season saw Australia's first Test series since the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, with five matches scheduled against <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a>'s touring <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201946-47">Englishmen</a> in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series">1946-47 Ashes series</a>. Tallon staked his claim for the Test wicket-keeping position in Queensland's second match of the season, which was against <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201946%E2%80%9347%23Queensland%20vs%20MCC">MCC</a>. Tallon combined with McCool in four stumpings and two catches, and in the process took his first-class tally to 170 dismissals his 50th first-class match. He also scored 26 and 35. Tallon's proficiency keeping wicket to McCool's bowling was now a major factor in his favour for national selection, because McCool had established himself as Australia's first-choice spinner since the retirement of O'Reilly. Tallon was duly selected for the First Test of the series in Brisbane.

In <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23First%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Brisbane">First Test at Brisbane</a> Tallon took two catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon was worried that his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but he was retained as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney. He put in a polished performance with the gloves, with four catches and two stumpings, in addition to 30 runs. The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger. Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match. <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>—two of England's leading batsmen—had seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket. Tallon declared to Bradman that he intended to dismiss Hutton down the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>, so Bradman brought <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> into the attack immediately after lunch. Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">glance</a> the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a>. He turned around and was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre. The score was 2/88 as Hutton, who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a> which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slip</a>, in the chest. The ball rebounded past Tallon's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed. According to <a href="Roland%20Perry">Roland Perry</a>, it was "an acrobatic feat that would put any <a href="trapeze">trapeze</a> artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history". Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4/99, with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match-winning lead.

Tallon now felt secure about his place in the team for the rest of the series. This led to increased confidence in his play in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Third%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Melbourne">Third Test at Melbourne</a> (MCG). After keeping tidily and scoring 35 in the first innings, Tallon combined with <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> in the second innings for a 154-run <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> in just 92 minutes. Described by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" as a "hurricane", the partnership was marked by Tallon's powerful <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driving</a> and <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cutting</a>. Lindwall reached his century, but Tallon fell for 92 to <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a>. Tallon's 92 remained the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until <a href="Rod%20Marsh">Rod Marsh</a> equalled it with 92 not out in the <a href="1970-71%20Ashes%20series">1970-71 Ashes series</a> and surpassed it with 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74.

In the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Fourth%20Test%20-%20Adeliade">Fourth Test at Adelaide</a> Tallon stumped <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, but the umpire gave him not out because "the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease" and Compton made 147. The England openers <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon caught Washbrook, scooping up a ball from Lindwall. Washbrook "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" - and this caused an <a href="Umpiring%20in%20the%201946%E2%80%9347%20Ashes%20series%23Catches%20and%20Stumpings">umpiring controversy</a>. But Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. Washbrook told <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon's gloves and the England captain tried unsuccessfully to find a press photograph of the ball touching the ground. Later in the match Tallon missed a vital stumping off the England wicketkeeper <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, who stayed put for 95 minutes without making a run. Tallon stumped Compton again, but he was given not out and went on to make an unbeaten 103 in a match-saving stand of 85 with Evans.

Tallon's keeping was further lauded in the second innings of the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Fifth%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Sydney">Fifth Test</a>, when he stumped Edrich, <a href="Jack%20Ikin">Jack Ikin</a> and <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> from McCool's bowling. By series end, Tallon had set an Australian Test record of 20 dismissals in a series and averaged 29 with the bat. He also scored 54 and claimed seven dismissals in a Queensland win over South Australia.

Tallon started the next season by taking five catches and scoring 41 in the second innings and Queensland scraped home to beat New South Wales by two wickets. He played in all five Tests against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in the Australian summer of 1947–48, and earned praise from Indian skipper <a href="Lala%20Amarnath">Lala Amarnath</a> who described him as the "greatest keeper he had seen". Tallon made 13 dismissals but had an unproductive time with the bat, scoring only 49 runs at 12.25. Outside the Tests, Tallon scored 229 runs at 22.90 and made 15 dismissals in six matches for Queensland.

Tallon's form saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the "<a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Invincibles</a>". Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. As England agreed to make a <a href="cricket%20ball%23Condition%20of%20a%20cricket%20ball">new ball</a> available every 55 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>, this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would <a href="Swing%20bowling">swing</a> more. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stump</a>s to his Queensland teammate.

Early in the tour, Tallon struck an unbeaten 17 on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">damp pitch</a> in a low-scoring match as Australia defeated <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> by four wickets. It was the closest that the tourists came to defeat for the tour.

Tallon had difficulty with the English conditions early in the season as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> on a misty morning during a tour match against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. As a result of the injury, Tallon was rested for the following three matches.

Despite sustaining an injury from a catching error, Tallon was selected for the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. He took four catches, including two difficult ones to dismiss key batsmen at the start of the second innings. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, which was converted into an eight-wicket victory. The teams moved on to <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings. Tallon made 53 and helped the <a href="tail%20%28cricket%29">tail</a> to "wag" and recover from a position of 7/258. Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40 runs. One of the three catches he took stood out; it came when Washbrook <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">inside edged</a> a Toshack <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a> directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as "miraculous" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Another dive to stop a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">leg glance</a> resulted in a severely bruised left little finger. However, Tallon also conceded 16 byes in England's total of 186. Australia won the Test, and Tallon was rested ahead of the next Test to allow his finger to recover.

The teams played out a draw in the third match at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Manchester</a>, where Tallon dismissed <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a> from the bowling of <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> with a diving one-handed catch. He also dropped Compton three times, allowing the English batsman to go from 50 to 145 not out as he held the hosts' first innings together.

Tallon's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, ruling him out of the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a>, which Australia won to secure the series. He returned for the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, taking three catches, including an acrobatic catch of <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> down the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> that was considered the catch of the season. He scored 31 as Australia sealed the series 4–0 with an innings win. When the last match of the tour against <a href="Scotland%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a> in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match.

Tallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series, aggregating 114 runs at 28.50. In 14 first-class matches, he scored 283 runs at 25.72. The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on pace bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests; however, Bradman rested his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall during the tour games to save energy for the Tests and allowed the spinners do more work, so that overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the tour. Bradman deemed Tallon more agile than Saggers and better at taking acrobatic catches. Tallon's performances during the English summer saw him named by "Wisden" as one of its five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>.

Upon Tallon's return to Australia, he made an unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948. He featured in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with <a href="Geff%20Noblet">Geff Noblet</a>, who scored only nine as Tallon <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">farmed the strike</a> effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match. Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match. Queensland lost more than they won during the season, but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.

Tallon was selected for but withdrew from the 1949–50 tour to South Africa due to illness caused by <a href="stomach%20ulcer">stomach ulcer</a>s, and employment reasons. His place was taken by Saggers, who made 21 dismissals in the five Tests. In the meantime, Tallon recovered and played in the Australian domestic season. After scoring 52 in the opening match for the season, he scored 98 and two scores of 58 not out to help Queensland end the season with consecutive wins. He ended with 349 runs at 43.63 and 11 dismissals in six matches. Tallon was selected for a brief tour of New Zealand at the end of the season with an Australian Second XI led by <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, and scored 116 in an unofficial Test in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>. It was the top-score in Australia's 299 and the hosts led by only eight runs with one wicket in hand in their second innings when the match ended in a draw. Many of the matches during the tour were not first-class but in one such game, Tallon scored 70 not out as Australia defeated <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a> by an innings.

For the <a href="1950-51%20Ashes%20series">home Ashes series of 1950–51</a> Tallon was fit once more and available for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39 runs at an average of just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.

By this time, Tallon was losing his hearing, and gained the derisive nickname "Deafy". In one Test, he had been told by captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> before going out to bat that there was to be an appeal for <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">bad light</a>. Hassett said "go for the light" but Tallon misheard it as "go for a lash". Tallon walked out and was dismissed for a low score after attempting to attack the English bowlers, leaving his skipper displeased.

Tallon missed selection during the 1951–52 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and a combination of health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness. He did not play a first-class match because of lack of his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised comments in the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.

He was unable to reclaim his Test place in 1952–53 despite making 133 against the touring <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team">South Africans</a> and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests. Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 dismissals in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match. His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane, making fun of the mistakes made by Tallon's replacement <a href="Gil%20Langley">Gil Langley</a> in particular.

He was selected for the 1953 tour of England, and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed. Despite making only 35 runs at 7.00 in the lead-up matches, Tallon was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, his first match at the top level in more than two years. He took two catches and scored a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> and 15. Hassett and his deputy <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> then made the decision to replace Tallon with Langley. Still troubled by stomach ulcers, Tallon played in another eight first-class matches for the tour, scoring 119 runs at 19.83. His most notable effort was an unbeaten 83 in an innings win over <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>. He was unable to regain his Test position.

Tallon retired in dramatic circumstances after the first match of the 1953–54 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off his gloves and handed the keeping duties to <a href="Peter%20Burge%20%28cricketer%29">Peter Burge</a>. He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>'s XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.

Regarded as one of Australia's finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was lean and relatively tall for a wicket-keeper, standing 180 cm. Tallon's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style, rather than raw statistics. In 21 Tests, Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings, making 58 dismissals at an average of 1.41 per innings. Modern Australian glovemen such as <a href="Rod%20Marsh">Rod Marsh</a> and <a href="Ian%20Healy">Ian Healy</a>, both of whom held the Test world record for dismissals, averaged closer to two. Tallon's Test batting average of 17.13 pales in comparison to that of contemporary wicket-keepers such as Australia's <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka's</a> <a href="Kumar%20Sangakkara">Kumar Sangakkara</a>, both of whom have made a double century and more than ten centuries. English wicket-keepers from two decades after World War II such as <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> and <a href="Jim%20Parks%20junior">Jim Parks</a> scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon.

Tallon had an understated style, which was without flourish or flamboyancy. He was known for his anticipation of the <a href="Flight%20%28cricket%29">flight</a>, <a href="Line%20and%20length">length</a> and <a href="Spin%20bowling">spin</a> of the ball. He was particularly regarded for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side. Tallon often stood up to the stumps for medium pace bowlers and he had a textbook stumping technique in which he lifted the <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a> without disturbing the <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stumps</a>. Tallon's crouch was more pronounced than most other keepers and he rebounded upwards further and faster than others. He had a particularly smooth and graceful catching technique that left his hands undamaged from the ball's impact, the injury in England in 1948 being a notable exception that proved the rule. In recognising him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year in the 1949 "Wisden", the Almanack noted that his hands resembled those of a <a href="violin">violin</a>ist, while Bradman noted that all his "fine, longer fingers were intact" as though he had not played much cricket. According to his English counterpart <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, Tallon was the "best and most nimble keeper ever" while Australian teammate <a href="Alan%20Keith%20Davidson">Alan Davidson</a> called him the "Bradman of keepers". Due to financial reasons, Tallon could not afford new equipment and he used an outdated pair of <a href="gauntlet%20%28glove%29">iron-coated gloves</a> for most of his career.

Strong driving and quick scoring were hallmarks of his batting, made possible by his swift footwork. According to Bradman, Tallon's batting was "attacking, positive and with a technique to rival most first-class batsmen". This led Bradman to select Tallon in his all-time best XI. Tallon was a vociferous and frequent <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appealer</a> behind the stumps, something that led to complaints from opposition batsmen who felt that the pressure he exerted was unfair.

Tallon married his first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946. The constant travel, interstate and overseas, took a toll on his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950. In 1954, he married Lynda Kirchner from his native Bundaberg, with whom he had two daughters. In retirement, Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg. His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 1967–68. The Tallon bridge, built in 1995 in Bundaberg was named after the famous Bundabergian which links west & north Bundaberg. He died of <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a> in 1984.

Scott Zolak

Scott David Zolak (born December 13, 1967) is a broadcaster and retired <a href="American%20football">American football</a> <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> who played in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) for nine seasons. Over the course of his career, he played in 55 games for the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> and <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, completed 124 of 248 passes for 1,314 yards, threw eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, and finished his career with a passer rating of 64.8.

A graduate of <a href="Ringgold%20High%20School%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Ringgold High School</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a>, Zolak was selected 84th in the <a href="1991%20NFL%20Draft">1991</a> <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a> by the New England Patriots. He did not play in 1991, but started four games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When <a href="Drew%20Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a> was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup for the next six seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released at the end of the 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.

Zolak was born on December 13, 1967 in <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. As a child, he acted as the <a href="waterboy">waterboy</a> for the football team at <a href="Ringgold%20High%20School%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Ringgold High School</a> in <a href="Monongahela%2C%20Pennsylvania">Monongahela, Pennsylvania</a>, where his father, Paul, worked as head coach and <a href="athletic%20director">athletic director</a>. Future NFL quarterback <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a> played for Ringgold during this time and gave Zolak a football, which he later rubbed for good luck before every game. When Zolak attended Ringgold High School himself, he was the team's <a href="starting%20lineup">starting</a> quarterback and <a href="punter%20%28American%20football%29">punter</a>, and <a href="Letterman%20%28sports%29">lettered</a> four times. Zolak also played on the Ringgold basketball team as a <a href="forward%20%28basketball%29">forward</a>, and was a four-time letterman in that sport as well. As a result of his football performance, he was invited to participate in the <a href="Big%2033%20Football%20Classic">Big 33 Football Classic</a>, which featured the top high school football players in Pennsylvania.

After graduating from high school, Zolak played <a href="college%20football">college football</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a>. He sat out his freshmen year, and became the third-string quarterback behind Dan Henning and <a href="Neil%20O%27Donnell">Neil O'Donnell</a> after two quarterbacks transferred. By the end of his sophomore season, Zolak was challenging O'Donnell for the starting job after Henning graduated. As his junior year began, in the summer of 1988, offensive coordinator <a href="Bob%20Valesente">Bob Valesente</a> said that Zolak was making tremendous strides as a quarterback, but O'Donnell was the starting quarterback that year. Zolak's first collegiate appearance came against <a href="1988%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">West Virginia</a>. He <a href="completion%20%28American%20football%29">completed</a> four of six <a href="forward%20pass">passes</a> for 28 yards, but had an <a href="interception">interception</a> returned for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> by <a href="Bo%20Orlando">Bo Orlando</a> in a 55–24 loss. He appeared in four games for Maryland that season.

Zolak was again the backup behind O'Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, completing 33 of 69 passes for 407 yards and two touchdowns. In 1990, after O'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the <a href="List%20of%20Maryland%20Terrapins%20quarterbacks">starter for Maryland</a>, and head coach <a href="Joe%20Krivak">Joe Krivak</a> had high hopes for him heading into the season. In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against <a href="1990%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech</a>, 20–13. The following week, he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th ranked <a href="1990%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">West Virginia</a>, 14–10. However, he was struggling in other aspects of his game. In an October game against <a href="1990%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a>, Zolak was <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times. By the end of the season, as Maryland was preparing to face <a href="1990%20Louisiana%20Tech%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Louisiana Tech</a> in the <a href="1990%20Independence%20Bowl">1990 Independence Bowl</a>, he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589 yards and 10 touchdowns. The teams tied, 34–34, in Zolak's final collegiate appearance. At the time of his graduation, he ranked fifth in school history with 270 pass completions, seventh with 3,124 career passing yards, and second with 2,589 passing yards in a season. He was also named <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> Offensive Player of the Week four times.

The <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> selected Zolak with the 84th pick in the fourth round of the <a href="1991%20NFL%20Draft">1991</a> <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a>. Scouting reports noted that his size and arm strength were great for the NFL, though there were concerns about his accuracy. Upon drafting him, Patriots Vice President of Player Operations Joe Mendes agreed that his size and arm would translate to the NFL, and he was not worried about any accuracy issues. His drafting led to a shakeup with the Patriots' current quarterbacks, as <a href="Marc%20Wilson%20%28American%20football%29">Marc Wilson</a> announced his retirement and longtime starting quarterback <a href="Steve%20Grogan">Steve Grogan</a> was released. Zolak agreed on a contract with the Patriots in July, and was the second-to-last person to <a href="%3Awikt%3Ahold%20out">hold out</a> after <a href="Leonard%20Russell">Leonard Russell</a>. Zolak spent the <a href="1991%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">1991 season</a> as the third-string quarterback, behind <a href="Hugh%20Millen">Hugh Millen</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Hodson">Tommy Hodson</a>, and did not take the field.

At the start of the <a href="1992%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">1992 season</a>, Zolak also looked unlikely to appear, being behind Hodson and Millen on the <a href="depth%20chart">depth chart</a>. Millen started the first five games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>. Relieving Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 31–14. The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261 yards, two <a href="touchdowns">touchdowns</a>, and an <a href="interception">interception</a> in the Patriots' first win of the season, 37–34. As a result of his performance, he was named the <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) Player of the Week. The next week, Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. He completed seven of 16 passes for 102 yards, getting help from <a href="Jon%20Vaughn">Jon Vaughn</a> who had 110 rushing yards, and the Patriots won, 24–3. However, the following week's performance against the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> was less impressive. He completed nine of 16 passes for 58 yards and two interceptions in the Patriots' losing effort, and he said it felt like he was "on a desert island by myself." After Zolak's performance against Atlanta, he lost the starting job, and Millen again filled that role. However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. Zolak injured his ankle at the end of the third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as <a href="Jeff%20Carlson%20%28American%20football%29">Jeff Carlson</a> took over quarterbacking duties. Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561 yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a <a href="quarterback%20rating">quarterback rating</a> of 58.8.

In 1993, the Patriots and new head coach <a href="Bill%20Parcells">Bill Parcells</a> were looking to improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed <a href="Scott%20Secules">Scott Secules</a>, and attempted to sign <a href="Steve%20Beuerlein">Steve Beuerlein</a>, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen was traded to the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, and the Patriots chose <a href="Drew%20Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a> with the first pick in the <a href="1993%20NFL%20Draft">1993 NFL Draft</a>. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a <a href="restricted%20free%20agent">restricted free agent</a> in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As was the case in the 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the <a href="holder%20%28American%20football%29">holder</a> for extra point and <a href="field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28 yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The <a href="1995%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">1995 season</a> was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252 yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 30–17. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282 yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.

The <a href="1996%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">1996 season</a> began well for Zolak, whose contract was extended through 1998. However, to remain with the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a>. While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from <a href="Jay%20Barker">Jay Barker</a>. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp. By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and <a href="Tom%20Tupa">Tom Tupa</a> serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards. He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, but did not play in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXI">Super Bowl XXXI</a>. Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight, which Zolak did throughout much of the season. The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots did have a new coach in <a href="Pete%20Carroll">Pete Carroll</a>. As training camp ended, Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells. As the regular season came and went, however, he had minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67 yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.

With Zolak coming to the final year of his contract in <a href="1998%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season">1998</a>, he sat in his usual spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during the first three months of the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33 yards and an interception in a 41–10 loss. Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game. Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995. Zolak's first start came against the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> on December 20. He completed 14 of 30 passes for 205 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and won the game, 24–21. He faced the New York Jets the following week, completing 14 of 31 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown, but lost the game 31–10. Zolak finished the season with his most productive totals since 1992. He played in six games and started two, completed 32 of 75 passes for 371 yards, three touchdowns, three interceptions, and had a passer rating of 61.8. Zolak's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs, as Bledsoe was still injured, against the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 25–10 loss. He became an <a href="unrestricted%20free%20agent">unrestricted free agent</a> after the season ended, but was not asked back by the Patriots, ending his tenure there.

After leaving the Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year contract by the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. With <a href="Vinny%20Testaverde">Vinny Testaverde</a> considered the starter, Zolak was competing against <a href="Ray%20Lucas">Ray Lucas</a> for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed <a href="Rick%20Mirer">Rick Mirer</a> and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team. Two days after acquiring Mirer from the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, the Jets released Zolak. In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> to serve as the backup quarterback behind <a href="Damon%20Huard">Damon Huard</a> and <a href="Jim%20Druckenmiller">Jim Druckenmiller</a>. He was later made the backup behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots. As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year. Despite the retirement of <a href="Dan%20Marino">Dan Marino</a>, the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000. Zolak trained for the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> during the summer after they lost <a href="Mike%20Tomczak">Mike Tomczak</a> for the season, but instead he signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside <a href="Bob%20Lobel">Bob Lobel</a> in August, ending his professional football career.

HMS Speedy (1782)

HMS "Speedy" was a 14-gun <a href="Speedy-class%20brig">"Speedy"-class brig</a> of the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Built during the last years of the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a>, she served with distinction during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>.

Built at <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, "Speedy" spent most of the interwar years serving off the British coast. Transferred to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, she spent the rest of her career there under a number of notable commanders, winning fame for herself in various engagements and often against heavy odds. Her first commander in the Mediterranean, <a href="Charles%20Cunningham">Charles Cunningham</a>, served with distinction with several squadrons, assisting in the capture of several <a href="war%20prize">war prize</a>s, such as the French frigates and <a href="HMS%20Imperieuse%20%281793%29">"Impérieuse"</a>. His successor, <a href="George%20Cockburn">George Cockburn</a>, impressed his superiors with his dogged devotion to duty. "Speedy"s next commander, <a href="George%20Eyre">George Eyre</a>, had the misfortune to lose her to a superior <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French</a> force on 9 June 1794.

She was soon retaken, and re-entered service under <a href="Hugh%20Downman">Hugh Downman</a>, who captured a number of <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s between 1795 and 1799 and fought off an attack by the large French privateer "Papillon" on 3 February 1798. His successor, <a href="Jahleel%20Brenton">Jahleel Brenton</a>, fought a number of actions against <a href="Enlightenment%20in%20Spain%23Trouble%20abroad%20%281788%E2%80%931808%29">Spanish</a> forces off <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Her last captain, <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Lord Cochrane</a>, forced the surrender of a much larger Spanish warship, the "<a href="Spanish%20frigate%20El%20Gamo">Gamo</a>". "Speedy" was finally captured by a powerful French squadron in 1801 and donated to the <a href="Papal%20Navy">Papal Navy</a> by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> the following year. She spent five years with them under the name "San Paolo", but was struck around 1806.

"Speedy" was one of two <a href="Sloop-of-war%23Brig%20sloop">brig-sloops</a> built to the same design by Thomas King of <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, Kent. She and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> were constructed to provide small, fast escort vessels with hulls shaped like a <a href="cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a>, rather than the more seaworthy but slower <a href="Sloop-of-war">ship-sloop</a>. King had for some time specialised in these types of vessels, and the design capitalised on that experience. "Speedy" was so named to symbolise this new approach, and measured 207 tons <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">bm</a> with a total length of . She was armed with fourteen four-pounder and twelve half-pounder <a href="swivel%20gun">swivel gun</a>s, and carried a complement of 90 men. Ordered on 23 March 1781, she was laid down at King's yard in June that year and launched on 29 June 1782. She moved to <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Deptford</a>, Kent, to be <a href="fitting-out">fitted-out</a> and have her hull covered with <a href="Copper%20sheathing">copper plates</a> between 16 July and 25 October 1782; at her completion she had cost <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>4,200 7<a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">s</a> 3<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> to build.

"Speedy" was commissioned under <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commander</a> <a href="Josias%20Rogers">Josias Rogers</a> in May 1783 and was assigned to serve in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, operating out of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a> estuary. After four years on this station she was <a href="Ship%20commissioning%23Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> (placed in reserve) in January 1787 and began a refit at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> in April that year. This work was completed by July at a cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,801, and she was recommissioned in May that year under Commander John Maude, still on the Humber station.

From November 1790 she was under Commander Richard Lane, who was her captain until she was paid off in October 1791. "Speedy" then underwent another refit, this time at Deptford between June and December 1792, at a cost of £3,000, and was recommissioned in November 1792 under Commander <a href="Charles%20Cunningham">Charles Cunningham</a>.

Cunningham had previously been serving in the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> in command of the 16-gun sloop . By the time he returned to take up his new command the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> had broken out and he was sent to join <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Lord Hood</a> fleet in the Mediterranean, arriving there in April 1793. He was largely employed in carrying despatches and maintaining communications with other ships scattered throughout the Mediterranean ports. On 5 October 1793 "Speedy" accompanied and into <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, where they captured a French <a href="frigate">frigate</a>, <a href="HMS%20Modeste%20%281793%29">"Modeste"</a>, and two armed <a href="tartane">tartane</a>s in the <a href="Raid%20on%20Genoa">Raid on Genoa</a>. In this action, "Speedy" sent two boats to board the tartanes while "Bedford" bombarded "Modeste". The French crews of the tartanes attempted to resist and two of their crewmembers were wounded, but the British did not suffer any casualties. "Captain" and "Speedy" then sailed to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Spezia">Gulf of Spezia</a> where they caught another French frigate, <a href="HMS%20Imperieuse%20%281793%29">"Imperieuse"</a>, at anchor. "Imperieuse" was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> by her crew, but was subsequently salvaged and recommissioned as HMS "Imperieuse". Cunningham was promoted to captain and given command of the <a href="prize%20%28law%29">prize</a>, with his commission backdated to the day of the capture, 12 October 1793.
Cunningham was replaced by Commander <a href="George%20Cockburn">George Cockburn</a> in the command of "Speedy", which remained in the Mediterranean. His first duties were limited to carrying despatches and passengers between <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> and Genoa, after which he was ordered to join Captain Sutherland of , who was commanding a <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> blockading Genoa. The small fleet was caught in winter storms and several ships were badly damaged, forcing Sutherland and his squadron to seek shelter in nearby ports and to make repairs, with the exception of "Speedy", which remained on station. Sutherland put into <a href="Hy%C3%A8res">Hyères</a> Bay and reported the dispersal of his squadron to Lord Hood, also noting that nothing had been heard of "Speedy" since the gales. Once "Diadem" had been repaired Sutherland returned to Genoa, and was surprised to discover "Speedy" still there patrolling the port, not once having left her task. While single-handedly maintaining the blockade, she had managed to capture several vessels. Sutherland ordered "Speedy", which was by now running desperately short of water, to Hyères to refit. At the same time, Sutherland sent a complimentary report of Cockburn to Lord Hood. On 20 January 1794, Cockburn was rewarded with an acting commission as <a href="post-captain">post-captain</a> of the frigate , followed a month later by a permanent command of the frigate .

Commander <a href="George%20Eyre">George Eyre</a> took over command of "Speedy" in February 1794. "Speedy" supported the siege and capture of <a href="Bastia">Bastia</a>, after which Eyre was ordered to join "Diadem" off <a href="Nice">Nice</a>. While making his way there on 9 June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Martin%20%28naval%20officer%29">Pierre Martin</a>, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and "Speedy" was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship and was told that the <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a> had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or <a href="Hanoverians">Hanoverians</a>, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk "Speedy". The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to <a href="Gourjean">Gourjean</a> <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> outside Toulon, taking "Speedy" and the captured British crew with them.

"Speedy" spent only a brief time sailing under the French flag. On 25 March 1795 her captain mistook Captain <a href="Thomas%20Fremantle%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Fremantle's</a> "Inconstant" for a French ship and she was recaptured and taken back into British service.

In early March the following year, "Speedy", under the command of Thomas Elphinstone, joined a squadron cruising off <a href="Oneglia">Oneglia, Italy</a>, under Commodore <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, consisting of the 64-gun ships and HMS "Diadem", the 32-gun frigates and and the ship-sloop . On 25 April the squadron steered for Laöna bay, the commodore having received intelligence that a large convoy, laden with stores for the French army, had anchored off the town of Finale. When the squadron arrived, however, they found only four vessels moored under the guns of some batteries. The shore batteries opened fire on "Peterel" as she led the boats of the squadron to the attack. Despite the fire, the British were able to capture the four vessels and suffered only three men wounded.

In an <a href="Action%20of%2031%20May%201796">action on 31 May</a> the squadron chased the French <a href="ketch">ketch</a> "Genie", a gunboat of one gun, and five merchant ships, which took refuge near the guns of a shore battery. At 3 p.m. "Agamemnon", "Blanche", "Peterel" and "Speedy" approached them and anchored in of water. The four British ships fired their cannons, which disabled the shore battery, and then sent in several boats under heavy fire from the guns of "Genie" and the gunboat; the British successfully boarded and captured both ships. In the meantime, the merchant ships had beached themselves to avoid capture. Under heavy <a href="musket">musket</a> fire from the beach, the British captured and re-floated the four merchant vessels, and destroyed one. Among the British, one man was killed and three were wounded in the operation.

Elphinstone was succeeded in August 1797 by Commander <a href="Hugh%20Downman">Hugh Downman</a>, who made several cruises with "Speedy".

During his time in command of "Speedy", Downman captured five privateers, altogether mounting 17 guns and 28 <a href="swivel%20gun">swivels</a>, and carrying 162 men.

These five were:
Head money was finally paid in June 1829.

On 3 February 1798 "Speedy" encountered the large <a href="privateer">privateer</a> "Papillon", mounting 18 guns and carrying 160 men, while sailing off <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>. "Papillon" attacked "Speedy", which had a reduced crew; her <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">master</a> Mr Marshall and 12 men were aboard a Spanish prize "Speedy" had taken earlier. The two ships fought each other for two days; by the second day Downman had exhausted his supply of shot, and resorted to firing nails and pieces of iron hoop at his opponent. Having observed his captain's predicament, Marshall secured the Spanish crew below deck and took the prize crew off in a small boat to go to Downman's assistance. After a fierce fight "Speedy" succeeded in driving off "Papillon"; "Speedy" suffered losses of five killed and four wounded. Downman then recaptured his prize and returned to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> to carry out repairs.

For his efforts in protecting British trade out of <a href="Oporto">Oporto</a>, the merchants there presented him with a letter of thanks, and a <a href="Silver%20%28household%29">piece of plate</a> valued at £50. As a reward for his good service, Downman was advanced to <a href="post-captain">post-captain</a> on 26 December 1798 and appointed commander of the 32-gun , a frigate that had recently been captured from the Spanish in the <a href="Action%20of%2015%20July%201798">Action of 15 July 1798</a>.

Downman was succeeded in January of the following year by Commander <a href="Jahleel%20Brenton">Jahleel Brenton</a>, who was based at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. While sailing off Gibraltar in company with the British privateer "Defender" on 9 August 1799, Brenton came across three small Spanish warships, mounting twenty 6-pounders in total. The Spanish <a href="Sailing%23Running">ran</a> into a small sandy bay and anchored in a line so as to bring their guns to bear simultaneously on the British ships. "Speedy" and "Defender" sailed up and down for two hours firing <a href="Broadside%23As%20a%20measurement">broadsides</a>, but without much effect. "Defender" only had 22 men on board and decided to sail further out to sea to meet one of her boats. Brenton thought the effort of keeping under sail was aiding the enemy, and anchored "Speedy" within of the middle ship. The two exchanged a fierce cannonade for three quarters of an hour, after which the Spanish abandoned their ships and made for the shore. Two of the ships ran ashore and the third was immediately captured. "Speedy" launched her boats to recover the other two, coming under musket fire from the Spanish on the hillside as they did so. The British got both vessels off and took them into Gibraltar, along with two men wounded during the operation.

On 3 October "Speedy", while sailing once again off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships coming out of <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a>, gunboats apparently attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On "Speedy"s approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. "Speedy" approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, it was impossible to get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, "Speedy" was standing off <a href="Europa%20Point">Europa Point</a> when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the "Unity", was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of "Speedy", but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the "Unity" when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. "Speedy" suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to <a href="T%C3%A9touan">Tétouan</a> Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of "Speedy". When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General <a href="Charles%20O%27Hara">Charles O'Hara</a>, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.

Brenton was promoted to <a href="post-captain">post-captain</a>, and in March 1800 Commander <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Lord Cochrane</a> took over. Cochrane was less than impressed with his new command, declaring that "Speedy" was "little more than a burlesque of a vessel of war". His cabin had only of headroom; when Cochrane wished to shave he had to open a skylight and set his shaving equipment out on the quarterdeck. On another occasion he walked the quarterdeck with "Speedy"s entire broadside, seven pieces of four-pounder shot, in his pockets. In an attempt to increase the firepower of his new command he asked for and was given two 12-pounder long guns to use as bow and stern chasers, but the <a href="scantling">scantling</a>s could not support them and they had to be removed. He then requested his 4-pounders be upgraded to 6-pounders, but his gunports were not big enough. He had better luck with his mast, taking a spar from <a href="French%20ship%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9reux%20%281785%29">HMS "Genereux"</a> that was considered too large for "Speedy", but which Cochrane felt improved her speed.

In early May Cochrane was escorting a convoy from <a href="Cagliari">Cagliari</a> to <a href="Livorno">Leghorn</a>. On 11 May a ship which turned out to be the 6-gun privateer "Intrépide" was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane chased the "Intrépide" and forced her to surrender. Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of <a href="Montecristo">Montecristo</a>, five rowing boats emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning. He was then given a free hand to raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured seven or eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer "Asuncion" off Bastia on 25 June and the privateer "Constitution" off <a href="Caprea">Caprea</a> on 19 July. On 22 September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into <a href="Mah%C3%B3n">Port Mahon</a>, discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his <a href="Raid%20%28military%29">depredation</a>s and were preparing a frigate to capture "Speedy".

Cochrane prepared for an encounter with this Spanish vessel by painting "Speedy" to resemble a Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the "Clomer". He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform. While cruising off <a href="Alicante">Alicante</a> on 21 December, "Speedy" encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22 January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.

Then on 24 February Cochrane captured the French naval brig "Caroline", of four guns, which had been carrying ordnance stores from Genoa to Alexandria.

"Speedy" was cruising off <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> at dawn on 6 May 1801 when she sighted a large enemy frigate. The frigate, a <a href="xebec">xebec</a>-rigged vessel named "<a href="Spanish%20frigate%20El%20Gamo">Gamo</a>", carrying 319 men, was armed with 8- and 12-pounder guns and 24-pounder <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s. This amounted to a total broadside of 190 pounds, more than seven times that of "Speedy". Furthermore, Cochrane had only 54 men on board; the rest were serving as prize crews. Instead of evading the frigate, Cochrane closed on her, and at 9:30 a.m. "Gamo" fired a gun and hoisted Spanish colours. In return Cochrane hoisted American colours. The Spanish hesitated, allowing Cochrane to get closer, hoist British colours, and evade the first broadside. "Gamo" fired another, which Cochrane again evaded, holding fire until "Speedy" ran alongside and locked her <a href="nautical%20terms%23Y">yards</a> in "Gamo" rigging. "Gamo" attempted to fire upon her smaller opponent, but her guns were mounted too high and could not be depressed sufficiently, causing their shot to pass through "Speedy"s sails and rigging. Cochrane then opened fire with his 4-pounders <a href="double-shotted">double- and treble-shotted</a>, their shots passing up through the sides and decks, killing the Spanish captain and boatswain with the first broadside.

Seeing their disadvantage the Spanish second-in-command assembled a boarding party, at which Cochrane drew off and pounded their massed ranks with shot and musket fire before drawing in close again. After having their attempts to board frustrated three times, the Spanish returned to their guns. Cochrane then decided to board the "Gamo", and assembled his entire crew into two parties, leaving only the ship's doctor aboard. The British rushed the "Gamo", some boarding from the bow with faces blackened to look like pirates, the rest boarding from the <a href="Nautical%20terms%23W">waist</a>. There was a hard-fought battle between the two crews, until Cochrane called down to the doctor, at the time the only person on "Speedy", ordering him to send another 50 men over. At the same time he ordered the Spanish colours to be torn down. Thinking that their officers had surrendered the ship, the remaining Spanish seamen stopped fighting. The British had lost three men killed and nine wounded, while the Spanish had lost 14 killed and 41 wounded, a casualty list exceeding "Speedy"s entire complement. The British then secured the Spanish prisoners below deck and made their way back to Port Mahon. Stung that he had been beaten by such an inferior foe, the Spanish second-in-command asked Cochrane for a certificate assuring him that he had done all he could to defend his ship. Cochrane obliged, with the equivocal wording that he had "conducted himself like a true Spaniard". Cochrane was amused to learn that this certificate had later secured the Spanish officer further advancement. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a> with clasp "Speedy 6 May 1801" to all surviving claimants from the action.

Cochrane returned to the coast off Barcelona in June 1801, and joined the 16-gun in attacking a Spanish convoy of 12 merchant ships and 5 armed vessels anchored under the guns of a large tower. After a sharp action fought between the afternoon of 9 June and the morning of 10 June, the two ships sank or drove ashore all of the ships with the exception of three brigs, which they captured. Three weeks later he was cruising off Alicante when he encountered several merchant vessels, which ran ashore. Rather than wasting time trying to get them off, he burnt them, but in doing so attracted the attention of a foe vastly more powerful than the "Gamo".

A formidable French squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral <a href="Charles-Alexandre%20L%C3%A9on%20Durand%20Linois">Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois</a> had left Toulon bound for <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. On 3 July they sighted and chased "Speedy", and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to lighten the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of "Desaix", Cochrane <a href="striking%20the%20colors">struck his colours</a>. He was taken aboard "Desaix", where her captain, <a href="Jean-Anne%20Christy%20de%20la%20Palli%C3%A8re">Christy-Pallière</a>, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the <a href="Battle%20of%20Algeciras%20Bay">Battle of Algeciras Bay</a> from "Desaix". He and the crew of "Speedy" were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.

The French took "Speedy" to Toulon with the fleet, where she became a pawn in <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="Napoleon%20and%20the%20Catholic%20Church">efforts at diplomacy</a> with <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a>, whose presence he wanted at his coronation as emperor. "Speedy", by now named "Saint Paul" and inscribed with the words "Donné par le premier consul Bonaparte au Pape Pie VII" ("Given by the <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> Bonaparte to Pope Pius VII") in gilt letters on her <a href="poop%20cabin">poop cabin</a>, sailed with an escort from Toulon on 14 December 1802 bound for <a href="Civitavecchia">Civitavecchia</a> as a present to the Pope. She arrived there on 16 December where the <a href="Papal%20Navy">Papal Navy</a> took her into service under the name "San Paulo". She remained there until being struck c.1806.

Some of "Speedy"s later exploits under Cochrane were used in the plot of the novel "<a href="Master%20and%20Commander">Master and Commander</a>", part of <a href="Patrick%20O%27Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a>'s <a href="Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin%20series">Aubrey–Maturin series</a>, though the ship described by O'Brian matches only "Speedy" <a href="spar%20%28sailing%29">spar</a> dimensions and armament, and is named HMS "Sophie". Cochrane is replaced in the book by the fictional <a href="Jack%20Aubrey">Jack Aubrey</a>, who repeats many of Cochrane's real-life exploits including the defence of a convoy and the recapture of one of its merchants from a privateer, and the capture of a large Spanish frigate, based on the "Gamo", but renamed "Cacafuego" for the novel.

James B. McCreary

James Bennett McCreary (July 8, 1838 – October 8, 1918) was an American lawyer and politician from the US state of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He represented the state in both houses of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> and served as its <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">27th and 37th</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor</a>. Shortly after graduating from law school, he was commissioned as the only <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> in the <a href="11th%20Kentucky%20Cavalry">11th Kentucky Cavalry</a>, serving under <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> Brigadier General <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. He returned to his legal practice after the war. In 1869, he was elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> where he served until 1875; he was twice chosen <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>. At their 1875 nominating convention, state <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> chose McCreary as their nominee for governor, and he won an easy victory over <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a>. With the state still feeling the effects of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, most of McCreary's actions as governor were aimed at easing the plight of the state's poor farmers.

In 1884, McCreary was elected to the first of six consecutive terms in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. As a legislator, he was an advocate of <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>, McCreary secured the support of Governor <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.

Campaigning on a platform of <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> reforms, McCreary defeated Republican <a href="Edward%20C.%20O%27Rear">Edward C. O'Rear</a> in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) <a href="Kentucky%20Governor%27s%20Mansion">governor's mansion</a>; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">old</a> and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women eligible to vote</a> in school board elections, to mandate direct <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a>s, to create a state <a href="public%20utilities%20commission">public utilities commission</a>, and to allow the state's counties to hold <a href="local%20option">local option</a> elections to decide whether or not to adopt <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a>. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a <a href="workers%27%20compensation">workers' compensation</a> program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. <a href="McCreary%20County%2C%20Kentucky">McCreary County</a> was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.

James Bennett McCreary was born in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Kentucky">Richmond, Kentucky</a>, on July 8, 1838. He was the son of Edmund R. and Sabrina (Bennett) McCreary. He obtained his early education in the region's common schools, then matriculated to <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1857. Immediately thereafter, he enrolled at <a href="Cumberland%20University">Cumberland University</a> in <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee">Lebanon, Tennessee</a>, to study law. In 1859, he earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> from Cumberland and was <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> of his class of forty-seven students; he was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> and commenced practice at Richmond.

Shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Richmond">Battle of Richmond</a> on August 29, 1862, <a href="David%20Waller%20Chenault">David Waller Chenault</a>, a Confederate sympathizer from <a href="Madison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Madison County</a>, came to Richmond to raise a Confederate regiment. On September 10, 1862, Chenault was commissioned as a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> and given command of the regiment, dubbed the <a href="11th%20Kentucky%20Cavalry">11th Kentucky Cavalry</a>. McCreary joined the regiment and was commissioned as a <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>, the only one in the unit. The 11th Kentucky Cavalry was pressed into immediate service, conducting <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> and fighting <a href="bushwhacker">bushwhacker</a>s. Just three months after its muster, they helped the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a> secure a victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hartsville">Battle of Hartsville</a>. In 1863, the unit joined <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a> for his <a href="Morgan%27s%20Raid">raid into Ohio</a>. Colonel Chenault was killed as the Confederates tried to capture the <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green River</a> Bridge at the July 4, 1863, <a href="Battle%20of%20Tebbs%20Bend">Battle of Tebbs Bend</a>. McCreary assumed command of the unit after Chenault's death. Following the battle, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on the recommendation of <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>.

Most of the 11th Kentucky Cavalry was captured by <a href="Union%20Army">Union forces</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buffington%20Island">Battle of Buffington Island</a> on July 17, 1863. Approximately two hundred men, commanded by McCreary, mounted a charge and escaped their captors, but they were surrounded the next day and surrendered. McCreary was taken to Ninth Street Prison in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, but was later transferred to <a href="Fort%20Delaware">Fort Delaware</a> and eventually to <a href="Morris%20Island">Morris Island</a>, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, where he remained a prisoner through July and most of August 1863. In late August, he was released as part of a <a href="prisoner%20exchange">prisoner exchange</a> and taken to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. He was granted a thirty-day <a href="furlough">furlough</a> before being put in command of a <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of Kentucky and South Carolina troops. He commanded this unit, primarily on scouting missions, until the end of the war.

Following the war, McCreary resumed his legal practice. On June 12, 1867, McCreary married Katherine Hughes, the only daughter of a wealthy <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a> farmer. The couple had one son.

McCreary was nominated to serve as a <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">presidential elector</a> for the ticket of Democrat <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a> in 1868; though he declined to serve, he attended the <a href="1868%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">national convention</a> as a delegate. His political career began in earnest in 1869 when he was elected to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>.

In 1871, McCreary was re-elected to the state House without opposition. In the upcoming legislative session, the major question was expected to be the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Texas%20Pacific%20Railway">Cincinnati Southern Railway</a>'s request for authorization to build a track connecting <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, with either <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a> or <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, through Central Kentucky. The action was opposed by the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>, a bitter rival of the Cincinnati line. Appeals to the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> to oppose the bill on grounds that an out-of-state corporation should not be granted a charter in the state were successful in 1869 and 1870, and an attempt by the federal Congress to grant the charter was defeated by <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> legislators there. Moreover, newly elected governor <a href="Preston%20Leslie">Preston Leslie</a> had opposed a bill granting Cincinnati Southern's request when he was in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state Senate</a> in 1869. In the lead-up to the 1871 session, frustrated Central Kentuckians threatened to defect from the Democratic Party in future elections if the bill were not passed in the session. Supporters of Cincinnati Southern won a victory when McCreary, a staunch supporter of the bill to grant the line's request, was elected <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>. After approval of a series of amendments designed to give Kentucky courts some jurisdiction in cases involving the line and the Kentucky General Assembly some measure of control over the line's activities, the bill passed the House by a vote of 59–38. The vote in the Senate resulted in a 19–19 tie; <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">President Pro Tem</a> <a href="John%20G.%20Carlisle">John G. Carlisle</a>—a native of <a href="Covington%2C%20Kentucky">Covington</a>, through which the proposed line would pass—cast the deciding vote in favor of approving Cincinnati Southern's request. With the will of the people clearly expressed through the legislature, Governor Leslie did not employ his gubernatorial veto. McCreary was again returned to the House without opposition in 1873 and was again chosen Speaker of the House during his term.

In 1875, McCreary was one of four men, all former Confederate soldiers, who sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being <a href="John%20Stuart%20Williams">John Stuart Williams</a>, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was considered the favorite for the nomination at the outset of the Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers in the western part of the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.
The Republicans nominated <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a>, who had served in the Union Army. In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by Republican President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> during the <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction Era</a>. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of <a href="clemency">pardons</a> granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.

At the time of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the youngest first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol building by the time of McCreary's inauguration, he was able to move the official governor's office out of the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">governor's mansion</a>, freeing his family from the intrusion of public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office is believed to be the last official act performed by a governor there.

In the wake of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, the electorate was primarily concerned with economic issues. In his first address to the General Assembly, McCreary focused on economic issues to the near exclusion of providing any leadership or direction in the area of government reforms. (In later years, McCreary's unwillingness to take a definite stand on key issues of reform would earn him the nicknames "Bothsides" McCreary and "Oily Jeems".) In response to McCreary's address, legislators from the rural, agrarian areas of the state proposed lowering the maximum legal interest rate from ten percent to six percent. The proposed legislation drew the ire of bankers and capitalists; it was also widely panned in the press, notably by "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" editor <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a>. Ultimately, the Assembly compromised on a legal interest rate of eight percent. Another bill to lower the <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a> rate from 45 to 40 cents per 100 dollars of taxable property encountered far less resistance and passed easily. Few bills passed during the session had statewide impact, despite McCreary's insistence that the legislature prefer general bills over bills of local impact. This fact, too, was widely criticized by the state's newspapers.

The issue of improving navigation along the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a> was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold benefits to the state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought it back to the floor in the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.

Also in the 1878 session, tax assessments for railroad property were raised to match those of other property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>) from Kentucky University (later <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>) and the establishment of a state board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the session, representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.

Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, <a href="William%20Lindsay%20%28Kentucky%29">William Lindsay</a>, and <a href="J.%20Proctor%20Knott">J. Proctor Knott</a>, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was nominated for a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite behind one of their four candidates. After more than a week of <a href="caucus">caucus</a>ing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.

Following his term as governor, McCreary returned to his legal practice. In 1884, he sought election to Congress from <a href="Kentucky%27s%208th%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's Eighth District</a>. His opponents for the Democratic nomination were <a href="Milton%20J.%20Durham">Milton J. Durham</a> and <a href="Philip%20B.%20Thompson%2C%20Jr.">Philip B. Thompson, Jr.</a>, both of whom had held the district's seat previously. McCreary bested both men, and in the general election in November, defeated Republican James Sebastian by a margin of 2,146 votes. It was the largest margin of victory by a Democrat in the Eighth District.

During his tenure, McCreary represented Kentucky's agricultural interests, introducing a bill to create the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a>. A bill containing most of the same provisions as the one McCreary authored was passed later in the session. He also proposed a successful amendment to the <a href="Wilson%E2%80%93Gorman%20Tariff%20Act">Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act</a> that excluded farm implements and machinery from the tariff. An advocate of <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>, he was appointed by President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> to be a delegate to the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Conference">International Monetary Conference</a> held in <a href="Brussels%2C%20Belgium">Brussels, Belgium</a>, in 1892. As chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">House Committee on Foreign Affairs</a>, he authored a bill to establish a court that would settle disputed land claims stemming from the <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe-Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo</a>. He advocated the creation of a railroad linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1890, he sponsored a bill authorizing the first <a href="Pan-American%20Conference">Pan-American Conference</a> and was an advocate of the Pan-American Medical Conference that met in Washington, D.C., in 1893. He authored a report declaring American hostility to European ownership of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and sponsored legislation authorizing the U.S. president to retaliate against foreign vessels that harassed American fishing boats.
In 1890, McCreary's name was again placed in nomination for a U.S. Senate seat to succeed <a href="James%20B.%20Beck">James B. Beck</a>, who died in office. John G. Carlisle, J. Proctor Knott, William Lindsay, <a href="Laban%20T.%20Moore">Laban T. Moore</a>, and <a href="Evan%20E.%20Settle">Evan E. Settle</a> were also nominated by various factions of the Democratic Party; Republicans nominated <a href="Silas%20Adams">Silas Adams</a>. Carlisle was elected on the ninth ballot. McCreary continued his service in the House until 1896, when he was defeated in his bid for a seventh consecutive nomination for the seat. In that same year, his was among a myriad of names put forward for election to the Senate, but he never received more than 13 votes. Following these defeats, he resumed his law practice in Richmond.

McCreary campaigned for Democrat <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a> during the controversial <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201899">1899 gubernatorial campaign</a>. Between 1900 and 1912, he represented Kentucky at four consecutive <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a>s. Governor J. C. W. Beckham and his well-established <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> supported McCreary's nomination to the Senate in 1902. His opponent, incumbent <a href="William%20J.%20Deboe">William J. Deboe</a>, had been elected as a compromise candidate six years earlier, becoming Kentucky's first-ever Republican senator. Deboe had done little to secure support from legislators since his election, however, and McCreary was easily elected by a vote of 95–30. Following his election to the Senate, McCreary supported Beckham's gubernatorial re-election bid in 1903. In a largely undistinguished term as a senator, he continued to advocate the free coinage of silver and tried to advance the state's agricultural interests.

McCreary's senate term was set to expire in 1908, the same year as Beckham's second term as governor. Desiring election to the Senate following his gubernatorial term, Beckham persuaded his Democratic allies to choose the party's nominees for governor and senator by a <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> held in 1906 – a year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. This ensured that the primary would occur during his term as governor, when he still wielded significant influence within the party. McCreary now allied himself with <a href="J.%20C.%20S.%20Blackburn">J. C. S. Blackburn</a>, Henry Watterson, and other Beckham opponents, and sought to defend his seat in the primary. During the primary campaign, he pointed to his record of dealing with national issues, contrasting it with Beckham's youth and inexperience at the national level. Beckham countered by citing his strong stand in favor of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>, as opposed to McCreary's more moderate position, and by touting his support of a primary election instead of a nominating convention, which he said gave the voters a choice in who would represent them in the Senate. Ultimately, Beckham prevailed in the primary by an 11,000-vote margin, rendering McCreary a <a href="Lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a> with two years still left in his term.

Despite Beckham's move to unseat McCreary in the Senate, the two were once again allies by 1911, when Beckham supported the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation in order to secure the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.

Republicans nominated Judge <a href="Edward%20C.%20O%27Rear">Edward C. O'Rear</a> to oppose McCreary. There were few differences between the two men's stands on the issues. Both supported <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> reforms such as the <a href="direct%20election">direct election</a> of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, and the creation of a <a href="public%20utilities%20commission">public utilities commission</a>. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.

McCreary pointed out that O'Rear had been nominated at a party nominating convention instead of winning a primary, though O'Rear claimed to support primary elections. He also criticized O'Rear for continuing to receive his salary as a judge while running for governor. McCreary cited what he called the Republicans' record of "assassination, bloodshed, and disregard of law", an allusion to the assassination of William Goebel in the aftermath of the 1899 gubernatorial contest. <a href="Caleb%20Powers">Caleb Powers</a>, convicted three times of being an accessory to Goebel's murder, had been pardoned by Republican governor <a href="Augustus%20Willson">Augustus Willson</a> and had recently been elected to Congress. He further attacked the tariff policies of Republican President <a href="William%20H.%20Taft">William H. Taft</a>. In the general election, McCreary won a decisive victory, garnering 226,771 votes to O'Rear's 195,435. Several other minor party candidates also received votes, including <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist</a> candidate Walter Lanfersiek, who claimed 8,718 votes (2 percent of the total).

One of McCreary's first acts as governor was signing a bill appropriating $75,000 for the construction of a new <a href="Kentucky%20Governor%27s%20Mansion">governor's mansion</a>. The legislature appointed a commission of five, including McCreary, to oversee the mansion's construction. The governor exercised a good deal of influence over the process, including the replacement of a conservatory with a ballroom in the construction plan and the selection of a contractor from his hometown of Richmond as assistant superintendent of construction. Changing societal trends also affected construction. A hastily constructed stable to house horse-drawn carriages was soon abandoned in favor of a garage for automobiles.

The mansion was completed in 1914. Because McCreary was widowed before his second term in office, his granddaughter, Harriet Newberry McCreary, served as the mansion's first hostess during her summer vacations from her studies at <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>. When Harriet McCreary was away at college, McCreary's housekeeper, Jennie Shaw, served as hostess. McCreary authorized the state to sell the old mansion at auction, but the final bid of $13,600 was rejected as unfair by the mansion commission.

Among the progressive reforms advocated by McCreary and passed in the 1912 legislative session were making <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women eligible to vote</a> in school board elections, mandating direct <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a>s, and allowing the state's counties to hold <a href="local%20option">local option</a> elections to decide whether or not to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the <a href="Kentucky%20Public%20Service%20Commission">Kentucky Public Service Commission</a>. Near the close of the session, <a href="McCreary%20County%2C%20Kentucky">McCreary County</a> was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's 120 counties</a> to be constituted.

McCreary was not as successful in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive <a href="workmen%27s%20compensation">workmen's compensation</a> law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, but the majority of legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating <a href="Lobbying%20in%20the%20United%20States">lobbying</a> at the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">capitol</a> – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.

Part of the reason for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a three-way primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and <a href="Augustus%20O.%20Stanley">Augustus O. Stanley</a>; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to win the nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.

Following the expiration of his term as governor, McCreary continued to practice as a private attorney until his death on October 8, 1918. He was buried in Richmond Cemetery.

Constitution of Belarus

The Constitution of the Republic of Belarus (, ) is the ultimate <a href="law">law</a> of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>. Adopted in 1994, three years after the country <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">declared its independence</a> from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, this formal document establishes the framework of the Belarusian state and <a href="Government%20of%20Belarus">government</a> and enumerates the rights and freedoms of its citizens. The Constitution was drafted by the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, the former legislative body of the country, and was improved upon by citizens and legal experts. The contents of the Constitution include the <a href="preamble">preamble</a>, nine sections, and 146 articles.

The structure and substance of the Constitution were heavily influenced by constitutions of <a href="Western%20world">Western powers</a> and by Belarus' experiences during the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet era</a>. While much of the Constitution establishes the government's functions and powers, an entire section details rights and freedoms granted to citizens and residents. The Constitution has been amended twice since the original adoption, in 1996 and in 2004. Two <a href="referendum">referendum</a>s that were disputed by independent observers and government opposition leaders increased the power of the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">presidency</a> over the government and eliminated the <a href="term%20limit">term limit</a>s for the presidency.

The first attempt to codify the laws of the medieval state on the territory of what is now Belarus (the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>) took the form of <a href="Statutes%20of%20Lithuania">Statutes of Lithuania</a>, with the First Statute in power in 1529. The document, written in <a href="Old%20Belarusian%20language">Old Belarusian language</a>, fulfilled the role of the supreme law of the land.

In the 18th century the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, a federal entity consisting of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> and the <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Crown of the Kingdom of Poland</a>, faced a period of decline due to increasingly dysfunctional internal politics. In a belated attempt to rectify the situation, a constitution was adopted <a href="Constitution%20of%20May%203%2C%201791">on May 3, 1791</a> – one of the oldest codified national constitutions in the world.

The new constitution abolished the <a href="liberum%20veto">liberum veto</a> and banned the <a href="szlachta">szlachta</a>'s confederations, features that had crippled decision making the state. The constitution also provided for a separation of powers among legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, established "popular sovereignty" and extended political rights to the bourgeoisie. The peasantry saw their rights increased but it fell short of abolishing serfdom, which was reconfirmed. Religious tolerance was preserved, although the status of the Catholic faith was recognized.

<a href="Reciprocal%20Guarantee%20of%20Two%20Nations">Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations</a> of October 22, 1791 accompanied the constitution, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies.

The 1791 document remained in force for less than 19 months; after a brief <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Russian%20War%20of%201792">war with Russia</a>, it was annulled by the <a href="Grodno%20Sejm">Grodno Sejm</a> on 23 November 1793. By 1795, the Commonwealth was <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">partitioned</a> between <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20monarchy">Habsburg Austria</a>, with most of the lands of the Grand Duchy under the Russian rule.

<a href="Belarusian%20Democratic%20Republic">Belarus</a> adopted its first temporary constitution several months after declaring independence from the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, on October 11, 1918.

In 1919, after the occupation of the country by the Russian Bolsheviks, Belarus became a <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Republic (USSR)</a>, and a new constitution was adopted. Belarus continued to use this constitution until it – along with Russia, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and the <a href="Transcaucasus">Transcaucasus</a> – signed a treaty to form the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Now the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Byelorussian SSR), the country adopted its first Soviet-era constitution in 1927, complementing the recently adopted <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Constitution</a>. After a re-adoption in 1937, the Byelorussian SSR adopted its last Soviet-era constitution in 1978, mainly to reflect changes made in the 1977 Soviet Constitution.

When Belarus became independent from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed the <a href="Declaration%20of%20State%20Sovereignty%20of%20the%20Belarusian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>, proclaiming Byelorussian SSR acts legal priority over USSR ones (per article 7 of the Declaration, but this provision was inserted into 1978 Constitution only in August 1991) and formally starting a constitutional process in Republic. Soon afterwards, the government established a Constitution Commission to facilitate the adoption of a post-Soviet constitution. In November 1991, the commission sent the first of three drafts to the Supreme Soviet. Upon approval from the Supreme Soviet, the first draft was published in December 1991 in order for the Belarusian populace to make comments and suggestions. The commission submitted the third and final draft to the Supreme Soviet, where it was signed on March 15, 1994 by the Speaker of the Supreme Soviet and Head of State, <a href="Myechyslaw%20Hryb">Myechyslaw Hryb</a>. The gazette "Zvezda" officially published the Constitution fifteen days later. The Supreme Soviet passed a second law along with the Constitution, titled the Enactment Law, rendering the 1978 Byelorussian SSR Constitution and the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic void, with a few exceptions. The law, passed during the thirteenth session of the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a>, also provided transitional phases for office holders and government organs to form within two years. Every year since 1994, March 15 has been commemorated in Belarus as <a href="Constitution%20Day">Constitution Day</a>, a national holiday.

The Constitution introduces <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but must work together to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing the role of the prime minister. Of the fifteen former <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet republics</a>, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the <a href="USSR">USSR</a>. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, <a href="Stanislau%20Shushkevich">Stanislau Shushkevich</a>, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition <a href="Belarusian%20Popular%20Front">Belarusian Popular Front</a> criticized the final drafts due to the lack of balance between the two parties and for allowing <a href="Vyachaslau%20Kebich">Vyachaslau Kebich</a> to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.

When drafting the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies were influenced by the constitutions of various countries, including <a href="Constitution%20of%20Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20France">France</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Constitution%20of%20Sweden">Sweden</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States</a>. Internally, the Constitution was influenced by the period of Soviet domination and a desire to bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of the Constitution is similar to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Russian Federation</a>: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the <a href="President%20of%20Russia">President of Russia</a>. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.

In the <a href="preamble">preamble</a> of the Constitution, Belarus assumes the responsibility for its destiny as a member of the international community. To execute this responsibility, the government undertakes to show ""adherence to values common to all mankind, founding ourselves on our inalienable right to self-determination,"" which is ""supported by the centuries-long history of development of Belarusian statehood."" Belarus also pledges to honor the rights and freedoms of its citizens and to maintain a stable government that is run by the people and based on the rule of law.

Section One of the Constitution sets up the governmental framework and specifies that the government is run by the people of Belarus. The government, which has been declared a multi-party representative democracy, forms its own foreign policy and is willing to defend the right to do so when necessary. Section One also establishes that the state protects the rights and freedoms of its citizens, but contains the proviso that a citizen of Belarus ""bears a responsibility towards the State to discharge unwaveringly the duties imposed upon him by the Constitution.""

The government itself has a system of <a href="checks%20and%20balances">checks and balances</a> for each branch of the government, but all of the branches are to be independent from influence from the other branches. The government is authorized to pass laws conforming with the provisions of the Constitution, by which it is expected to abide. If the laws do not conform with the Constitution, then they can be declared void. The laws themselves are subject to international law and Belarus is willing to ""recognize the supremacy of the universally acknowledged principles of international law and ensure that its laws comply with such principles.""

The territory of Belarus is divided into discrete regions, called <a href="oblast">oblast</a>s. The oblasts are further divided into districts which are in turn subdivided into cities. The Constitution also allows for special regions to be created, which are to be controlled by legislation. Citizens of Belarus are also promised protection and sponsorship, regardless of whether they are inside Belarusian borders or in a foreign country. With some exceptions, <a href="stateless%20person">those who do not have a nationality</a> and foreigners are, under the Constitution, granted the same status and rights as citizens of Belarus. Belarus also has the power to grant <a href="Political%20asylum">asylum</a> to those who have been subject to persecution due to their ethnic background, political ideology or religious affiliation.

The Constitution also establishes <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> and Russian as the official languages of the country, pledges <a href="Neutral%20country">neutrality</a> and non-<a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a>, adopts national symbols, and establishes <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> as the capital (Minsk was previously the capital of the <a href="Belarusian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>).

Section Two describes rights the government grants to citizens. According to the document, providing and protecting these basic rights, which include the ""right to a dignified standard of living, including appropriate food, clothing, housing and likewise a continuous improvement of necessary living conditions"", is the top priority of the government. These rights are granted to all citizens of Belarus and every Belarusian is to be treated equally under Belarusian law. However, these rights can be removed for national security reasons or if Belarus is under a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a>. No one is allowed to ""enjoy advantages and privileges that are contrary to the law."" A state of emergency, which can be called by the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">President of Belarus</a> according to Article 84, has to be approved by the Council of the Republic within three days of its announcement, according to Article 98.

The Constitution provides that life is a right and that the government will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows for the <a href="Capital%20punishment">death penalty</a> to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted <a href="due%20process">due process</a> of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.

Section Three is divided into two chapters dealing with the organization and running of elections. The first chapter deals with the Belarusian electoral system and the second chapter details the organization of national <a href="referendum">referendum</a>s.

In Belarus, the right to vote in elections and <a href="plebiscite">plebiscite</a>s is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the <a href="voting%20right">voting right</a>s of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.

National referendums, or plebiscites, are elections whereby citizens can determine whether a specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, one of the following conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a> calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.

Section Four, which is divided into four chapters, outlines the functions of the <a href="Belarusian%20Government">Belarusian Government</a>, mainly the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">President</a> of the Republic of Belarus, the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Council of Ministers</a>, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Belarus">Parliament of Belarus</a> and the courts. Although elected by the Belarusian people, the president must not be a member of a political party when he or she assumes office. The Constitution also lists official duties for various posts, such as the president being the commander-in-chief of the <a href="Military%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian Armed Forces</a>. The section also describes procedures for situations where the president cannot continue duties or if the president dies in office.

Chapter Four lists the powers and duties of the Parliament of Belarus, which is called the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a>. The National Assembly itself is divided into two houses: the lower <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belarus">House of Representatives</a> and the upper <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Council of the Republic</a>. While each house has its own rules governing how members are elected, members decide on the various bills that could become Belarusian law and approve the nominations of cabinet heads that the president chooses.

The <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus</a>, headed by the <a href="List%20of%20Belarusian%20Prime%20Ministers">prime minister</a>, is the body of officials that are heads of various ministries of the Belarusian government. The president appoints each member of the council, but the National Assembly must also approve each member. Council members stays on until their term as a minister is over or the president has been replaced.

The <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus</a> is the highest court in Belarus. While other courts deal with civil or criminal issues, the Constitutional Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the government. The court has the power to declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the Constitutional Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional. The court that deals with criminal law matters is the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Court of Belarus</a>.

Section Five permits the formation of local governments. Local governments are selected by the local population and they have the power to administer local affairs, such as budgets, social services, and economic development. They also have the authority to collect taxes. The president can appoint and dismiss the heads of the local governments on the approval of the relevant local council of deputies.

Section Six lists the office and duties of the prosecutor general (Procurator General in the official translation) and the State Supervisory Committee. The prosecutor general and his appointed assistant prosecutors are tasked with the balanced implementation of national, regional and local laws on all sectors of government and public society. The prosecutor general is appointed by the president with permission from the Council of the Republic.

The State Supervisory Committee is tasked with monitoring the national budget, implementing the president's economic policy, and regulating the use of government property. As with the prosecutor general, the State Supervisory Committee is appointed by the president.

Section Seven specifies the <a href="fiscal%20policy">fiscal</a> responsibilities of Belarus. A national budget must be created, along with budgets for the local regions and cities. The money used in the national budget is acquired from national taxes and fines, and payments made to Belarus by foreign governments. At the end of a <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a>, the National Assembly must review the budget for the next fiscal year within five months. After the review and passing of the national budget, it is published for public viewing. Local budgets follow the same procedures. The <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Bank of the Republic of Belarus</a> is the state bank of Belarus and is the office responsible for issuing the national currency, the <a href="Belarusian%20ruble">Belarusian ruble</a>.

Section Eight describes processes for enforcing and amending the Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, therefore other laws and edicts cannot conflict with it. If a conflict occurs, the Constitution applies. If the Constitution is not in conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.

To amend the Constitution, one of two things must happen before the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a> can consider the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.

The ninth and last section of the Constitution was added following <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201996">passage of the 1996 revision of Constitution</a> and addresses laws passed before 1996. If the laws that were passed before the adoption of the Constitution are not in conflict with the Constitution, they are still enforced. All changes to the Constitution come into effect when formally issued by the president, unless specified otherwise. With the passage of the 1996 revision of the Constitution, the 1994 law "On the Procedure Governing the Entry into Force of the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus" ceased to be enforced. As a transitional measure, Section Nine states that the present (as of November 1996) leadership of Belarus can continue to serve until their term of service has been completed. When the Constitution is enforced, the national government is allowed to exercise their assigned duties. Unless otherwise stated in Article 143, Part 3, the national leadership must form state governmental bodies two months after the Constitution goes into effect.

After <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Lukashenko</a> assumed the presidency in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand the power of his office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201995">May 1995 national referendum</a> was the first step in the amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belarus">national flag</a> and <a href="Emblem%20of%20Belarus">national emblem</a>, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.

More calls for constitutional reform came in 1996. President Lukashenko unilaterally established the <a href="referendum">referendum</a> after the Supreme Soviet refused to support the measures or set up a date for the vote. An earlier attempt by the Supreme Soviet to establish their own referendum in September 1996 was struck down as "inconsistent with the Constitution" by the Constitutional Court. The referendum amended the Constitution mostly to strengthen the power of the presidency. Amongst the changes made were the following:

1- The <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Soviet</a>, the <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> parliament of Belarus, was abolished. The Supreme Soviet was replaced by the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a>, a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> parliament;

2- The term of President Alexander Lukashenko was extended from 1999 until 2001.

During the referendum, 84% of the approximately 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results not directly related to the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">CPSU</a> officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the <a href="Belarusian%20Popular%20Front">Belarusian Popular Front</a> pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.

The results of the 1996 referendum led to the exclusion of opposition parties from the new parliament. Due to problems associated with transparency and <a href="ballot%20stuffing">ballot stuffing</a>, the European Union, United States and several other nations do not recognize the results of the vote.

Along with choosing members for the National Assembly, Belarusian voters were presented with a referendum regarding presidential term limits. Before the vote, President <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> was only allowed to serve two terms before the Constitution required him to step down. The voter turnout for the referendum was nearly 90%, with 77.3% of the voters agreeing to eliminating term limits. The changes were implemented on October 17, 2004. Like the 1996 referendum, the validity of the vote was brought into question. According to the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE), many polling places went without independent observers. The OSCE believed that the standards of the vote did not meet OSCE requirements for "free and fair elections". Data from other <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>s (NGO) point out that 50% of voters did not participate in the referendum, so they contend that the results reported by the government are flawed. Two years later, Lukashenko ran in the 2006 election and won 83% of the vote during the first ballot. With no term limits, Lukashenko states that, depending on his health, he will not retire from politics and might run for re-election in 2011.

Both referendums were severely criticized by the political opposition inside Belarus as well as by international observers such as the OSCE. Observers state that both referendums were non-transparent and that the real results were not published. Observers were not allowed to see the process of counting ballots. Specifically, the democratic opposition to President Lukashenko decided to boycott the 1996 referendum on the Constitution. During the same election, international observers found problems with the voting process or found pro-government advertisements or notices at polling places. Opposition parties contend that the vote to dissolve the Supreme Soviet in 1996 removed Belarus' last democratically elected parliament and installed Lukashenko's hand picked parliament. Despite the claims of manipulation of the elections and the Constitution itself, there are a few parts of the current constitution approved by key leaders of the Belarusian democratic opposition. In a 2005 interview with <a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe">Radio Free Europe</a>, presidential candidate <a href="Alaksandar%20Milinkievi%C4%8D">Alaksandar Milinkievič</a> stated that Belarus' stance as a neutral country, stated in Article 18, should be preserved with regard to joining NATO and the European Union. Legal interpretation of the Constitution is also brought into question. In a 1998 journal, the <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> School of Law noted that Belarusian legal scholars came up with a new theory to deal with jurisprudence. Laws are constitutional if they follow the will of President Lukashenko and the people; unconstitutional if the president and the people do not like it. The laws that fall in the latter category are considered "ignored" by the legal scholars. In June 1999, a Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers from the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> visited Belarus and noted inconsistency between national laws, decrees and the Constitution. The UN <a href="rapporteur">rapporteur</a>, <a href="Dato%20Param%20Cumaraswamy">Dato Param Cumaraswamy</a>, especially noted that temporary decrees issued by the national authorities are still in force, even if they had expired or contradict the Constitution.

Gropecunt Lane

Gropecunt Lane was a <a href="street%20name">street name</a> found in English towns and cities during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, believed to be a reference to the prostitution centred on those areas; it was normal practice for a medieval street name to reflect the street's function or the economic activity taking place within it. Gropecunt, the earliest known use of which is in about 1230, appears to have been derived as a compound of the words "<a href="Groping">grope</a>" and "<a href="cunt">cunt</a>". Streets with that name were often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities, and at least one appears to have been an important thoroughfare.

Although the name was once common throughout England, changes in attitude resulted in its replacement by more innocuous versions such as Grape Lane. A variation of Gropecunt was last recorded as a street name in 1561.

Variations include Gropecunte, Gropecountelane, Gropecontelane, Groppecountelane and Gropekuntelane. There were once many such street names in England, but all have now been <a href="Expurgation">bowdlerised</a>. In the city of <a href="York">York</a>, for instance, Grapcunt Lane—"grāp" is the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word for grope—was renamed as the more acceptable <a href="Snickelways%20of%20York">Grape Lane</a>.

The first record of the word "grope" being used in the indecent sense of sexual touching appears in 1380; "cunt" has been used to describe the <a href="vulva">vulva</a> since at least 1230, and corresponds to the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "kunta", although its precise <a href="etymology">etymology</a> is uncertain.

Under its entry for the word "cunt", the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" reports that a street was listed as Gropecuntlane in about 1230, the first appearance of that name. According to author Angus McIntyre, organised prostitution was well established in London by the middle of the 12th century, initially mainly confined to <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> in the southeast, but later spreading to other areas such as <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a>, <a href="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>, <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, and <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. The practice was often tolerated by the authorities, and there are many historical examples of it being dealt with by regulation rather than by censure: in 1393 the authorities in London allowed prostitutes to work only in Cokkes Lane (now known as <a href="Cock%20Lane">Cock Lane</a>) and in 1285 French prostitutes in <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a> were confined to a single street.

It was normal practice for <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> street names to reflect their function, or the economic activity taking place within them (especially the commodities available for sale), hence the frequency of names such as <a href="The%20Shambles">The Shambles</a>, Silver Street, Fish Street, and Swinegate (pork butchers) in cities with a medieval history. Prostitution may well have been a normal aspect of medieval <a href="Urban%20culture">urban</a> life; in <a href="John%20Stow">John Stow</a> describes Love Lane as "so called of Wantons". The more graphic Gropecunt Lane, however, is possibly the most obvious allusion to sexual activity.

The "Oxford English Dictionary" defines the word "cunt" as "The female external genital organs" and notes "Its currency is restricted in the manner of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v. FUCK v." During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> the word may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13th century. In "<a href="The%20Miller%27s%20Tale">The Miller's Tale</a>", <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> writes "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" (and intimately he caught her by her crotch), and "Philotus" (1603) mentions "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to be today. In John Garfield's "Wandring Whore II" (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a <a href="whore">whore</a>—"this is none of your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C— but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards". <a href="Francis%20Grose">Francis Grose</a>'s "A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue" (1785) lists the word as "C**t. The "chonnos" of the Greek, and the "cunnus" of the Latin dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: "un con Miege"."

Although some medieval street names such as Addle Street (stinking urine, or other liquid filth; mire) and Fetter Lane (once Fewterer, meaning "idle and disorderly person") have survived, others have been changed in deference to contemporary attitudes. Sherborne Lane in London was in 1272–73 known as Shitteborwelane, later Shite-burn lane and Shite-buruelane (possibly due to nearby <a href="cesspit">cesspit</a>s). Pissing Alley, one of several identically named streets whose names survived the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a>, was called Little Friday Street in 1848, before being absorbed into <a href="Cannon%20Street">Cannon Street</a> in 1853–54. Petticoat Lane, the meaning of which is sometimes misinterpreted as related to prostitution, was in 1830 renamed as Middlesex Street, following complaints about the street being named after an item of <a href="underwear">underwear</a>. More recently, Rillington Place, where <a href="John%20Christie%20%28murderer%29">John Christie</a> murdered his victims, was renamed Ruston Close. Selous Street in London was renamed as a mark of respect for <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, as it may have been perceived to have been named in honour of the colonialist <a href="Frederick%20Selous">Frederick Selous</a>, although it was actually named after the artist <a href="Henry%20Courtney%20Selous">Henry Courtney Selous</a>.

As the most ubiquitous and explicit example of such street names, with the exception of <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> and possibly <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> (where a Grapecuntlane was mentioned in 1588) the use of Gropecunt seems to have fallen out of favour by the 14th century. Its steady disappearance from the English vernacular may have been the result of a gradual cleaning-up of the name; Gropecuntelane in 13th-century <a href="Wells%2C%20Somerset">Wells</a> became Grope Lane, and then in the 19th century, Grove Lane. The ruling <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant</a> conservative elite's growing hostility to prostitution during the 16th century resulted in the closure of the Southwark <a href="Brothel">stews</a> in 1546, replacing earlier attempts at regulation.

London had several streets named Gropecunt Lane including one in the parishes of <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20Soper%20Lane">St Pancras, Soper Lane</a> and <a href="St%20Mary%20Colechurch">St Mary Colechurch</a>, between Bordhawelane (<a href="bordello">bordello</a>) and Puppekirty Lane (poke skirt) near present-day <a href="Cheapside">Cheapside</a>. First recorded in 1279 as Gropecontelane and Groppecountelane, it was part of a collection of streets which appears to have survived as a small island of prostitution outside Southwark, where such activities were normally confined during the medieval period.

The name was also used in other large medieval towns across England, including <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="York">York</a>, <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>, and <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>'s Gropekuntelane (now Opie Street) was recorded in Latin as "turpis vicus", the shameful street. In 1230 Oxford's <a href="Magpie%20Lane%2C%20Oxford">Magpie Lane</a> was known as Gropecunt Lane, renamed Grope or Grape Lane in the 13th century, and then Magpie Lane in the mid-17th century. It was again renamed in 1850 as Grove Street, before once again assuming the name Magpie Lane in the 20th century. Newcastle and Worcester each had a Grope Lane close to their public <a href="quay">quay</a>s. In their 2001 study of medieval prostitution, using the "Historic Towns Atlas" as a source, historian Richard Holt and <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a> Nigel Baker of the University of Birmingham studied sexually suggestive street names around England. They concluded that there was a close association between a street with the name Gropecunt Lane, which was almost always in the centre of town, and that town's principal market-place or high street. This correlation suggests that these streets not only provided for the sexual gratification of local men, but also for visiting stall-holders.

Such trade may explain the relative uniformity of the name across the country. Streets named Gropecunt Lane are recorded in several smaller market towns such as <a href="Banbury">Banbury</a>, <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> and <a href="Wells%2C%20Somerset">Wells</a>, where a street of that name existed in 1300, regularly mentioned in legal documents of the time. Parsons Street in Banbury was first recorded as Gropecunt Lane in 1333, and may have been an important thoroughfare, but by 1410 its name had been changed to Parsons Lane. Grape Lane in <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a> may once have been Grope Lane, or Grapcunt Lane. Gropecunte Lane in Glastonbury, later known as Grope lane, now St Benedicts Court, was recorded in 1290 and 1425 A street called Grope Countelane existed in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> as recently as 1561, connecting the town's two principal marketplaces. At some date unrecorded the street was renamed Grope Lane, a name it has retained. In Thomas Phillips' "History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury" (1799) the author is explicit in his understanding of the origin of the name as a place of "scandalous lewdness and venery", but Archdeacon Hugh Owen's "Some account of the ancient and present state of Shrewsbury" (1808) describes it as "called Grope, or the Dark Lane". As a result of these differing accounts, some local tour guides attribute the name to "feeling one's way along a dark and narrow thoroughfare".

Eve Russell

Eve Russell is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> on the American <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Passions">Passions</a>", which aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> from 1999 to 2007 and on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> in 2007–08. Created by the soap's <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a>, <a href="James%20E.%20Reilly">James E. Reilly</a>, Eve was played by <a href="Tracey%20Ross">Tracey Ross</a> for the series' entire run. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and <a href="Kimberly%20Kevon%20Williams">Kimberly Kevon Williams</a> played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross was initially hesitant to audition for the role following her negative experience on "<a href="Ryan%27s%20Hope">Ryan's Hope</a>", but was attracted to the show after learning about its supernatural and fantasy elements. Her casting was part of NBC's attempt to include a racially diverse ensemble on daytime television. She based her performance on <a href="Joanne%20Woodward">Joanne Woodward</a>'s role in the 1957 film "<a href="The%20Three%20Faces%20of%20Eve">The Three Faces of Eve</a>" and Catherine Halsey from <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>'s 1943 novel, "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>".

Eve, part of "Passions" <a href="Russell%20family%20%28Passions%29">Russell family</a>, is introduced as the perfect wife of <a href="T.%20C.%20Russell">T. C. Russell</a> and mother of <a href="Whitney%20Russell">Whitney</a> and <a href="Simone%20Russell">Simone</a>. Eve's desperation to conceal all evidence of her past relationship—and child—with <a href="Julian%20Crane">Julian Crane</a> leads to the breakup of her marriage and family, especially when her adoptive sister <a href="Liz%20Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a> arrives in the fictional <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern</a> town of Harmony and ruins Eve's life for abandoning her first family. Later storylines focus on Eve's on-again, off-again relationship with Julian and her search for their son, who is revealed as <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a> despite long-running speculation by the show's characters and <a href="List%20of%20soap%20opera%20media%20outlets">media outlets</a> that he was <a href="Chad%20Harris-Crane">Chad Harris-Crane</a>. Ross and Johnson made cameo appearances as Eve and T. C. in the series finale of the NBC primetime drama <a href="Providence%20%28TV%20series%29">"Providence"</a>. At the end of the show, several props and costumes related to Eve were sold in an auction, along with other items from the show.

Critics and fans praised Ross' performance, although the character's later storylines were criticized by the cast. Eve and Julian, known by fans as "Evian", were dubbed "the Odd Couple of "Passions"" by "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Weekly">Soap Opera Weekly</a>", and critics reacted positively to the actors' chemistry. Ross felt that Eve's relationship with Julian showcased an authentic representation of an interracial couple. She received eight nominations for the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Daytime%20Drama%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series</a>, winning at the <a href="38th%20NAACP%20Image%20Awards">38th NAACP Image Awards</a>.

Tracey Ross was originally hesitant to audition for another soap opera after her stint as Diana Douglas on "<a href="Ryan%27s%20Hope">Ryan's Hope</a>" from 1985 to 1987, which she compared to "working in a morgue" because the show was constantly threatened with cancellation. She initially rejected the offer to play Eve Russell, but she was repeatedly contacted by NBC about the role over several months before her agent convinced her to audition for "Passions"' casting director Jackie Briskey. Ross said later that she did not realize that "Passions" was supposed to be "wacky" until the character <a href="Grace%20Bennett">Grace Bennett</a> floated out of her bedroom window. Based on the first week's scripts, she described "Passions" as "my kind of show" owing to the supernatural and fantasy elements. Ross played the role from the series debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and <a href="Kimberly%20Kevon%20Williams">Kimberly Kevon Williams</a> played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross described "Passions" as the opposite of "Ryan's Hope"; "Passions", she felt, was "the spring of a soap opera" because of the cast and crew's excitement about future storylines, while "Ryan's Hope" was "the winter of one" due to the fear of cancellation. 

<a href="Sheraton%20Kalouria">Sheraton Kalouria</a>, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, said that the show's racially diverse ensemble, as represented by the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds, exemplified "truly color-blind storytelling". Ross believed that Eve was not defined by identity as an African American: "If they wanted to make my character any other ethnicity they wouldn't have to change a thing about her... She's just a person." The actress cited the show's racial diversity as a primary reason for her attraction to the role. She stated that she felt "tremendous support from NBC and "Passions" that the black characters and/or Hispanic characters are all essential parts of the story". She has cited Eve as helping to expand the TV representation of African Americans and interracial relationships.

The soap opera's official website stated that Eve was the "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" who was enjoying a successful career; she was described as an altruist by John Berlau of <a href="The%20Atlas%20Society">The Atlas Society</a>. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to "getting a jail sentence and you're expected to go along with it without any explanation" or "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a> "<a href="The%20Banger%20Sisters">The Banger Sisters</a>".

In an interview with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>'s <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">objectivist philosophy</a>. She said that Eve was "always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you might be willing to make." She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>", particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an <a href="Individualism">individualist</a>. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a> played by <a href="Joanne%20Woodward">Joanne Woodward</a> in the 1957 film "<a href="The%20Three%20Faces%20of%20Eve">The Three Faces of Eve</a>". The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better understand how to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel "<a href="Hidden%20Passions">Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox</a>" to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was "a real short courtship" that turned the character from "the innocent girl to the woman on the <a href="Studio%2054">Studio 54</a> dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as "more immediate, wild[,] and impulsive" and "very untamed and unrestrained".

Early in the show, the actress based her understanding of Eve on the character's relationships with Grace and <a href="Ivy%20Winthrop">Ivy Winthrop</a>. Ross described Eve's love for Grace as "my rock in the sea" when Eve took extreme, illegal measures to hide her past. <a href="Kim%20Johnston%20Ulrich">Kim Johnston Ulrich</a>, who portrayed Ivy, felt that her character viewed Eve as her only friend. Ross added that Eve respected Ivy's "ability to take charge" instead of "always tiptoeing around and walking on eggshells". She understood Ivy's schemes to blackmail Eve as an attempt at a deeper connection; as "the closest thing to a friend that Ivy had", Eve interpreted their relationship as a desire for friendship.

Ross described Eve's relationship with <a href="Julian%20Crane">Julian Crane</a> as an authentic representation of an interracial couple. She felt Eve was written as a fully realized person with her own story, rather than as a "walking, living philosophical statement" about race relations. Ross praised "the people who laid the groundwork for [her]" and allowed characters to be played other than "in a minstrel-like way", similar to <a href="Ellen%20DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> paving the way for "<a href="Will%20%26amp%3B%20Grace">Will & Grace</a>". Ross and <a href="Amelia%20Marshall">Amelia Marshall</a>, who played Eve's adoptive sister <a href="Liz%20Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a>, believed that the relationship emphasized a difference in social classes rather than races. Initially, Ross felt intimidated by playing a part of a supercouple, saying "[i]t means so much to me that I want to do it justice", but following the show's cancelation, she identified it as her favorite storyline. She went on to equate the Julian and Eve's love story to that of Romeo and Juliet. "My Baby's Gone", a song that Eve frequently performs on the show during flashbacks, was used to symbolize Eve's relationship with Julian. Ross recorded the vocals for it, as well as four other songs, without the aid of <a href="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a>. "Passions" was Ross' first singing role. When asked by a fan about her experiences singing on the show, Ross said she worked with a vocal coach, and described her sound as "sincere, soft, [and] non-grating".

"Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox" identifies Eve Russell as the only child of "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". The series changed Eve's family, identifying her parents as Warren Johnson and Ruby Lincoln (a poor couple from the American South) and introducing Mr. Sanbourne as her stepfather and Liz Sanbourne as her adoptive sister. As a teenager, Eve runs away to Boston to pursue a career as a jazz singer; there, she meets Julian Crane and becomes involved with alcohol, drugs and prostitution. She also becomes close friends with fellow jazz singer <a href="Minor%20Passions%20characters%23Crystal%20Harris">Crystal Harris</a>. During this period, she accidentally hits her future husband <a href="T.%20C.%20Russell">T. C. Russell</a> while <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a>, ruining his tennis career. T. C., unaware that Eve is responsible for the accident, believes that Julian was driving. Eve and Julian separate after she learns that she is pregnant; Julian's marriage to the daughter of former Governor <a href="Crane%20family%23Extended%20family">Harrison Winthrop</a>, Ivy, is arranged by his father <a href="Alistair%20Crane">Alistair</a>. Crystal, the only person Eve tells about her pregnancy, helps deliver her son.

Although Eve initially believes that her baby died, she learns that he survived when she discovers <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a> in 2007. "Hidden Passions" identifies Vincent as born on <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a>. The book states that Alistair arranged for Vincent's death, but the <a href="Contract%20killing">hitman</a> Jack placed the baby into <a href="social%20services">social services</a> without Alistair's knowledge. The series changed Alistair's involvement in Vincent's life; instead, Alistair abuses and manipulates Vincent as a tool for his plans to maintain power over Harmony. For most of the series, Eve and Julian's child is believed to be <a href="Chad%20Harris-Crane">Chad Harris-Crane</a>, who is later shown to be Liz's child from her rape by Alistair. After the apparent death of her child, Eve leaves Boston and gives up music to attend medical school. Alistair sends her money (which she uses to pay her tuition) to keep quiet about her relationship—and child—with Julian. Eve eventually moves to Harmony and becomes a respected physician at Harmony Hospital. She marries T. C. and has two children, <a href="Whitney%20Russell">Whitney</a> and <a href="Simone%20Russell">Simone</a>.

Eve's early storylines focus on her attempt to keep her past hidden from her family and her neighbors in Harmony. Ivy Winthrop unearths proof of Eve's relationship with Julian, and blackmails her into breaking up Grace Bennett's marriage with <a href="Sam%20Bennett%20%28Passions%29">Sam Bennett</a>. In 2002, Liz arrives in Harmony to seek revenge on her sister, who left her in an abusive household, but Eve keeps Liz's identity as her adoptive sister a secret from her family and the town. In a 2002–2004 storyline, Eve relies more on Julian as Liz attempts to expose her and seduce her husband. Eve works with Julian to find their child. Overwhelmed by Liz's desire for vengeance and the search for her child, Eve is unaware of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The storyline culminates in July 2004, when Liz brings Eve's aunt <a href="Russell%20family%20%28Passions%29%23Irma%20Johnson">Irma Johnson</a> to tell T. C. the truth about her relationship with Julian and their child. Whitney turns against her mother, incorrectly assuming that her child with Julian is Chad (making her relationship with him incestuous). T. C. divorces Eve, unable to forgive her lies about her past with Julian and her pregnancy, and begins a romantic relationship with Liz. Eve and Julian renew their relationship, despite his wife <a href="Rebecca%20Hotchkiss">Rebecca Hotchkiss</a>' refusal to grant him a divorce.

In 2005, Liz drinks poisoned punch which Rebecca had intended for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately giving her the punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. During the arrest and trial, Eve and Julian grow closer together and T. C. ends his relationship with Liz to reconcile with his ex-wife. Julian makes a deal with Rebecca that he would give her anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison; the judge declares a <a href="Trial%23Mistrials">mistrial</a>. The plot then focuses on Eve's love triangle with T. C. and Julian as she is torn between taking care of T. C. after his <a href="stroke">stroke</a> and accepting Julian's proposal of marriage. Eve discovers Julian's affair with Valerie Davis, an employee of <a href="Crane%20family%23Crane%20Industries">Crane Industries</a>, leading to her decision to nurse T. C. back to health and renew their relationship to reunite their family. Julian later explains to Eve that he was paying Valerie to search for their son; Eve forgives Valerie, and she and Julian continue their search. In 2007, Eve and Julian discover that Vincent Clarkson (a blackmailer who raped and murdered several people) is their son, and try to support him despite his criminal past. However, Eve cannot accept her son's criminality and <a href="incest">incest</a>uous, <a href="Adultery">adulterous</a> affair with Chad Harris-Crane (Vincent's uncle, adoptive cousin and brother-in-law) and begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Her career and reputation suffer, and she has a breakdown after Vincent's apparent death on August 30, 2007. In the show's final NBC episode on September 7, 2007, Vincent is revealed as <a href="intersex">intersex</a>; he separates his identity into Vincent and Valerie, an indication of <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a>.

After the show's transition from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens to kill her if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she <a href="relapse">relapse</a>s, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, <a href="Viki%20Chatsworth">Viki Chatsworth</a>, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of <a href="Luis%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald</a> and <a href="Fancy%20Crane">Fancy Crane</a>, <a href="Noah%20Bennett">Noah Bennett</a> and <a href="Paloma%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and <a href="Kay%20Bennett">Kay Bennett</a>, and <a href="Minor%20Passions%20characters%23Edna%20Wallace">Edna Wallace</a> and <a href="Minor%20Passions%20characters%23Norma%20Bates">Norma Bates</a>, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch <a href="Tabitha%20Lenox">Tabitha Lenox</a> renounces magic and becomes a <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born-again Christian</a>. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.

Tracey Ross and Rodney Van Johnson made cameo appearances as Eve and T. C. Russell in the series finale of the NBC primetime drama, "<a href="Providence%20%28TV%20series%29">Providence</a>", one of the first daytime-primetime <a href="Fictional%20crossover">crossovers</a>. After DirecTV's decision to cancel the show, "Passions" joined Premiere Props in a public, two-day estate sale of props and costumes from the series. The auction gave fans "an opportunity to own a piece of their favorite show". Several Eve-related items were offered for sale, including a medical coat splattered with blood from her botched surgery on Julian and a framed copy of her <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">medical</a> degree.

Eve's character and storylines initially elicited a positive response from "Passions"' cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of "a full African American family" on daytime television with serious storylines, not "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said the chance to work with Tracey Ross, who he called the <a href="it%20girl">it girl</a> for the African American community following her appearance on "<a href="Star%20Search">Star Search</a>", influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: "[i]t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where you need to go and not be afraid."

Cast members were more critical of Eve's later appearances on the show. Ross reacted negatively to Eve's involvement in Vincent's storylines. She said that Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her "physically nauseous" and she could only complete the birth scenes after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of "[their] comedic possibilities". Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star <a href="McKenzie%20Westmore">McKenzie Westmore</a>. Westmore cited it as a reason for the show's cancellation, saying, "This has got to be the worst storyline "ever" done, what are they doing?".

Eve Russell has been widely praised by television critics and viewers. Ross was frequently rated as fans' favorite "Passions" actress in "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Digest">Soap Opera Digest</a>" polls for her portrayal of the character. She was listed as number eight of the top-ten most beautiful soap actresses by "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", who called her the show's most talented actress. At the time of his 2006 interview with Ross, Berlau identified Eve as one of the most popular characters on daytime television. Published in "<a href="The%20Free%20Lance%E2%80%93Star">The Free Lance–Star</a>"s section requesting fans' story ideas for "Passions", a viewer called the rivalry between Eve and Ivy the "best I've seen on daytime TV".

Critical response to Eve and Julian's relationship was largely positive. Eve and Julian were included in "TV Guide"'s list of best soap opera <a href="supercouple">supercouple</a>s due to the chemistry between Ross and Masters, and they were referenced as "the Odd Couple of "Passions"" by "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Weekly">Soap Opera Weekly</a>". Fans reacted positively to the characters' relationship, and dubbed the couple the <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> "Evian". According to Ross, the soap opera did not receive any negative criticism from its focus on an interracial couple. In an earlier interview with "Soap Opera Weekly", Ross believed that neither the show's emphasis on Eve and Julian as a couple, nor a hypothetical situation in which she initiated a real-life relationship with Julian's actor, Ben Masters, would attract racist criticism. Despite the positive reception of the couple, Soapdom.com's Lesleyann Coker felt that the romance led to a regression in Julian's character. Coker argued that Eve turned Julian into a "harmless, gentle, lost soul", and preferred the times when Julian was a "drinking, cheating louse" instead.

The role of Eve earned Ross several award nominations, and she was praised for her representation of an African American character on daytime television. Ross received eight nominations for the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Daytime%20Drama%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series</a> and won at the <a href="38th%20NAACP%20Image%20Awards">38th NAACP Image Awards</a>. A writer from "<a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">Jet</a>" described each member of the Russell family (including Eve) as being an "integral part of the show" rather than <a href="Tokenism">token characters</a>.

Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916

The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 were a series of <a href="shark%20attack">shark attack</a>s along the coast of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, between July 1 and 12, 1916, in which four people were killed and one injured. Since 1916, scholars have debated which shark species was responsible and the number of animals involved, with the <a href="great%20white%20shark">great white shark</a> and the <a href="bull%20shark">bull shark</a> most frequently cited. The incidents occurred during a deadly summer <a href="heat%20wave">heat wave</a> and <a href="Poliomyelitis">polio</a> epidemic in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> that drove thousands of people to the seaside <a href="resort">resort</a>s of the <a href="Jersey%20Shore">Jersey Shore</a>.

Personal and national reaction to the fatalities involved a wave of panic that led to shark hunts aimed at eradicating the population of "man-eating" sharks and protecting the economies of New Jersey's seaside communities. Resort towns enclosed their public beaches with steel nets to protect swimmers. Scientific knowledge about sharks before 1916 was based on conjecture and speculation. The attacks forced <a href="Ichthyology">ichthyologist</a>s to reassess common beliefs about the abilities of sharks and the nature of shark attacks.

The Jersey Shore attacks immediately entered into American popular culture, where sharks became <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s in <a href="editorial%20cartoon">editorial cartoon</a>s representing danger. The attacks became the subject of documentaries for the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a>, <a href="National%20Geographic%20Channel">National Geographic Channel</a>, and <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a>, which aired "<a href="12%20Days%20of%20Terror">12 Days of Terror</a>" (2004) and the <a href="Shark%20Week">Shark Week</a> episode "<a href="Blood%20in%20the%20Water%20%28film%29">Blood in the Water</a>" (2009).

Between July 1 and 12, 1916, five people were attacked along the coast of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at <a href="Beach%20Haven%2C%20New%20Jersey">Beach Haven</a>, a resort town established on <a href="Long%20Beach%20Island">Long Beach Island</a> off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> was on vacation at the <a href="Engleside%20Hotel">Engleside Hotel</a> with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay%20Retriever">Chesapeake Bay Retriever</a> that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by <a href="lifeguard">lifeguard</a> Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he <a href="Exsanguination">bled to death</a> on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45 p.m.

Despite the Vansant attack, beaches along the Jersey Shore remained open. Sightings of large sharks swarming off the coast of New Jersey were reported by sea captains entering the ports of <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> but were dismissed. The second major attack occurred 45 miles (72 km) north of Beach Haven at the resort town of <a href="Spring%20Lake%2C%20New%20Jersey">Spring Lake, New Jersey</a>. The victim was Charles Bruder, 27, a <a href="Swiss%20%28people%29">Swiss</a> bell captain at the Essex & Sussex Hotel. Bruder was killed on Thursday, July 6, 1916, while swimming 130 yards (120 m) from shore. A shark bit him in the abdomen and severed his legs; Bruder's blood turned the water red. After hearing screams, a woman notified two lifeguards that a canoe with a red <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> had capsized and was floating just at the water's surface. Lifeguards Chris Anderson and George White rowed to Bruder in a lifeboat and realized he had been bitten by a shark. They pulled him from the water, but he bled to death on the way to shore. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "women [were] panic-stricken [and fainted] as [Bruder's] mutilated body ... [was] brought ashore." Guests and workers at the Essex & Sussex and neighboring hotels raised money for Bruder's mother in Switzerland.

The next two major attacks took place in <a href="Matawan%20Creek">Matawan Creek</a> near the town of <a href="Keyport%2C%20New%20Jersey">Keyport</a> on Wednesday, July 12. Located 30 miles (48 km) north of Spring Lake and inland of Raritan Bay, Matawan resembled a <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern</a> town rather than an Atlantic beach resort. Matawan's location made it an unlikely site for interactions between sharks and humans. When Thomas Cottrell, a sea captain and Matawan resident, spotted an 8 ft (2.40m) long shark in the creek, the town dismissed him. Around 2:00 p.m. a group of local boys, including young Lester Stilwell, 11, and were playing in the creek together. One of the boys had brought along their pet dog, which was swimming with them as well. At an area called "Wyckoff Dock" they saw what appeared to be an "old, black weather-beaten board or a weathered log." A <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> appeared in the water and the boys realized it was a shark. Before Stilwell could climb from the creek, the shark pulled him underwater.

The boys ran to town for help, and several men, including local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher, 24, came to investigate. Fisher and others dived into the creek to find Stilwell, believing him to have suffered a seizure. After locating the boy's body and attempting to return to shore, Fisher was also bitten by the shark in front of the townspeople, losing Stilwell in the process. His right thigh was severely injured and he bled to death at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in <a href="Long%20Branch%2C%20New%20Jersey">Long Branch</a> at 5:30 p.m. Stilwell's body was recovered 150 feet (46 m) upstream from the Wyckoff dock on July 14.

The fifth and final victim, Joseph Dunn, 14, of New York City was attacked a half-mile from the Wyckoff dock nearly 30 minutes after the fatal attacks on Stilwell and Fisher. The shark bit his left leg, but Dunn was rescued by his brother and friend after a vicious tug-of-war battle with the shark. Joseph Dunn was taken to <a href="Saint%20Peter%27s%20University%20Hospital">Saint Peter's University Hospital</a> in <a href="New%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey">New Brunswick</a>; he recovered from the bite and was released on September 15, 1916.

As the national media descended on Beach Haven, Spring Lake, and Matawan, the Jersey Shore attacks started a shark panic. According to Capuzzo, this panic was "unrivaled in American history," "sweeping along the coasts of New York and New Jersey and spreading by telephone and <a href="Wireless%20telegraphy">wireless</a>, letter and postcard." At first, after the Beach Haven incident, scientists and the press reluctantly blamed the death of Charles Vansant on a shark. "The New York Times" reported that Vansant "was badly bitten in the surf ... by a fish, presumably a shark." Still, <a href="Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission">State Fish Commissioner</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and former director of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Aquarium">Philadelphia Aquarium</a> James M. Meehan asserted in the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Public%20Ledger">Philadelphia Public Ledger</a>" that the shark was preying on the dog, but bit Vansant by mistake. He specifically de-emphasized the threat sharks posed to humans:

The media's response to the second attack was more sensational. Major American newspapers such as the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>", "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>", "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" placed the story on the front page. "The New York Times"' headline read, "Shark Kills Bather Off Jersey Beach". The growing panic had cost New Jersey resort owners an estimated $250,000 ($ in ) in lost tourism, and sun bathing had declined by 75 percent in some areas. A press conference was convened on July 8, 1916, at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> with scientists <a href="Frederic%20Augustus%20Lucas">Frederic Augustus Lucas</a>, <a href="John%20Treadwell%20Nichols">John Treadwell Nichols</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Cushman%20Murphy">Robert Cushman Murphy</a> as panelists. To calm the growing panic, the three men stressed that a third run in with a shark was unlikely, although they were admittedly surprised that sharks bit anyone at all. Nevertheless, Nichols—the only <a href="Ichthyology">ichthyologist</a> in the trio—warned swimmers to stay close to shore and to take advantage of the netted bathing areas installed at public beaches after the first attack.

Shark sightings increased along the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20States">Mid-Atlantic Coast</a> following the attacks. On July 8, armed motorboats patrolling the beach at Spring Creek chased an animal they thought to be a shark, and <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park</a>'s Asbury Avenue Beach was closed after lifeguard Benjamin Everingham claimed to have beaten off a long shark with an oar. Sharks were spotted near <a href="Bayonne%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bayonne, New Jersey</a>; <a href="Rocky%20Point%2C%20New%20York">Rocky Point, New York</a>; <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>; <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>; and <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, and a columnist from "<a href="Field%20%26amp%3B%20Stream">Field & Stream</a>" captured a <a href="sandbar%20shark">sandbar shark</a> in the surf at Beach Haven. Actress <a href="Gertrude%20Hoffmann%20%28actress%29">Gertrude Hoffmann</a> was swimming at the <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> beach shortly after the Matawan fatalities when she claimed to have encountered a shark. "The New York Times" noted that Hoffman "had the presence of mind to remember that she had read in the "Times" that a bather can scare away a shark by splashing, and she beat up the water furiously." Hoffman was certain she was going to be devoured by the "Jersey man-eater", but later admitted she was "not sure ... whether she had her trouble for nothing or had barely escaped death."

Local New Jersey governments made efforts to protect bathers and the economy from man-eating sharks. The Fourth Avenue Beach at Asbury Park was enclosed with a <a href="steel">steel</a>-wire-<a href="mesh">mesh</a> fence and patrolled by armed motorboats; it remained the only beach open following the Everingham incident. After the attacks on Stilwell, Fisher, and Dunn, residents of Matawan lined Matawan Creek with nets and detonated <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a> in an attempt to catch and kill the shark. Matawan mayor Arris B. Henderson ordered the "Matawan Journal" to print wanted posters offering a $100 reward ($ in dollars) to anyone killing a shark in the creek. Despite the town's efforts, no sharks were captured or killed in Matawan Creek. The "Matawan Journal" reported the shark account incident in the front page of its July 13, 1916 issue with another article about the capture of a shark in Keyport a neighboring town in the issue of July 20, 1916.

Resort communities along the Jersey Shore petitioned the federal government to aid local efforts to protect beaches and hunt sharks. The <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> appropriated $5,000 ($ in dollars) for eradicating the New Jersey shark threat, and <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> scheduled a meeting with his <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">Cabinet</a> to discuss the fatal attacks. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury secretary</a> <a href="William%20Gibbs%20McAdoo">William Gibbs McAdoo</a> suggested that the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> be mobilized to patrol the Jersey Shore and protect sun bathers. Shark hunts ensued across the coasts of New Jersey and New York; as the "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Constitution</a>" reported on July 14, "Armed shark hunters in motor boats patrolled the New York and New Jersey coasts today while others lined the beaches in a concerted effort to exterminate the man-eaters ..." New Jersey <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">governor</a> <a href="James%20Fairman%20Fielder">James Fairman Fielder</a> and local municipalities offered bounties to individuals hunting sharks. Hundreds of sharks were captured on the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> as a result of the attacks. The East Coast shark hunt is described as "the largest scale animal hunt in history."

After the second incident, scientists and the public presented theories to explain which species of shark was responsible for the Jersey Shore attacks or whether multiple sharks were involved. Lucas and Nichols proposed that a northward-swimming <a href="wikt%3Arogue">rogue</a> shark was responsible. They believed it would eventually arrive along New York's coast: "Unless the shark came through the <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">Harbor</a> and went through the north through <a href="Hell%20Gate">Hell Gate</a> and <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, it was presumed it would swim along the <a href="South%20Shore%20%28Long%20Island%29">South Shore</a> of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> and the first deep water <a href="inlet">inlet</a> it reaches will be the <a href="Jamaica%20Bay">Jamaica Bay</a>."

Witnesses of the Beach Haven fatality estimated that the shark was long. A sea captain who saw the event believed it was a <a href="Grey%20nurse%20shark">Spanish shark</a> driven from the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> decades earlier by bombings during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. Several fishermen claimed to have caught the "Jersey man-eater" in the days following the attacks. A <a href="blue%20shark">blue shark</a> was captured on July 14 near Long Branch, and four days later the same Thomas Cottrell who had seen the shark in Matawan Creek claimed to have captured a <a href="sandbar%20shark">sandbar shark</a> with a <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a> near the mouth of the creek.

On July 14, <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> <a href="Taxidermy">taxidermist</a> and <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus">Barnum and Bailey</a> <a href="Lion%20taming">lion tamer</a> Michael Schleisser caught a 7.5 foot (2.3 m), 325 pound (147 kg) shark while fishing in <a href="Raritan%20Bay">Raritan Bay</a> only a few miles from the mouth of Matawan Creek. The shark nearly sank the boat before Schleisser killed it with a broken oar. When he opened the shark's belly, he removed a "suspicious fleshy material and bones" that took up "about two-thirds of a milk crate" and "together weighed fifteen pounds." Scientists identified the shark as a young great white and the ingested remains as human. Schleisser mounted the shark and placed it on display in the window of a <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> shop on <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> but it was later lost. The only surviving photograph appeared in the "Bronx Home News".

No further attacks were reported along the Jersey Shore in the summer of 1916 after the capture of Schleisser's shark. Murphy and Lucas declared the great white to be the "Jersey man-eater". Skeptical individuals, however, offered alternative hypotheses. In a letter to "The New York Times", Barrett P. Smith of <a href="Sound%20Beach%2C%20New%20York">Sound Beach, New York</a> wrote:

Another letter to "The New York Times" blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, "These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed <a href="Ocean%20liner">liners</a> to this coast, or even followed the "<a href="Deutschland%20%281916%29">Deutschland</a>" herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children." The writer concluded, "This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh." 

Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that "there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks," and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, <a href="Thomas%20B.%20Allen%20%28author%29">Thomas B. Allen</a>, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> reported in 2002 that "some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These people say the real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for "Jaws"—may be the lesser known <a href="bull%20shark">bull shark</a>."

Biologists George A. Llano and <a href="Richard%20Ellis%20%28biologist%29">Richard Ellis</a> suggest that a bull shark could have been responsible for the fatal Jersey Shore attacks. Bull sharks swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have attacked people around the world. In his book "Sharks: Attacks on Man" (1975), Llano writes,

Ellis points out that the great white "is an oceanic species, and Schleisser's shark was caught in the ocean. To find it swimming in a tidal creek is, to say the least, unusual, and may even be impossible. The bull shark, however, is infamous for its freshwater meanderings, as well as for its pugnacious and aggressive nature." He admits that "the bull shark is not a common species in New Jersey waters, but it does occur more frequently than the white."

In an interview with Michael Capuzzo, ichthyologist <a href="George%20H.%20Burgess">George H. Burgess</a> surmises, "The species involved has always been doubtful and likely will continue to generate spirited debate." Burgess, however, does not discount the great white:
The casualties of the 1916 attacks are listed in the <a href="International%20Shark%20Attack%20File">International Shark Attack File</a>—of which Burgess is director—as victims of a great white.

The increased presence of humans in the water proved a factor in the attacks: "As the worldwide human population continues to rise year after year, so does ... interest in aquatic recreation. The number of shark attacks in any given year or region is highly influenced by the number of people entering the water." However, the likelihood that one shark was involved is contested. Scientists such as Victor M. Coppleson and Jean Butler, relying on evidence presented by Lucas and Murphy in 1916, assert that a single shark was responsible. On the other hand, Richard Fernicola notes that 1916 was a "shark year" as fishermen and captains were reporting hundreds of sharks swimming in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Ellis remarks that "to try to make the facts as we know them conform to the 'rogue shark' theory is stretching sensationalism and credibility beyond reasonable limits." He admits, "The evidence is long gone, and we will never really know if it was one shark or several, one species or another, that was responsible."

In 2011, further study was conducted in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Channel">Smithsonian Channel</a>'s "The Real Story: Jaws". The documentary takes a closer look at the series of events from different perspectives. It was demonstrated in the Matawan Creek attacks, for example, that the full moon of the lunar cycle, which would have coincided with the attacks, would have raised the salinity in the water by more than double just a few hours before high tide. This would have shown support for the theory that a great white could have been responsible. Other evidence such as Joseph Dunn's injury suggested that the type of bite was more likely made by a bull shark as opposed to a great white, leading some to believe more than one shark was likely involved in the five incidents.

Before 1916, American scholars doubted that sharks would fatally wound a living person in the <a href="temperate">temperate</a> waters of the northeastern United States without provocation. One skeptical scientist wrote, "There is a great difference between being attacked by a shark and being bitten by one." He believed that sharks tangled in fishing nets or feeding on <a href="carrion">carrion</a> might accidentally bite a nearby human. In 1891, millionaire banker and adventurer <a href="Hermann%20Oelrichs">Hermann Oelrichs</a> offered a $500 reward in the "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Sun%20%28historical%29">New York Sun</a>" "for an authenticated case of a man having been attacked by a shark in [the] temperate waters" north of <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</a>. He wanted proof that "in temperate waters even one man, woman, or child, while alive, was ever attacked by a shark." The reward went unclaimed and scientists remained convinced that the upper eastern coast of the United States was inhabited by harmless sharks.

Academics were skeptical that a shark could produce fatal wounds on human victims. Ichthyologist <a href="Henry%20Weed%20Fowler">Henry Weed Fowler</a> and curator Henry Skinner of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Academy of Natural Sciences</a> in Philadelphia asserted that a shark's <a href="mandible">jaws</a> did not have the power to sever a human leg in a single bite. Frederic Lucas, director of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, questioned whether a shark even as large as 30 feet (9 m) could snap a human bone. He told "The Philadelphia Inquirer" in early 1916 that "it is beyond the power even of the largest <a href="Great%20white%20shark">Carcharodon</a> to sever the leg of an adult man." Lucas summed up his argument by pointing to Oelrichs's unclaimed reward and that the chances of being bitten by a shark were "infinitely less than that of being struck by lightning and that there is practically no danger of an attack from a shark about our coasts."

The Jersey Shore attacks compelled scientists in the United States to revise their assumptions that sharks were timid and powerless. In July 1916, ichthyologist and editor for the National Geographic Society <a href="Hugh%20McCormick%20Smith">Hugh McCormick Smith</a> published an article in the "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">Newark Star-Eagle</a>" describing some shark species as "harmless as doves and others the incarnation of ferocity." He continued, "One of the most prodigious, and perhaps the most formidable of sharks is the man-eater, "<a href="great%20white%20shark">Carcharodon carcharias</a>" [great white]. It roams through all temperate and tropical seas, and everywhere is an object of dread. Its maximum length is forty feet and its teeth are three inches (76 mm) long."

By the end of July 1916, John Nichols and Robert Murphy were taking the great white more seriously. In "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>", Murphy wrote that the "white shark is perhaps the rarest of all noteworthy sharks ... their habits are little known, but they are said to feed to some extent on big sea turtles ... Judging from its physical make-up, it would not hesitate to attack a man in open water." He concluded that "because it is evident that even a relatively small white shark, weighing two or three hundred pounds, might readily snap the largest human bones by a jerk of its body, after it has bitten through the flesh."

Robert Murphy and John Nichols wrote in October 1916:

After the Matawan attacks, Frederic Lucas admitted on the front page of "The New York Times" that he had underestimated sharks. The paper reported that "the foremost authority on sharks in this country has doubted that any shark ever attacked a human being, and has published his doubts, but the recent cases have changed his view." Nichols later documented the occurrence of the great white shark in his biological survey "Fishes of the Vicinity of New York City" (1918), ""Carcharodon carcharias" (Linn.) White Shark. "Man-eater." Accidental in summer. June to July 14, 1916."

While sharks had been seen as harmless, the pendulum of public opinion quickly swung to the other extreme, and sharks quickly came to be viewed not only as eating machines, but also as fearless, ruthless killers.

After the first fatality, <a href="Editorial%20cartoon">newspaper cartoonists</a> began using sharks as <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s for political figures, <a href="German%20U-boats">German U-boats</a>, <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian morality</a> and <a href="Victorian%20fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="polio">polio</a>, and the deadly heat wave threatening the Northeast. Fernicola notes, "Since 1916 was among the years that Americans were trying to break away from the rigidity and <a href="conservatism">conservatism</a> of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian period</a>, one comic depicted a risqué polka-dot bathing suit and advertised it as the secret weapon to keep sharks away from our swimmers." Another cartoon depicted "an exasperated individual at the end of a dock that displays a 'Danger: No Swimming' sign and mentions the three most emphasized 'danger' topics of the day: 'Infantile Paralysis (polio), Epidemic Heat Wave, and Sharks in the Ocean'." The cartoon is entitled "What's a Family Man to Do?" With America's growing distrust of <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> in 1916, cartoonists depicted U-boats with the mouth and fins of a shark assaulting <a href="Uncle%20Sam">Uncle Sam</a> while he wades in the water.

In 1974, writer <a href="Peter%20Benchley">Peter Benchley</a> published "<a href="Jaws%20%28novel%29">Jaws</a>", a novel about a rogue great white shark that terrorizes the fictional coastal community of Amity Island. Chief of police Martin Brody, biologist Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint hunt the shark after it kills four people. The novel was adapted as the film "<a href="Jaws%20%28film%29">Jaws</a>" by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> in 1975. Spielberg's film makes reference to the events of 1916: Brody (<a href="Roy%20Scheider">Roy Scheider</a>) and Hooper (<a href="Richard%20Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>) urge Amity's Mayor Vaughn (<a href="Murray%20Hamilton">Murray Hamilton</a>) to close the beaches on the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Fourth of July</a> after the deaths of two swimmers and a fisherman. Hooper explains to the mayor, "Look, the situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. And he's going to continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water." Brody adds, "And there's no limit to what he's gonna do! I mean we've already had three incidents, two people killed inside of a week. And it's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach! ... 1916! Five people chewed up on the surf!" Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and <a href="Michael%20Capuzzo">Michael Capuzzo</a> suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman <a href="Frank%20Mundus">Frank Mundus</a> inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916. The attacks are also briefly referred to in Benchley's novel "<a href="White%20Shark%20%28novel%29">White Shark</a>" (1994).

The 1916 fatal attacks are the subject of three studies: Richard G. Fernicola's "In Search of the "Jersey Man-Eater"" (1987) and "<a href="Twelve%20Days%20of%20Terror">Twelve Days of Terror</a>" (2001) and Michael Capuzzo's "<a href="Close%20to%20Shore">Close to Shore</a>" (2001). Capuzzo offers an in-depth dramatization of the incident, and Fernicola examines the scientific, medical, and social aspects of the attacks. Fernicola's research is the basis of an episode of the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a>'s <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> series "In Search of History" titled "Shark Attack 1916" (2001) and the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a>'s <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a> "<a href="12%20Days%20of%20Terror">12 Days of Terror</a>" (2004). Fernicola also wrote and directed a 90-minute documentary called "Tracking the Jersey Man-Eater". It was produced by the George Marine Library in 1991; however, it was never widely released.

The attacks at Matawan are the subject of the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> documentary "Attacks of the Mystery Shark" (2002), which examines the possibility that a bull shark was responsible for killing Stanley Fisher and Lester Stilwell; <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a>'s "<a href="Blood%20in%20the%20Water%20%28film%29">Blood in the Water</a>" (2009); <a href="Shore%20Thing">Shore Thing</a> (2009) (directed by Lovari and James Hill); and Smithsonian Channel's "The Real Story: Jaws" (2011).

Archaeoindris

Archaeoindris fontoynontii is an <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">extinct giant lemur</a> and the largest <a href="primate">primate</a> known to have evolved on <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, comparable in size to a male <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>. It belonged to a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of extinct <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s known as "<a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s" (Palaeopropithecidae), and because of its extremely large size, it has been compared to the <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s that once roamed North and South America. It was most closely related to "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", the second largest type of sloth lemur. Along with the other sloth lemurs, "Archaeoindris" was related to the living <a href="indri">indri</a>, <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s, and <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>s, as well as the recently extinct <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s (Archaeolemuridae). The <a href="genus">genus</a>, "Archaeoindris", translates to "ancient indri-like lemur", even though it probably became extinct recently, around 350 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>.

"Archaeoindris" was first described by <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Standing">Herbert F. Standing</a> in 1909 based on <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> fragmentary jaws, although <a href="Charles%20Lamberton">Charles Lamberton</a> later discovered a complete skull. Only six bones from the lower skeleton have been found, and excavations in the 1980s offered no leads for new finds. Its remains have been found at only one location: <a href="Ampasambazimba">Ampasambazimba</a>, a subfossil site in central Madagascar. Following its initial discovery, some subfossil remains of "<a href="Megaladapis">Megaladapis</a> grandidieri" (a type of extinct <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>) were mistakenly associated with "Archaeoindris", while smaller leg bones from a juvenile and a massive adult leg bone were erroneously assumed to belong to two separate species. These errors were gradually corrected between the 1930s and 1980s. The skeleton of "Archaeoindris" was massive and robust, and shared many traits with that of "Palaeopropithecus". The arms were longer than the legs, but no hand or foot bones have been found for comparison with the other sloth lemurs.

Size estimates based on the limited remains have varied widely, ranging as high as , but the most thorough statistical investigation using <a href="multiple%20regression%20analysis">regression analyses</a> predicts a mass of . Misattributions and limited remains have resulted in varying opinions about the way "Archaeoindris" moved in its environment, ranging from tree-dwelling to ground-dwelling. Its skeleton suggests it was a deliberate climber that visited the ground to travel. The diet of "Archaeoindris" was mostly leaves, and its habitat—prior to human arrival—was a mix of <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, bushlands, and <a href="savanna">savanna</a>, rich in lemur diversity. Today, the region is dominated by <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s and lemur diversity is very low in the nearest <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>, <a href="Ambohitantely%20Reserve">Ambohitantely Special Reserve</a>. Although it was a rare lemur, it was still <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> when <a href="Settlement%20of%20Madagascar">humans first arrived on Madagascar</a>, and it would have been vulnerable to hunting and <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>.

The generic name "Archaeoindris", meaning "ancient indri-like lemur", is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word ἀρχαῖος (archaios, or "ancient") and "indris", a common variation of the generic name "<a href="Indri">Indri</a>". The species name, "fontoynontii" (sometimes spelled "fontoynonti"), was selected in honor of Antoine Maurice Fontoynont, the president of the Académie Malgache (<a href="Malagasy%20Academy">Malagasy Academy</a>) at the time. Fontoynont was reported to have been supervising the excavation when it was discovered.

"Archaeoindris" was a type of <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a> (family Palaeopropithecidae), a recently extinct family of giant lemurs (known as <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s) native to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Its ancestors were likely <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> (tree-dwelling), and this giant sloth lemur has been compared to the extinct giant <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s of North and South America.
"Archaeoindris" was most closely related to "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", a genus containing the second largest of the sloth lemurs and specialized for <a href="suspensory%20behavior">suspensory behavior</a> in its arboreal habitat. Traits of the <a href="Postcrania">postcranium</a> (skeleton below the skull) indicate that "<a href="Babakotia">Babakotia</a>" was the next most closely related sloth lemur to "Archaeoindris" and "Palaeopropithecus", followed by "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>", the smallest of the sloth lemurs.

All four genera of sloth lemurs are known to be a <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> (close relatives) of family <a href="Indriidae">Indriidae</a>, which includes the <a href="indri">indri</a> ("Indri"), <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s ("Propithecus"), and <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>s ("Avahi"). This relationship is supported by data from <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a>, <a href="Developmental%20biology">developmental</a>, and <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> research. Another member of this <a href="clade">clade</a> (related group) is the family of <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s (Archaeolemuridae). Dental features, such as the morphology of their <a href="Molar%20tooth">molar teeth</a> and the modified number of teeth in their <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> (a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms), have long suggested a relationship. However, other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a>, which include five genera of lemur, including the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a> ("Lemur catta"). Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former, placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids.

The family Palaeopropithecidae contained a large number of species compared to most other subfossil lemur families. It included four genera and seven species, all of which are now extinct. Among these was the genus "Archaeoindris", one of only a few <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> lemur <a href="Taxon">taxa</a>.

"Archaeoindris fontoynontii" was first described by <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Standing">Herbert F. Standing</a> in 1909 from two fragments of a <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (upper jaw) and a complete <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw). These <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a>s—AM-6239 (maxillae) and AM-6237 (mandible)—are stored in the collection at the <a href="University%20of%20Antananarivo">University of Antananarivo</a>. The mandible contains a complete set of upper teeth, the left maxillary fragment contains the last <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (P4) and all three molars (M1–M3), and the right maxillary fragment bears both premolars (P2 and P4) and the first molar (M1). At the time, Standing noted similarities with the <a href="dentition">dentition</a> of "Palaeopropithecus". Sixteen years after Standing's discovery, <a href="Charles%20Lamberton">Charles Lamberton</a> discovered the first and only complete <a href="cranium">cranium</a> (skull) and associated mandible for "Archaeoindris", both of which were well preserved. He published this find in 1934.

Only six postcranial specimens of "Archaeoindris" have been found. Two of these belonged to an adult and include a damaged <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) and an almost complete <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone). The other four come from an immature individual and include a damaged humerus, a damaged <a href="ulna">ulna</a> (lower arm bone), and two femurs, both lacking the <a href="Epiphysis">epiphyses</a> (rounded end of the bone) on both ends. "Archaeoindris" is one of the least common of the subfossil lemurs, and the few known specimens were all found at <a href="Ampasambazimba">Ampasambazimba</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a>. Excavations run by a multi-disciplinary Malagasy-American team at this fossil site between 1983 and 1984 yielded no new <a href="Subfossil">subfossil remains</a>, and no other potential sites are known for this species.

Historically, some remains from other subfossil lemurs have been mistakenly attributed to "Archaeoindris", resulting in incorrect interpretations of its anatomy and behavior. In 1934, Lamberton missed earlier attribution errors and incorrectly labeled a <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and two <a href="fibula">fibula</a>e (lower leg bones) from a species of <a href="Megaladapis">koala lemur</a> ("Megaladapis grandidieri") as belonging to "Archaeoindris". Because of these misattributions and Lamberton's use of the immature bones, his reconstruction was inaccurate. In 1936, Alice Carleton corrected Lamberton by identifying the tibia and fibulae as belonging to a koala lemur. Carleton's corrections were later confirmed and other misattributions were corrected in the 1960s and 1970s by <a href="Alan%20Walker%20%28anthropologist%29">Alan Walker</a> and <a href="William%20L.%20Jungers">William L. Jungers</a>.

In 1910, twenty-four years before Lamberton's monograph on "Archaeoindris", Standing identified a massive right femur from Ampasambazimba as a new species, "Lemuridotherium madagascariense". Although Standing recognized the strong similarities between "Lemuridotherium" and "Archaeoindris", he placed them in separate genera due to what he perceived as a great size difference. Lamberton was also persuaded by the size difference, partly because he failed to recognize the smaller tibia and fibulae as belonging to the smaller "Megaladapis grandidieri". Furthermore, Lamberton did not realize that the smaller femurs he assigned to "Archaeoindris" belonged to a juvenile. Although some later authors considered "Lemuridotherium" a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "Archaeoindris", it was not until 1988 that Martine Vuillaume-Randriamanantena provided a definitive proof. Vuillaume-Randriamanantena also established associations between the <a href="postcrania">postcrania</a> and <a href="cranium">crania</a> of "Archareoindris", summarized what is known about the postcranial skeleton, and documented the strong similarity with the genus "Palaeopropithecus".

Though similar to "Palaeopropithecus", "Archaeoindris" was significantly larger and more robust. "Archaeoindris" was one of the largest primates to ever evolve, and was the largest-known strepsirrhine primate, weighing an estimated . It was roughly the size of an adult male gorilla, which was first noted by Lamberton.

Since its discovery, size estimates have varied from "larger than a human" to "possibly the largest primate ever". In a study by Jungers from 1990, the area of its molar teeth predicted a mass of , while the <a href="Femur%20head">femoral head</a> diameter predicted a mass of . In 1995, <a href="Laurie%20Godfrey">Laurie Godfrey</a> estimated a mass of using the midshaft circumferences of the humerus and femur. Based on multiple <a href="Regression%20analysis">regressions</a> of the <a href="Cortical%20bone">cortical area</a> of the femur in 2008, Jungers and colleagues generated the current best estimate of with a possible range of . These estimates were considered to be more accurate since the harder cortical bone in the midshaft of the femur supported an animal's weight, and its thickness better correlated with the animal's mass than the midshaft diameter (which includes both hard cortex and <a href="Cancellous%20bone">spongy bone</a>). The only <a href="List%20of%20fossil%20primates">fossil primate</a> that was probably larger than "Archaeoindris" was "<a href="Gigantopithecus">Gigantopithecus blacki</a>", a close relative of <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a>s.

Like all three species of "Palaeopropithecus", "Archaeoindris" exhibited <a href="derived%20trait">derived trait</a>s not seen in the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur. These traits included deflated <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a>e and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> and the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s. Its skull was wider than that of "Megaladapis", but shorter, measuring . Its face was shorter than that of "Palaeopropithecus", with its eyes directed further forward. The <a href="neurocranium">neurocranium</a> (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike "Palaeopropithecus". <a href="Postorbital%20constriction">Postorbital constriction</a> (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. The skull also bore a low, broad <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller <a href="nuchal%20crest">nuchal crest</a>s (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). Unlike "Palaeopropithecus" the rims of the <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> (eye sockets) were not as thick. The area of the orbit was , comparable to that of gorillas. Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its <a href="optic%20canal">optic canal</a>, "Archaeoindris" had low <a href="retinal%20summation">retinal summation</a>, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs). Yet the ratio was not as low as in comparably sized apes, suggesting "Archaeoindris" had low <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a> and lacked <a href="Trichromacy">trichromatic color vision</a>.
The jaw exhibited a long, robust <a href="Symphysis%20menti">mandibular symphysis</a> (joining of the two halves of the lower jaw), which fused early during development. Its <a href="Palate%20%28bones%29">palate</a> (bones on the roof of the mouth) was rectangular. Like other sloth lemurs, it likely experienced accelerated dental development, and had an adult <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> of . Its teeth were also similar to those of "Palaeopropithecus", both in morphology and proportions. The four lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s that would have made up the toothcomb were modified, being shorter and more robust, possibly for feeding purposes. The <a href="Canine%20tooth">canines</a> were short and stout, but sharp. Also, there was a <a href="Diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (gap) between the lower premolars (p2 and p4). Other dental similarities with "Palaeopropithecus" included small third upper and lower molars (M3 and m3), the first and second molars were narrow and long, and the <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> of its cheek teeth was crenulated (low and rounded), though not as wrinkled and slightly higher-<a href="Crown%20%28dentistry%29">crowned</a>.

Most bones of the postcranial skeleton, including the bones of the hands, feet, vertebral column, ribs, <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> (lower arm bone), tibia, and fibula, have not been found for "Archaeoindris". As with many cranial features, the postcranial bones that have been discovered are similar to that of "Palaeopropithecus", but significantly larger and more robust. The head of the femur was large and lacked a <a href="Fovea%20of%20head%20of%20femur">fovea capitis femoris</a> (a small depression in the head of the femur). The femur was short and extremely robust, had a very high collodiaphyseal angle (the angle of the neck and shaft of the bone), and the <a href="greater%20trochanter">greater trochanter</a> was small. In the adult, the humerus was significantly longer than the femur, while in the immature specimen, both the humerus and ulna were much longer than the femur, making the arms considerably longer than the legs, as also seen in "Palaeopropithecus". The relative length of the arms to the legs was shorter in "Archaeoindris", so although its <a href="intermembral%20index">intermembral index</a> was over 100, it was lower than that of "Palaeopropithecus".

"Archaeoindris" is thought to have been a leaf-eater (<a href="Folivore">folivorous</a>), a view supported by wear patterns on its teeth. Its fused mandibular symphyses and the likelihood of accelerated dental development suggest that it began processing fibrous foods in the mouth with thorough chewing. Its diet may also have included some fruits and seeds. Like most of the other giant lemurs, "Archaeoindris" is thought to have been <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> because of its relatively small orbits, which are comparable to those of gorillas.

Both Standing and Lamberton assumed "Archaeoindris" to be a slow-moving tree-dweller like "Megaladapis", primarily due to the misattributed bones. Lamberton also speculated that it would have resembled a ground sloth—a view later supported by Jungers in 1980 after several misattributions had been corrected and having considered its gorilla-like size. Jungers went on to propose that it would have spent most of its time on the ground (<a href="Terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a>). However, the functional morphology of its hip joint indicates a degree of mobility typically seen in more arboreal animals. Other traits shared with "Palaeopropithecus", particularly seen in the femur, suggest that "Archaeoindris" spent considerable time in the trees for feeding and possibly nesting, although it also would have visited the ground to feed and travel. It is described as a deliberate, scansorial (climbing) <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>, and it is unknown whether it was like "Palaeopropithecus" in performing hang-feeding since hand and foot bones are missing. Given its bulky size, this would be unexpected.

"Archaeoindris" is only known from one subfossil site, Ampasambazimba, in central Madagascar, and all remains date to the Late <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a>. The area today is dominated by grasslands, particularly of the grass genus "<a href="Aristida">Aristida</a>". Prior to human arrival, the area around Ampasambazimba was not completely forested, but more of an open habitat, consisting of a mix of woodlands, bushlands, and savanna. Animal remains at this subfossil site have yielded about 20 species of lemur living in <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a> (sharing the same geographic area). In comparison, the nearby <a href="Ambohitantely%20Reserve">Ambohitantely Special Reserve</a> today contains only 4 species, roughly 20% of the area's original lemur diversity.

Despite being the most species-rich family among the giant lemurs, all four genera of sloth lemur, including "Archaeoindris", have gone extinct. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> of the <a href="Stratigraphy">stratigraphic level</a> of some of the "Archaeoindris" remains were dated to 8000 <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>, while two other specimens were dated to 2362–2149 BP (412–199 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>) and 2711–2338 BP (761–388 BCE). From these dates, it is likely that "Archaeoindris" was still alive on the high plateau in 350 BCE when the first humans reached the west coast of Madagascar, despite being rare by that time. Consequently, it would have been especially vulnerable to hunting and <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>.

Cotswold Olimpick Games

The Cotswold Olimpick Games is an annual public celebration of games and sports now held on the Friday after <a href="Spring%20Bank%20Holiday">Spring Bank Holiday</a> near <a href="Chipping%20Campden">Chipping Campden</a>, in the <a href="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> of England. The Games probably began in 1612, and have continued on and off to the present day. They were started by a local lawyer, <a href="Robert%20Dover%20%28Cotswold%20Games%29">Robert Dover</a>, with the approval of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James</a>. Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.

Events included horse-racing, <a href="coursing">coursing</a> with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and <a href="Club%20%28weapon%29">cudgel</a>s, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied for everyone who attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what is now known as Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.

The Games took place on the Thursday and Friday of the week of <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a>, normally between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.

Revived after the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of 1660, the Games gradually degenerated into a drunk and disorderly country festival according to their critics. The Games ended again in 1852, when the <a href="common%20land">common land</a> on which they had been staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently <a href="Enclosure">enclosed</a>. Since 1966 the Games have been held each year on the Friday after <a href="Spring%20Bank%20Holiday">Spring Bank Holiday</a>. Events have included the <a href="tug%20of%20war">tug of war</a>, <a href="gymkhana%20%28equestrian%29">gymkhana</a>, <a href="shin-kicking">shin-kicking</a>, <a href="dwile%20flonking">dwile flonking</a>, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, and <a href="morris%20dancing">morris dancing</a>. The <a href="British%20Olympic%20Association">British Olympic Association</a> has recognised the Cotswold Olimpick Games as "the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings".

The first Olimpick Games were probably held in 1612, organised by lawyer <a href="Robert%20Dover%20%28Cotswold%20Games%29">Robert Dover</a>, although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612. Little is known about Dover. He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, one of four children born to John Dover, and may have been admitted to <a href="Queens%27%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Queens' College</a> at <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> in 1583, leaving early to avoid swearing the <a href="Oath%20of%20Supremacy">Oath of Supremacy</a>. Dover was admitted to <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a> on 27 February 1636, and was probably called to the bar in 1611, the same year he likely moved to Saintbury, near <a href="Chipping%20Campden">Chipping Campden</a>, with his wife and children.

It is unclear whether Dover began the Games from scratch, or took over from an existing event, perhaps a <a href="Parish%20ale">church ale</a>. The Games had the approval of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James</a>, who in his book of advice to his son, "<a href="Basilikon%20Doron">Basilikon Doron</a>" (1599), had written that to promote good feeling among the common people towards their king, "certain days in the year would be appointed, for delighting the people with public spectacles of all honest games, and exercise of arms". Although there was at that time in England a growing admiration for the ancient Greeks, Dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations. His biographer, Christopher Whitfield, claimed that Dover combined ancient countryside practices with "classical mythology and Renaissance culture, whilst linking them with the throne and the King's Protestant Church". Dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the kingdom. He may also have believed that the Games would bring rich and poor together, increasing social harmony, an ideal that might explain why the event captured the public imagination.

<a href="Endymion%20Porter">Endymion Porter</a>, a member of the court of King James, had an estate in the village of Aston-sub-Edge, close to Dover's home. Dover acted as Porter's legal agent between 1622 and 1640, and through him James sent some of his own clothes to Dover, "purposely to grace him and consequently the solemnity [of the Games]". James may also have granted Dover a coat of arms, with the motto "Do Ever Good", as claimed by Dover's grandson, a claim that was rejected by the heraldic authorities in 1682.

The "Annalia Dubrensia" (Annals of Dover), a collection of poems praising Dover and his achievements in promoting and managing the Games, was published in 1636. The contributors included well-known poets such as <a href="Michael%20Drayton">Michael Drayton</a>, <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Randolph%20%28poet%29">Thomas Randolph</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Heywood">Thomas Heywood</a>. They saw the Games as revitalising traditional English social life, and they countered opposition from the critics of such events, who complained of "drunken behaviour and sexual licence", by stressing the "peaceful and well-behaved" nature of the occasion, and even praising the Games as "a gesture of loyalty to the king". The Games had acquired their title of "Olimpicks" by the time the "Annalia Dubrensia" was published, a name approved of by Dover. It secularised the proceedings, while adding an air a gentrification to the sports by linking them with the <a href="ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympics</a> of ancient Greece. Having been brought up in a Catholic family, Dover might well have been keen not to draw attention to religion, particularly if the Games had taken over from an earlier church ale.

The Games took place in a natural amphitheatre on what is known today as Dover's Hill, then called Kingcombe Plain, above the town of <a href="Chipping%20Campden">Chipping Campden</a>, in Gloucestershire. They were held on the Thursday and Friday of Whit-Week, or the week of <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a>, which normally fell between mid-May and mid-June. Dover presided over the Games on horseback, dressed ceremonially in a coat, hat, feather and ruff, donated by King James. Horses and men were decorated with Dover's favours, yellow ribbons pinned to a hat or worn around the arm, leg, or neck. Tents were erected for the <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, who came from the surrounding counties of <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a> and <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, and food was supplied in abundance. The poet Nicholas Wallington wrote that:
A temporary wooden building was constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were summoned to the hillside by the sound of a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, <a href="quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.

The contests were refereed by officials called sticklers, from which the phrase "a stickler for the rules" is derived. Sticklers were so-named because they carried sticks, with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen. No scores or times are recorded for any of the events. Portable watches of the time were "rare, costly, and relatively unreliable devices", but perhaps just as importantly "nobody in Dover's time was much interested in sports record-keeping or record-breaking".

Visitors from all strata of society attended, from agricultural labourers to the nobility, some of whom travelled up to to attend the Games. <a href="Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine">Prince Rupert</a> attended in 1636.

A harper dressed as the Greek poet <a href="Homer">Homer</a> entertained the crowds, enhancing the classical Olympic theme. There was also a maze, known as a <a href="Troy%20Town">Troy Town</a>, constructed from piled up turf with walls about high, through which villagers would dance. Various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents, including chess, Irisha game similar to <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a>and card games such as cent, a game like <a href="piquet">piquet</a>. King James approved of card games "when you have no other thing ado ... and are weary of reading ... and when it is foul and stormy weather", but he considered chess to be "too obsessive a game".

The Games ended with a grand firework display, centred on the castle.

In the 17th century many <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a> believed that the slightest action might lead to sin, and even to <a href="Hell">Hell</a> if it was not repented. They frowned on festivities such as the Games as being of pagan origin, promoting immorality and drunkenness, and disapproved of any celebration on a church holiday such as Whitsun. A Puritan revolt over a 1627 "Bringing in the May" festival at <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Mount Wollaston</a> in present-day <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> resulted in the expulsion of its organiser from the colony. King James, on the other hand, viewed Puritanism as a challenge to the authority of the monarch.

The fine clothes donated by the King, which Dover wore when he presided over the Games, were not just a fashion statement, but also a political one. The feather in Dover's hat was a "flag of defiance to virtue" in Puritan eyes, and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil, according to the Puritan writer <a href="Philip%20Stubbes">Philip Stubbes</a>. He described starch as "[a] certain kind of liquid matter ... wherein the Devil hath learned them [non-Puritans] to wash and die their ruffs".

James was succeeded by King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> in 1625. The new king reluctantly consented to an Act of Parliament "for punishing divers abuses on the Lord's Day, called Sunday". The Act restricted the activities that were allowed to take place on a Sunday, and prohibited any meetings of people outside their own parishes on Sunday. Many Puritan landowners went even further, forbidding their workers to attend any church ales, culminating in two Somerset circuit judges ruling in 1632 that "all public ales be henceforth utterly suppressed".

The following year Charles reversed the judges' ruling of 1632. He produced a new version of James's "<a href="Declaration%20of%20Sports">Book of Sports</a>", which he ordered to be read in every church. In it he wrote:
The outbreak of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> in 1642 brought the Games to an end.

The Games were revived at some uncertain date after the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of 1660. Dover had died in 1652, and bereft of his influence, the Games became "just another drunken country festival", according to an account written by the poet <a href="William%20Somervile">William Somervile</a> in 1740. By then the Games, known as Dover's Meeting, were well established and once again quite popular, and included events such as <a href="backsword">backsword</a> fighting. It is unclear whether the contestants fought with metal or wooden swords, but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved. During a fight at the beginning of the 19th century, one of the contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards. The wrestling competitions had become shin-kicking contests, with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots, sometimes with pointed tips. The poet and writer <a href="Richard%20Graves">Richard Graves</a> described the Games in his <a href="picaresque%20novel">picaresque novel</a> "The Spiritual Quixote" (1773) as a "heathenish assembly". Somervile's account of the 1740 Games describes a general riot in which "chairs, and forms, and battered bowls are hurled/With fell intent; like bombs the bottles fly". Graves dramatised the enthusiasm for the women's race for a Holland shift displayed on a pole: "six young women began to exhibit themselves before the whole assembly, in a dress hardly reconcilable to the rules of decency". By 1845 the Games were being organised by a local publican, William Drury, who paid £5 for the right to do so. He hired out space for stalls and booths, and presumably sold alcohol at the event. The rector of Weston-sub-Edge, the parish in which Dover's Hill is located, Reverend Geoffrey Drinkwater Bourne, claimed that up to 30,000 people were attending the Games by then, and that the hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals. Bourne also claimed that:

The staging of the Games depended on the existence of a suitably large area of <a href="common%20land">common land</a>, but by the mid-19th century much of England's common land was being partitioned up and fenced off. Consent for the <a href="enclosure">enclosure</a> of the parish of Weston-sub-Edge was given in 1850, signalling the end of the Games in 1852. The parish's were divided among local farmers and landowners; Reverend Bourne, who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about the Games, received .

Some historians have suggested that the Games were alluded to in playwright <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>", and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the <a href="quarto">quarto</a> edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a> of 1623, edited by <a href="Henry%20Condell">Henry Condell</a> and <a href="John%20Hemminges">John Hemminges</a>. It is therefore uncertain whether or not it was written by Shakespeare.

The first Shakespearean scholars to make a connection between Dover and Shakespeare were <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, <a href="George%20Steevens">George Steevens</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Warton">Thomas Warton</a>, and <a href="Edmond%20Malone">Edmond Malone</a>; historian Jean Wilson has commented that it required "quite imaginative leaps such as a hill referred to by Bolingbroke [King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV of England</a>] being the hill on which the games were held". More recently, the historian and secretary of the Robert Dover's Games Society, Francis Burns, has suggested that the wrestling scene in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>" "reflects the wrestling at the Games".

Although Shakespeare may have been acquainted with Robert Dover, there is no evidence that he ever attended the Games.

Dover's Hill was bought by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> in 1928, and until recently contained a monument to Robert Dover. The Games were revived for the 1951 <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>, but did not return to being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a> has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after <a href="Spring%20Bank%20Holiday">Spring Bank Holiday</a>, and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the <a href="tug%20of%20war">tug of war</a>, <a href="Gymkhana%20%28equestrian%29">gymkhana</a>, <a href="shin-kicking">shin-kicking</a>, <a href="dwile%20flonking">dwile flonking</a>, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, <a href="morris%20dancing">morris dancing</a>, and, in 1976, poetry.

Casino Royale (novel)

Casino Royale is the <a href="first%20novel">first novel</a> by the British author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>. Published in 1953, it is the first <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">"James Bond" book</a>, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story <a href="anthology">collections</a> by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors.

The story concerns the British secret agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>, gambling at the casino in <a href="Royale-les-Eaux">Royale-les-Eaux</a> to bankrupt <a href="Le%20Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a>, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by <a href="Vesper%20Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a>, a member of his own service, as well as <a href="Felix%20Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> and <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20allies%23Ren%C3%A9%20Mathis">René Mathis</a> of the French <a href="Deuxi%C3%A8me%20Bureau">Deuxième Bureau</a>. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a>, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Fleming's personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a>, that the novel had promise.

Within the spy storyline, "Casino Royale" deals with themes of Britain's position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British traitors <a href="Guy%20Burgess">Guy Burgess</a> and <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>. The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower.

Since publication "Casino Royale" has appeared as a comic strip in a British national newspaper, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>". It has been also adapted for the screen three times: a <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28Climax%21%29">1954 episode</a> of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television series "<a href="Climax%21">Climax!</a>" with <a href="Barry%20Nelson">Barry Nelson</a> as an American Bond, a <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%281967%20film%29">1967 film version</a> with <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> playing "Sir James Bond", and a <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%282006%20film%29">2006 film</a> in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">film series</a> starring <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> as James Bond.

<a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>, the Head of the British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a>, assigns <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>, 007, to play against and bankrupt <a href="Le%20Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a>, the paymaster for a <a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a>-controlled trade union, in a high-stakes <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29">baccarat</a> game at the <a href="Royale-les-Eaux">Royale-les-Eaux</a> casino in northern France. As part of Bond's cover as a rich Jamaican playboy, M also assigns as his companion <a href="Vesper%20Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a>, personal assistant to the Head of Section S (<a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>). The <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> and the French <a href="Deuxi%C3%A8me%20Bureau">Deuxième Bureau</a> also send agents as observers. The game soon turns into an intense confrontation between Le Chiffre and Bond; Le Chiffre wins the first round, cleaning Bond out of his funds. As Bond contemplates the prospect of reporting his failure to M, the CIA agent, <a href="Felix%20Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, gives him an envelope of money and a note: "<a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Aid</a>. Thirty-two million <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>. With the compliments of the USA." The game continues, despite the attempts of one of Le Chiffre's minders to kill Bond. Bond eventually wins, taking from Le Chiffre eighty million francs belonging to SMERSH.

Desperate to recover the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and <a href="torture">torture</a>s Bond, threatening to kill them both if he does not get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a> '<a href="Sha%20%28Cyrillic%29">Ш</a>' for "шпион" ("shpión", Russian for spy) into Bond's hand so that future SMERSH agents will be able to identify him as such.

Lynd visits Bond every day as he recuperates in hospital, and he gradually realises that he loves her; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers. One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements, which greatly distresses Lynd. The following morning, Bond finds that she has committed suicide. She leaves behind a note explaining that she had been working as an unwilling <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> for the Russian <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Russia%29">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a>. SMERSH had kidnapped her lover, a Polish <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> pilot, who had revealed information about her under torture; SMERSH then used that information to <a href="blackmail">blackmail</a> her into helping them undermine Bond's mission, including her own faked kidnapping. She had tried to start a new life with Bond, but upon seeing Gettler—a SMERSH agent—she realised that she would never be free of her tormentors, and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger. Bond informs his service of Lynd's duplicity, coldly telling his contact, "The bitch is dead now."

<a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>, born in 1908, was a son of <a href="Valentine%20Fleming">Valentine Fleming</a>, a wealthy banker and MP who died in action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in May 1917. Educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Sandhurst</a> and, briefly, the universities of <a href="Munich%20University">Munich</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Geneva">Geneva</a>, Fleming moved through several jobs before he was recruited by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Henry%20Godfrey">John Godfrey</a>, the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Director of Naval Intelligence</a>, to become his <a href="personal%20assistant">personal assistant</a>. Fleming joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, with the codename "17F", and worked for them throughout the war. Early in 1939 he began an affair with Ann O'Neill ( Charteris), who was married to the <a href="Baron%20O%27Neill">3rd Baron O'Neill</a>.

In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, he decided to live on the island once the war was over. His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in <a href="Saint%20Mary%20Parish%2C%20Jamaica">Saint Mary Parish</a> where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye</a>. The name of the house and estate has many possible sources. Fleming mentioned both his wartime <a href="Operation%20Goldeneye">Operation Goldeneye</a> and <a href="Carson%20McCullers">Carson McCullers</a>' 1941 novel "<a href="Reflections%20in%20a%20Golden%20Eye%20%28novel%29">Reflections in a Golden Eye</a>", which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a>.

Upon Fleming's <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20British%20Armed%20Forces%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War">demobilisation</a> in May 1945, he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>". In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take two months holiday every winter in Jamaica. In 1948 Charteris gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was <a href="Stillbirth">stillborn</a>; Charteris and Fleming became engaged shortly in 1951.

Fleming had previously mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel, but it was not until early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write "Casino Royale" at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for "Books and Bookmen" magazine in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day."

Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he described as his "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" on whom the character <a href="Miss%20Moneypenny">Miss Moneypenny</a> was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, <a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a> to see a copy, and remarked "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it ... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I have got to take that chance." Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28writer%29">Peter</a>, an established travel writer whose books they managed.

Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—put the events of "Casino Royale" in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could have taken place in either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.

"Casino Royale" was inspired by certain incidents that took place during Fleming's wartime career at the Naval Intelligence Division (NID), or by events of which he was aware. On a trip to Portugal, en route to the United States, Fleming and the NID Director, Admiral Godfrey, went to the <a href="Casino%20Estoril">Estoril Casino</a>. Because of Portugal's neutral status, Estoril's population had been swelled by spies and agents from the warring regimes. Fleming claimed that while there he was cleaned out by a "chief German agent" at a table playing <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29%23Chemin%20de%20fer">chemin de fer</a>. Admiral Godfrey told a different story: that Fleming only played Portuguese businessmen, and afterwards fantasised about playing against German agents.

The failed attempt to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was inspired by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of <a href="Franz%20von%20Papen">Franz von Papen</a>, <a href="Vice-Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Vice-Chancellor of Germany</a> and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, "", in which the steel string of a <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.

Fleming also included four references in the novel to "Red Indians", including twice on the last page, which came from a unit of <a href="British%20Commandos">commandos</a>, known as <a href="No.%2030%20Commando">No. 30 Commando</a> or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. The unit was Fleming's idea, and he nicknamed the troops his "Red Indians", although they disliked the name.

The lead character of "Casino Royale" is James Bond, an agent of the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28ornithologist%29">James Bond</a>, author of the ornithology guide, "<a href="Birds%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">Birds of the West Indies</a>". Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". He further explained that "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard."

Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer <a href="Hoagy%20Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a> and himself, and in the novel Lynd remarks that "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." According to <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a>, Fleming's biographer, "within the first few pages ... [Fleming] had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included his looks, his <a href="Bentley%204%C2%BD%20Litre">Bentley</a> and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it <a href="Vesper%20%28cocktail%29">"The Vesper"</a>, after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep <a href="Champagne%20stemware">champagne goblet</a>, was for "three measures of <a href="Gordon%27s%20Gin">Gordon's</a>, one of <a href="vodka">vodka</a>, half a measure of <a href="Lillet">Kina Lillet</a>. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel."

Speaking of Bond's origins, Fleming said that "he was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war", although the author gave many of his own traits to the character. Bond's tastes are often taken from Fleming's own, as is some of his behaviour: Fleming used the casino to introduce Bond in his first novel because "skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman". Lycett sees much of Bond's character as being "wish fulfilment" by Fleming.

Bond's superior, M, was largely based on Godfrey, Fleming's NID superior officer; Godfrey was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English <a href="occult">occult</a>ist, astrologer, <a href="mysticism">mystic</a> and <a href="ceremonial%20magic">ceremonial magic</a>ian <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre's. Crowley's tastes, especially in sado-masochism, were also ascribed to Le Chiffre; as Fleming's biographer Henry Chancellor notes, "when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond's testicles with a carpet-beater and a carving knife, the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there lurking in the background."

Fleming later said of his work, "while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the author <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> called "the Fleming effect". Amis describes it as "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced." Within the text the novelist <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—identifies what he described as the "Fleming Sweep", the use of "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what the novelist <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> calls "a heightened journalistic style" to produce "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".

The <a href="Semiotics">semiotician</a> and essayist, <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a>, in his 1979 examination of the Bond books, "The Narrative Structure of Ian Fleming", considered that Fleming "has a rhythm, a polish, a certain sensuous feeling for words. That is not to say that Fleming is an artist; yet he writes with art." When examining the passage relating to the death of Le Chiffre, Eco wrote that "there is a ... baroque feeling for the image, a total adaptation off the image without emotional comment, and a use of words that designate things with accuracy", and he went on to conclude that "Fleming is more literate than he gives one to understand."

"Casino Royale" was written after, and was heavily influenced by, the Second World War; Britain was still an imperial power, and the Western and Eastern blocs were engaged in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire, "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and <a href="Tony%20Bennett%20%28sociologist%29">Tony Bennett</a> agree, and consider that "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining."

In 1953 parts of central London, including <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a> and <a href="High%20Holborn">High Holborn</a> still had uncleared bomb sites and, while sweets had ceased being rationed, coal and other food items were still regulated. According to "The Times" journalist and historian <a href="Ben%20Macintyre">Ben Macintyre</a>, Bond was "the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power".

"Casino Royale" deals with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—<a href="Guy%20Burgess">Guy Burgess</a> and <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.

Amis, in his exploration of Bond in "<a href="The%20James%20Bond%20Dossier">The James Bond Dossier</a>", pointed out that Leiter is "such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he". The journalist and author <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> observed that "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". David Seed, in his examination of spy fiction, disagrees, and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre, his "activities are constantly supported by American agencies, financing and know-how".

The treachery of Le Chiffre, with the overtones of a <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a>, struck a chord with the largely British readership as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament at the time. Britain had also suffered from defections to the Soviet Union from two MI6 operatives who were part of the <a href="Cambridge%20Five">Cambridge Five</a> spy ring that betrayed Western secrets to the Soviets. Thus Lycett observes that "Casino Royale" can be seen as Fleming's "attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like Burgess and Maclean". The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that with the defections of the two spies so recent to the publication, it was "perhaps the closest Fleming came to a <a href="John%20le%20Carr%C3%A9">[John] le Carré</a>-style spy story". Chancellor sees the moral ambiguity of the Cold War reflected in the novel.

Benson considers the most obvious theme of the novel to be good versus evil. Parker agrees, and highlights a conversation between Bond and Matthis in the chapter titled "The Nature of Evil", in which Bond says: "By ... [Le Chiffre's] evil existence ... he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist." The subject was also dealt with by the academic Beth Butterfield, in an examination of Bond from an <a href="Existentialism">existentialist</a> viewpoint. In light of Bond's conversation, Butterfield identifies a crisis of confidence in Bond's character, where he has "moved beyond good and evil" to the point where he does his job not because of principles, but to pursue personal battles. Eco comes to the same conclusion, stating that Bond "abandon[s] the treacherous life of moral mediation and of psychological anger, with all the dangers they entail."

Black also identifies a mechanism Fleming uses in "Casino Royale"—and in subsequent "Bond" novels—which is to use the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.

"Casino Royale" was first released on 13 April 1953 in the UK as a hardback edition by publishers Jonathan Cape, with a cover devised by Fleming. Cape printed 4,728 copies of "Casino Royale", which sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. The sales figures were strong enough for Cape to offer Fleming a three-book deal. In April 1955 <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a> issued a paperback version and sold 41,000 copies in the first year.

In the US three publishers turned the book down before <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers">Macmillan Publishing Co</a> offered Fleming a deal. "Casino Royale" was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies across the entire US during the course of the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher <a href="Popular%20Library">American Popular Library</a>; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, "The Double-O Agent" and "The Deadly Gamble", were disregarded in favour of "You Asked for It", but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular Library version also changed Bond's name, calling him "Jimmy Bond".

<a href="Hugh%20I%27Anson%20Fausset">Hugh I'Anson Fausset</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", thought that "Casino Royale" was "a first-rate thriller ... with a breathtaking plot". Although he considered the book to be "schoolboy stuff", he felt the novel was "galvanised into life by the hard brilliance of the telling". Alan Ross, writing in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>" wrote that "Casino Royale" was "an extremely engaging affair", and that "the especial charm ... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables". He concluded that the book was "both exciting and extremely civilized". Reviewing for "<a href="The%20Listener%20%28magazine%29">The Listener</a>", <a href="Simon%20Raven">Simon Raven</a> believed that Fleming was a "kind of supersonic John Buchan", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is "a brilliant but improbable notion" that includes "a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc ... with a cretinous love-affair". Raven also dismissed Bond as an "infantile" creation, but did allow that "Fleming tells a good story with strength and distinction ... his creation of a scene, both visually and emotionally, is of a very high order indeed."

<a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", considered that "Ian Fleming has discovered the secret of the narrative art ... which is to work up to a climax unrevealed at the end of each chapter. Thus the reader has to go on reading". Publishers Jonathan Cape included many of the reviews on their advertisements for the book, which appeared in a number of national newspapers; the reviews included those from "The Sunday Times", which concluded that Fleming was "the best new English thriller-writer since <a href="Eric%20Ambler">[Eric] Ambler</a>" and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", which advised their readers: "don't miss this".

The critic for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine examined <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>'s "<a href="The%20Long%20Goodbye%20%28novel%29">The Long Goodbye</a>" alongside "Casino Royale"; he praised "Casino Royale", saying that "Fleming keeps his incidents and characters spinning through their paces like juggling balls." The "Time" reviewer went on to say that "As for Bond, he might be <a href="Philip%20Marlowe">[Philip] Marlowe</a>'s younger brother except that he never takes coffee for a bracer, just one large Martini laced with vodka."

Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a> wrote that the book belongs "pretty much to the private-eye school" of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming "manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and produced as exciting a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader through a set of tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over."

In 1954 <a href="CBS">CBS</a> paid Ian Fleming $1,000 to adapt "Casino Royale" into a <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28Climax%21%29">one-hour television adventure</a> as part of its "<a href="Climax%21">Climax!</a>" series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred <a href="Barry%20Nelson">Barry Nelson</a> as secret agent "Card Sense" James 'Jimmy' Bond and <a href="Peter%20Lorre">Peter Lorre</a> as Le Chiffre. A brief tutorial on baccarat is given at the beginning of the show by the presenter of the programme, <a href="William%20Lundigan">William Lundigan</a>, to enable viewers to understand a game which was not popular in America at the time. For this Americanised version of the story, Bond is an American agent, described as working for "Combined Intelligence", while the character Leiter from the original novel is British, renamed "Clarence Leiter". The agent for Station S., Mathis, does not appear as such; his surname is given to the leading lady, named Valérie Mathis instead of Vesper Lynd.

In March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of "Casino Royale" to the producer <a href="Gregory%20Ratoff">Gregory Ratoff</a> for $6,000. After Ratoff's death, producer <a href="Charles%20K.%20Feldman">Charles K. Feldman</a> represented Ratoff's widow and obtained the rights to make <a href="Casino%20Royale%20%281967%20film%29">a film version</a>. Feldman decided the best way to profit from the film rights was to make a satirical version, which was produced and released in 1967 by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. The film, which cast <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> as Bond, was made with five credited directors (plus one uncredited) and a cast that included <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>, <a href="Ursula%20Andress">Ursula Andress</a>, <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> and <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>. The 1967 version is described by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> as "an incoherent all-star comedy".

"Casino Royale" was the first James Bond novel to be adapted as a <a href="James%20Bond%20%28comic%20strip%29">daily comic strip</a>; it was published in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" and syndicated worldwide. The strip ran from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958, and was written by <a href="Anthony%20Hern">Anthony Hern</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>. To aid "The Daily Express" in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. McLusky felt that Fleming's 007 looked too "outdated" and "pre-war" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. A graphic novel adaptation of the book was released by <a href="Dynamite%20Entertainment">Dynamite Entertainment</a> in April 2018, written by Van Jensen and illustrated by <a href="Dennis%20Calero">Dennis Calero</a>.

Following the 1967 adaptation, the rights to the film remained with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio, and the rights to their <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company <a href="Sony">Sony</a>. In 1999, following legal action between <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Entertainment">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a> and <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM/UA</a>, Sony traded the rights to "Casino Royale" for MGM's partial-rights to "<a href="Spider-Man%20%282002%20film%29">Spider-Man</a>". This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%282006%20film%29">Casino Royale</a>". The film stars <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> as Bond, supported by <a href="Eva%20Green">Eva Green</a> as Vesper Lynd and <a href="Mads%20Mikkelsen">Mads Mikkelsen</a> as Le Chiffre; <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. "Casino Royale" is a <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a>, showing Bond at the beginning of his career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.

Haflinger

The Haflinger, also known as the Avelignese, is a <a href="horse%20breed">breed</a> of <a href="horse">horse</a> developed in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and northern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> (namely <a href="Hafling">Hafling</a> in <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> region) during the late nineteenth century. Haflinger horses are relatively small, are always chestnut with flaxen mane and tail, have distinctive <a href="horse%20gait">gaits</a> described as energetic but smooth, and are well-muscled yet elegant. The breed traces its ancestry to the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>; there are several theories for its origin. Haflingers, developed for use in mountainous terrain, are known for their hardiness. Their current <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> and appearance are the result of infusions of bloodlines from <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> and various European breeds into the original native <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrolean</a> ponies. The <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation sire</a>, 249 Folie, was born in 1874; by 1904 the first breeders' cooperative was formed. All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines. World Wars I and II, as well as the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, had a detrimental effect on the breed, and lower-quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction. During World War II, breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more <a href="draft%20horse">draft</a>-like, favored by the military for use as <a href="packhorse">packhorse</a>s. The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height.

In the postwar era, the Haflinger was indiscriminately <a href="crossbreed">crossed</a> with other breeds and some observers feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction. However, starting in 1946, breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a <a href="closed%20stud%20book">closed stud book</a> was created. Interest in the breed increased in other countries and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005, almost 250,000 Haflingers existed worldwide. There are breeding farms in several countries, although most of the breeding stock still comes from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be <a href="cloning">cloned</a>, resulting in a <a href="filly">filly</a> named <a href="Prometea">Prometea</a>.

Haflingers have many uses including light draft, <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">harness</a> work and various <a href="equestrianism">under-saddle</a> disciplines such as <a href="endurance%20riding">endurance riding</a>, <a href="dressage">dressage</a>, <a href="equestrian%20vaulting">equestrian vaulting</a> and <a href="therapeutic%20horseback%20riding">therapeutic riding</a>. They are also still used by the Austrian and German armies for work in rough terrain. The World Haflinger Federation (WHF), the international governing body that controls breed standards for the Haflinger, is made up of a confederation of 22 national <a href="breed%20registry">registries</a>, and helps set breeding objectives, guidelines and rules for its member organizations.

The name "Haflinger" comes from the village of <a href="Hafling">Hafling</a>, which today is in northern Italy. The breed is also called the Avelignese, from the Italian name for Hafling, which is "Avelengo" or previously "Aveligna". Haflingers are always <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> in color and come in shades ranging from a light gold to a rich golden chestnut or <a href="liver%20%28color%29">liver</a> hue. The mane and tail are white or <a href="flaxen%20gene">flaxen</a>. The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II, when it stood an average of . The desired height today is between . Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size, but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry. The breed has a refined head and light <a href="poll%20%28livestock%29">poll</a>. The neck is of medium length, the <a href="withers">withers</a> are pronounced, the shoulders sloping and the chest deep. The <a href="back%20%28horse%29">back</a> is medium-long and muscular, the <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a> is long, slightly sloping and well-muscled. The legs are clean, with broad, flat knees and powerful <a href="hock%20%28zoology%29">hocks</a> showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments. The Haflinger has rhythmic, ground-covering <a href="horse%20gait">gaits</a>. The walk is relaxed but energetic. The <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a> and <a href="canter">canter</a> are elastic, energetic, and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the <a href="forehand%20%28horse%29">forehand</a> and balanced. There is some knee action, and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards. One important consideration in breeding during the second half of the 20th century was temperament. A requirement for a quiet, kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections. Some sources recognize two types of Haflinger, a shorter, heavier type used for draft work and a taller, lighter type used for pleasure riding, light driving and under-saddle competition. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> recognizes both an "Avelignese" and an "Avelignese Tradizionale" as existing in Italy, although, as of 2007, only 13 of the latter existed, including only one breeding stallion. However, all breed organizations recognize and register only one type.

All Haflingers today trace their lineage through one of seven stallion lines to Folie, the foundation stallion of the breed. Usually, <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colts</a> are given a name beginning with the letter or letters denoting their stallion line, and <a href="filly">fillies</a> are given a name beginning with the first letter of their dam's name. The exceptions are France, where <a href="foal">foal</a>s are given a name beginning with a letter of the alphabet designated to be used for that year; and Italy, where colts' names must begin with the letter or letters designating the stallion line, while fillies' names begin with the letter designated for a given year. The seven stallion lines are:


Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, while the rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially in the early years of the breed's history, some inbreeding occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.

The history of the Haflinger horse traces to the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Origins of the breed are uncertain, but there are two main theories. The first is that Haflingers descend from horses abandoned in the <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrolean</a> valleys in central Europe by East <a href="Goths">Goths</a> fleeing from <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> troops after the fall of <a href="Conza">Conza</a> in 555 AD. These abandoned horses are believed to have been influenced by Oriental bloodlines and may help explain the <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> physical characteristics seen in the Haflinger. A type of light mountain pony was first recorded in the <a href="Adige">Etsch Valley</a> in 1282, and was probably the ancestor of the modern Haflinger. The second theory is that they descended from a <a href="stallion">stallion</a> from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy">Kingdom of Burgundy</a> sent to <a href="Louis%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Margrave Louis of Brandenburg</a> by his father, <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, when the <a href="John%20II%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Margrave</a> married Princess <a href="Margarete%20Maultasch">Margarete Maultasch</a> of the Tyrol in 1342. It has also been suggested that they descend from the prehistoric <a href="History%20of%20horse%20domestication%20theories">Forest horse</a>. Haflingers have close connections to the <a href="Noriker%20horse">Noriker</a>, a result of the overlapping geographic areas where the two breeds were developed. Whatever its origins, the breed developed in a mountainous climate and was well able to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal maintenance.

The breed as it is known today was officially established in the village of Hafling in the <a href="Trentino-Alto%20Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol">Etschlander Mountains</a>, then located in <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. The Arabian influence was strongly reinforced in the modern Haflinger by the introduction of the stallion El Bedavi, imported to Austria in the 19th century. El-Bedavi's half-Arabian great-grandson, El-Bedavi XXII, was bred at the <a href="Austro-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> stud at <a href="Radautz">Radautz</a> and was <a href="sire">sire</a> of the breed's <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation stallion</a>, 249 Folie, born in 1874 in the <a href="Vinschgau">Vinschgau</a>. Folie's <a href="Mother">dam</a> was a native Tyrolean <a href="mare">mare</a> of refined type. All Haflingers today must trace their ancestry to Folie through one of seven stallion lines (A, B, M, N, S, ST, and W) to be considered <a href="purebred">purebred</a>. The small original <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a>, and the mountain environment in which most original members of the breed were raised, has resulted in a very fixed physical type and appearance. In the early years of the breed's development <a href="Oriental%20horse">Oriental</a> stallions such as Dahoman, Tajar and Gidran were also used as <a href="Stud%20%28animal%29">studs</a>, but foals of these stallions lacked many key Haflinger traits and breeding to these sires was discontinued. After the birth of Folie in 1874, several Austrian noblemen became interested in the breed and petitioned the government for support and direction of organized breeding procedures. It was 1899 before the Austrian government responded, deciding to support breeding programs through establishment of subsidies; high-quality Haflinger fillies were among those chosen for the government-subsidized breeding program. Since then the best Haflinger fillies and colts have been chosen and selectively bred to maintain the breed's quality. Horses not considered to meet quality standards were used by the army as pack animals. By the end of the 19th century Haflingers were common in both <a href="South%20Tyrol">South</a> and <a href="North%20Tyrol">North Tyrol</a>, and stud farms had been established in <a href="Styria">Styria</a>, <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> and <a href="Lower%20Austria">Lower Austria</a>. In 1904, the Haflinger Breeders' Cooperative was founded in <a href="M%C3%B6lten">Mölten</a>, in South Tyrol, with the aim of improving breeding procedures, encouraging pure-breeding and establishing a <a href="studbook">studbook</a> and stallion registry.

World War I resulted in many Haflingers being taken into military service and the interruption of breeding programs. After the war, under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint%20Germain">Treaty of Saint Germain</a>, South Tyrol (including Hafling) was ceded to Italy, while North Tyrol remained in Austria. This split was extremely detrimental to the Haflinger breed, as most of the brood mares were in South Tyrol in what was now Italy, while the high-quality breeding stallions had been kept at studs in North Tyrol and so were still in Austria. Little effort at cooperation was made between breeders in North and South Tyrol, and in the 1920s a new Horse Breeders' Commission was established in <a href="Bolzano">Bolzano</a> in Italy, which was given governmental authority to inspect state-owned breeding stallions, register privately owned stallions belonging to Commission members, and give prize money for <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a> competition. The Commission governed the breeding of the Italian population of both the Haflinger and the Noriker horse. In 1921, because of the lack of breeding stallions in Italy, a crossbred <a href="Sardinian%20%28horse%29">Sardinian</a>-Arabian stallion was used for the Haflinger breeding program, as well as many lower-quality purebred Haflingers.
If not for the presence of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in <a href="Stadl-Paura">Stadl-Paura</a> in <a href="Upper%20Austria">Upper Austria</a> after World War I, the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today. Despite these stallions, the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria, with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices. During this time, the breed was kept alive through crosses to the <a href="Hucul%20pony">Hucul</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20Pony">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Konik">Konik</a> and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria, many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war. In 1921, the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders' Cooperative was formed in <a href="Zams">Zams</a>, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in the same location. Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares, and every effort was made to import higher-quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy. In 1926, the first studbook was established in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in <a href="Weer">Weer</a> and <a href="Wildsch%C3%B6nau">Wildschönau</a>, and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. This single transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol, and many others were sold through private treaty, leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding-stock populations. In 1931, another breeders' cooperative was established in <a href="East%20Tyrol">East Tyrol</a> in Austria, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the late 1920s and early 1930s dampened horse prices and had an unfavorable effect on Haflinger breeding, but from 1938 onwards markets improved as a result of the buildup for World War II. All crossbred horses and colts not of breeding quality could be sold to the army, and higher subsidies were given by the government to Haflinger breeders. However, the demands of the war also meant that many unregistered mares of Haflinger type were <a href="mating">covered</a> by registered stallions, and the resulting progeny were registered, resulting in a degradation of breeding stock. In 1935 and 1936, a breeding program was begun in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> through the cooperation of the German agricultural authorities, military authorities and existing stud farms. The first government-run German Haflinger stud farm was established in <a href="Oberaudorf">Oberaudorf</a> with brood mares from North and South Tyrol, and several private stud farms were established elsewhere in the country. The combination of a high demand for pack horses and variable amounts of breed knowledge of the purchasers led to the purchase of both high- and low-quality horses, which had mixed results on breed quality. Purchases by Bavarians also resulted in a further depletion of Austrian and Italian stock, already low from the population depletions of both world wars. However, the <a href="German%20Armed%20Forces">German Armed Forces</a> were ready purchasers, and the purchasing and breeding continued. Despite some claims that only purebred horses were registered, many well-known Bavarian studs had crossbred maternal lines. During World War II, Haflingers were <a href="selective%20breeding">bred</a> to produce horses that were shorter and more <a href="draft%20horse">draft</a>-like for use as <a href="packhorse">packhorse</a>s by the military. After the war, breeding emphasis changed to promote refinement and height.

After World War II, Haflinger breeding programs almost collapsed as the military stopped buying horses and government-run breeding centers were closed. Breeders continued to emphasize those features necessary for pack horses (the largest use by the military), but neglected other key Haflinger characteristics. Haflinger breeding had to change to create a horse that better fit modern trends toward recreational use. Around this time, all small breed cooperatives were combined into the Haflinger Breeders' Association of Tyrol. Post-World War II Tyrol, including the breeding center at Zams, was under the control of American forces, who slaughtered many horses to provide <a href="horse%20meat">meat</a> for hospitals. However, the troops did allow the breeding director to choose 30 stallions to be kept for breeding purposes. Those horses were relocated to the French-occupied <a href="Kops%20Alm">Kops Alm</a> high pasture in <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>, but they were subsequently stolen and never seen again. In other areas of Tyrol, all one- to three-year-old colts had been requisitioned by military breeding centers, and therefore it was necessary to treat colts not even a year old as potential breeding stallions. In the years after World War II, some observers feared that the breed was dying out because of indiscriminate crossing with other breeds.
At conferences in 1946 and 1947, the decision was made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a <a href="closed%20stud%20book">closed stud book</a> with no new blood being introduced. The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring that the association maintained 100 percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale <a href="breed%20show">breed show</a> was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>.

Between 1950 and 1974, even as the overall European equine population was dropping due to increased mechanization, the Haflinger population was increasing. In that time period, the population of registered Haflinger brood mares rose from 1,562 to 2,043. This was mainly a result of the increased marketing of the breed, and happened even as <a href="Fjord%20horse">Norwegian Fjord</a> horses were exported to Germany, reducing the resources available for Haflinger breeding programs. Through well-planned marketing campaigns, the Haflinger became the dominant small-horse breed in the region. In 1954, Yugoslavia and Italy purchased breeding stock from North Tyrol to establish their own Haflinger programs and in 1956 the German Democratic Republic followed suit. The first Haflingers were exported to the United States from Austria in 1958 by Tempel Smith of Tempel Farms in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> and into Czechoslovakia in 1959. Tyrolean Haflingers were purchased by the Netherlands and Turkey in 1961. In Turkey they were both bred pure and crossed with the <a href="Karacabey%20%28horse%29">Karacabey</a> breed. In 1963, the first Haflinger was exported to Great Britain, in 1969 two Haflinger mares were presented to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> upon her official visit to Austria, and in 1970, the Haflinger Society of Great Britain was established. The first Haflinger was exported to France in 1964, and they continued to be transferred to that country until 1975, when the breeding population became stable. Between 1980 and 2000, the population of Haflingers in France tripled. In 1965, the first international Haflinger show was held at <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, with horses from East and West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Austria participating. Haflingers were first exported to Belgium in 1966, to Bhutan in 1968, and to Poland, Hungary and Albania in subsequent years. The importations to Bhutan encouraged interest in the breed in other parts of Asia. In 1974, the first Haflinger was imported to Australia. The first Canadian Haflinger was registered with the United States breed association in 1977, and a Canadian registry was formed in 1980. Between 1970 and 1975, Haflingers were also imported into Luxemburg, Denmark, Thailand, Columbia, Brazil, southwest Africa, Sweden and Ireland. They have also been imported into Japan. Haflingers maintained a population on every populated continent by the end of the 1970s. Worldwide breeding continued through the 1980s and 1990s, and population numbers increased steadily.

Although the Haflinger is now found all over the world, the majority of breeding stock still comes from Austria, where <a href="Stud%20farm%23State%20stud%20farms">state studs</a> own the stallions and carefully maintain the quality of the breed. However, there are breeding farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of <a href="Brittany%20%28administrative%20region%29">Brittany</a>, <a href="Burgundy%20%28French%20region%29">Burgundy</a> and <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a>, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005 there were almost 250,000 Haflingers in the world.

On May 28, 2003, a Haflinger filly named <a href="Prometea">Prometea</a> became the first horse <a href="Cloning">clone</a> born. Bred by Italian scientists, she was cloned from a mare <a href="skin">skin</a> <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>, and was a healthy foal. In 2008, Prometea herself gave birth to the first offspring of an equine clone, a colt named Pegaso sired by a Haflinger stallion through <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a>. The American Haflinger Registry does not allow horses born as a result of cloning to be registered, although as of 2010 other nations' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic. In January 2012, <a href="Breyer%20Horses">Breyer Horses</a> created a <a href="model%20horse">model horse</a> of the Haflinger.

Haflingers were bred to be versatile enough for many under-saddle disciplines, but still solid enough for draft and <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a> work. The Haflinger was originally developed to work in the mountainous regions of its native land, where it was used as a packhorse and for forestry and agricultural work. In the late 20th century Haflingers were used by the Indian Army in an attempt to breed pack animals for mountainous terrain, but the program was unsuccessful because of the Haflinger's inability to withstand the desert heat. The Austrian Army still uses Haflingers as packhorses in rough terrain. They are used most often in high Alpine terrain, with slopes up to 40 percent and steps of up to . There are around 70 horses in use, held by the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28Austria%29">6th Infantry Brigade</a> and based in <a href="Hochfilzen">Hochfilzen</a>. The Haflinger is also used by the German army for rough terrain work and demonstration purposes.

Today the breed is used in many activities that include draft and pack work, light harness and <a href="combined%20driving">combined driving</a>, and many under-saddle events, including <a href="western%20riding">western</a>-style horse-show classes, <a href="trail%20riding">trail</a> and <a href="endurance%20riding">endurance riding</a>, <a href="dressage">dressage</a>, <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>, <a href="equestrian%20vaulting">vaulting</a>, and <a href="therapeutic%20horseback%20riding">therapeutic riding</a> programs. They are used extensively as dressage horses for children, but are tall and sturdy enough to be suitable riding horses for adults. In the 1970s, British <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a> competed with a driving team of four Haflingers. There are several national shows for Haflingers worldwide, including those in Germany, Great Britain and the United States. Despite the Austrian prohibitions against crossbreeding, other countries have practiced this to some extent. Good quality animals have been produced out of crosses between Haflingers and both Arabians and <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusians</a>. British enthusiasts maintain a partbred registry for Haflinger crosses. In Germany, horses that are 75 percent Haflinger and 25 percent Arabian are popular and are called Arabo-Haflingers. In Italy, where horse meat consumption is at the highest among all <a href="European%20Community">European Community</a> members, Haflingers provide a large percentage of national production. Most are either bred specifically for meat production and slaughtered between the ages of 10 and 18 months, or as a result of health problems, or age. The Haflinger also produces the majority of the horse milk consumed in Germany.

<a href="Breed%20registry">Breed organizations</a> exist in many countries to provide accurate documentation of Haflinger pedigrees and ownership, and to promote the Haflinger breed. Most are linked to each other through membership in the World Haflinger Federation (WHF), established in 1976. The WHF establishes international breeding guidelines, objectives and rules for <a href="studbook%20selection">studbook selection</a> and performance tests. They also authorize European and World Shows and compile an annual list of Haflinger experts, or adjudicators. The WHF is the international umbrella organization, with 21 member organizations in 22 countries. Membership organizations include the Haflinger Horse Society of Australia, the Australian Haflinger Horse Breeders Association, the Canadian Haflinger Association, the Haflinger Pferdezuchtverband Tirol (Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association), the Italian "Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Cavalli di Razza Haflinger Italia" and the American Haflinger Registry, as well as a division for breeders in countries that are not already members. National organizations are allowed to become members of the WHF through agreeing to promote pure breeding and maintain the hereditary characteristics of the Haflinger breed. Member organizations must maintain both a purebred studbook and a separate part-bred studbook for animals with Arabian or other bloodlines.
A strict system of inspection, started in Austria, has evolved to ensure that only good quality stock meeting high standards is used for breeding. This is coupled with close maintenance of the studbook to maintain inspection validity. Mares must be inspected and registered with the stud book before they can be <a href="Horse%20breeding">covered</a>, and multiple forms are needed to prove covering and birth of a purebred Haflinger foal. Within six months of birth, foals are inspected, and those considered to have potential as breeding stock are given certificates of pedigree and branded. Horses are reinspected at three years old, checked against written association standards, and if they pass, are then entered into the studbook. After their final inspection Haflingers from Austria and Italy are <a href="Livestock%20branding">branded</a> with a <a href="branding%20iron">firebrand</a> in the shape of an <a href="edelweiss">edelweiss</a>. Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter "H" in the center of the brand, while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters "HI". Horses are graded based on conformation, action, <a href="Equine%20conformation%23Overall%20balance%20and%20bone">bone</a>, height, temperament and color. Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud book acceptance. Stallions are registered separately. Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree, and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength as well as the other qualifications. Each stallion's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations, as well as records of mares covered, percentages of pregnancies aborted, still-born and live-born, and numbers and genders of foals born. This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding. Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment, and those not chosen must be either <a href="gelding">gelded</a> or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area. The chosen colts are reassessed every six months until a final inspection at the age of three, when the best stallions are chosen for Tyrolean breeding, after which they are purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture and made available for breeding throughout the region. The others are either gelded or sold out of the region. Other countries base their registration and selection practices on Tyrolean ones, as is required by the WHF.

Mom and Dad

Mom and Dad (known as The Family Story in the United Kingdom) is a feature-length 1945 film directed by <a href="William%20Beaudine">William Beaudine</a>, and largely produced by the <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a> maker and presenter <a href="Kroger%20Babb">Kroger Babb</a>. "Mom and Dad" is considered the most successful film within its <a href="genre">genre</a> of "sex hygiene" films. Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the <a href="National%20Legion%20of%20Decency">National Legion of Decency</a>, it became one of the highest-grossing films of the 1940s.

The film is regarded as an exploitation film as it was repackaged controversial content designed to establish an educational value that might circumvent U.S. <a href="censorship">censorship</a> laws. Babb's marketing of his film incorporated old-style <a href="medicine%20show">medicine show</a> techniques, and used unique promotions to build an audience. These formed a template for his later works, which were imitated by his contemporary filmmakers. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The <a href="Academy%20Film%20Archive">Academy Film Archive</a> preserved "Mom and Dad" in 2010.

"Mom and Dad" tells the story of Joan Blake (<a href="June%20Carlson">June Carlson</a>), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell). After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests "<a href="social%20hygiene">hygiene books</a>" from her mother Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married. The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.

The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of "neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth." Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.

The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births – one natural and one Caesarian. In some screenings, a second film was shown along with "Mom and Dad", and contained images portraying <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> and <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>. "Mom and Dad" is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl's child, sometimes <a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a> and other times put up for adoption.


The official credits also acknowledge <a href="The%20Four%20Liphams">The Four Liphams</a> as well as the <a href="California">California</a> State Champion dancers of the <a href="jitterbug">jitterbug</a>.

Despite the commercially successful run of Babb's debut film, "Dust to Dust"—a reworked version of the 1938 film "<a href="Child%20Bride">Child Bride</a>"—his production company <a href="Cox%20and%20Underwood">Cox and Underwood</a> disbanded, forcing him to form his own unit, <a href="Hygienic%20Productions">Hygienic Productions</a>. Having attended a meeting in <a href="Burkburnett%2C%20Texas">Burkburnett, Texas</a>, that discussed the alleged impregnations of young women by <a href="G.I.%20%28military%29">G.I.</a>s from nearby <a href="Sheppard%20Air%20Force%20Base">Sheppard Air Force Base</a>, Babb was inspired to shoot a film based on the subject. His future wife <a href="Mildred%20Horn">Mildred Horn</a> drafted a screenplay which later evolved into "Mom and Dad". Babb located 20 investors willing to fund the movie, and hired <a href="William%20Beaudine">William Beaudine</a> as director.

Production of the film cost Babb and his investors a total of $63,000. The movie was shot in five separate studios over six days in 1944, and was spread across various <a href="Monogram%20Pictures">Monogram Pictures</a> lots; co-producer <a href="J.%20S.%20Jossey">J. S. Jossey</a> was a Monogram stockholder. On January 3, 1945, "Mom and Dad" premiered at the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> theatre in <a href="Oklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</a>.

The plot is padded with a large amount of <a href="filler%20%28media%29">filler</a>. Films of this type were usually produced quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for <a href="feature%20film">feature length</a> status. <a href="Eric%20Schaefer">Eric Schaefer</a> notes that the "primary purpose" of the plot of "Mom and Dad" was to "serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted", such as the live birth scene. The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that "You [will] actually SEE the birth of a baby!" The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> or <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>.

In a "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" article covering Babb's career, the film critic <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> wrote that "Mom and Dad" did not "flourish because of its birth footage or because of its puerile plot, which Babb himself disparages . . . [its] success flowed, rather, from Babb's extraordinary promotional abilities." The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced. In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought to attract the attention of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis. This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own.

The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or Hallmark Productions, and they nominally based their campaign from information provided by a standard and detailed <a href="pressbook">pressbook</a> containing cast and crew information, as well as other <a href="promotion%20%28marketing%29">promotional</a> and marketing materials. Babb's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with advertisements and letters, in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere. In keeping with his motto of "You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em," the film became so ubiquitous that "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote that its presentation "left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life."

The local pitch included a variety of limited screenings, including adults-only showings, viewings segregated by gender, and a live lecture by the "Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes" which was often placed during the intermission. At any one time, a number of "Elliot Forbes"es would give simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film. In some predominantly <a href="African-American">African-American</a> areas, <a href="Olympics">Olympic</a> <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a>ist <a href="Jesse%20Owens">Jesse Owens</a> was hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes. The "Elliot Forbes" actors were usually people local to the production company, sometimes out-of-work performers. Along with "Forbes", presentations were often held with "nurses" in attendance, ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due to the content of the film; such "nurses" were often hired locally.

<a href="Modern%20Film%20Distributors">Modern Film Distributors</a> later distributed the film, and sold over forty-five thousand copies of the books "Man and Boy" and "Woman and Girl" following Forbes's lecture. The text was written by Babb's wife, and was filled with both biological and <a href="sexual%20education">sexual education</a> materials relevant to the film's subject matter; generating extra profit items for their distributors. The sales of these books netted an estimated $31,000 for the distribution company, while Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies.

Babb insisted that the program be followed closely; a contractual agreement with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach. Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing, extra <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>s or <a href="short%20film">short film</a>s were not permitted, although previews were allowed. A contractual agreement disallowed <a href="wikt%3Amatin%C3%A9e">matinée</a> pricing, set specific times for the segregated viewings, and prohibited the screening of the film on Sundays.

"Mom and Dad" is the third highest-grossing film of the 1940s in dollar value, and returned close to $63 for each dollar invested by its backers. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" estimates that the film grossed between $40 million and $100 million, and it has been cited as the most successful sex hygiene film ever released. It remains the most profitable pre-1960 exploitation film; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s and 1950s, even when scaled against those year's mainstream releases.

The film was at the center of many high-profile lawsuits and condemnations. The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly against the <a href="Production%20Code">motion picture censorship system</a>. It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and "Mom and Dad" during the film's run. Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks. One successful challenge was in New York City, where "Mom and Dad" remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as "indecent".

According to Modern Film Distributors, as of the end of 1956, the film has been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide attendance figure of over 175 million people, at over 650,000 performances. <a href="Card%20Mondor">Card Mondor</a> purchased the rights to exhibit the film in New Zealand and Australia during the mid-1960s, almost twenty years after the film's debut. In the late 1970s, a story on Babb by the "<a href="Press-Enterprise">Press-Enterprise</a>" estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages.
The film's success spawned a number of imitators, who sought to saturate the market with genre imitations. In particular, "<a href="Street%20Corner%20%281948%20movie%29">Street Corner</a>" recycled Babb's plot, substituting a concerned <a href="physician">physician</a> for a concerned teacher. In 1948, <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a> produced a similar film, "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Bob%20and%20Sally">The Story of Bob and Sally</a>", but was unable to screen it due to the <a href="production%20code">production code</a>, and eventually sold the rights. The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors, a group of exploitation filmmakers, in an effort to minimize booking conflicts.

In 1969, the film was submitted to the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a> for a <a href="film%20rating">film rating</a>, in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie theaters; it received an <a href="Motion%20picture%20rating%20system%23Restricted">R rating</a>. The film was such a success that it is still shown decades later around the world. In 2005, a version was added to the National Film Registry.

Kroger Babb

Howard W. "Kroger" Babb (December 30, 1906 – January 28, 1980) was an American <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">film</a> and <a href="Television%20in%20the%20United%20States">television</a> producer and <a href="showman">showman</a>. His <a href="film%20marketing">marketing</a> techniques were similar to a travelling salesman's, with roots in the <a href="medicine%20show">medicine-show</a> tradition. Self-described as "America's Fearless Young Showman," he is best known for his presentation of the 1945 <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a> "<a href="Mom%20and%20Dad">Mom and Dad</a>", which was added to the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> of the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> in 2005.

Babb was involved in the production and marketing of many films and television shows, promoting each according to his favorite marketing <a href="motto">motto</a>: "You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em." His films ranged from <a href="sexual%20education">sex education</a>-style dramas to "documentaries" on foreign cultures, intended to titillate audiences rather than to educate them, maximizing profits via marketing gimmicks.

Babb was born in 1906 in <a href="Lees%20Creek%2C%20Ohio">Lees Creek, Ohio</a>, USA (near <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Ohio">Wilmington</a>). He earned the nickname "Kroger" either from his childhood job at the <a href="Kroger">grocer of the same name</a> or from his father's preference for B.H. Kroger coffee. Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in "<a href="Ripley%27s%20Believe%20It%20Or%20Not">Ripley's Believe It Or Not</a>" for <a href="referee">referee</a>ing a record number of youth sports games. He started out with jobs in <a href="sports%20journalism">sportswriting</a> and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing "Digger" O'Dell, the "living corpse," but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners movie theaters, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiences—for example, a drawing to award two bags of groceries to one ticket holder at selected theaters. Another gimmick was to find a furniture store window where a bedroom suite was on display, and there Babb would place a large sign reading "Win a bedroom suit (theatre location & date listed)". This always ensured a packed house, and the "lucky" winner was awarded with a pair of pajamas. These experiences led him to the exploitation film business.

In the early 1940s Babb joined <a href="Cox%20and%20Underwood">Cox and Underwood</a>, a company that obtained the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections of these films and add material such as <a href="medical%20education">medical reels</a> that lent itself to sensational promotion. Babb went on the road with a Cox and Underwood concoction titled "Dust to Dust", a reworking of "High School Girl" with a childbirth scene added to the end. Its profits allowed Cox and Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, <a href="Hygienic%20Productions">Hygienic Productions</a>. He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features.

Babb is best known for his presentation of <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a>s, a term many in the business would embrace. According to "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", his success came from picking topics that would be easily sensationalized, such as religion and sex. His expenses were estimated at 5% for selling, and his distribution overhead near 7%, resulting in some of the largest per-dollar returns in the film industry.

Babb's biggest success was "Mom and Dad," which he conceived and produced and which <a href="William%20Beaudine">William Beaudine</a> directed in six days. Babb headed the promotion of this film following its premiere in early 1945, often going on the road with it himself. The film, a <a href="morality%20tale">morality tale</a> about a young girl who becomes pregnant and struggles to find someone to turn to, cost $62,000 and over 300 prints were struck and sent to theaters all over the country, with a "presenter"—later known as an advance man—and the presenter would stir up his own controversy in the weeks preceding the film's arrival by writing protest letters to local churches and newspapers and fabricating letters from the mayors of nearby cities relating tales of young women encouraged by the film to discuss similar predicaments.

The third highest-grossing film of its decade, "Mom and Dad" was claimed by Babb to have made $63,000 for every $1,000 the original investors contributed, and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million. Its success spawned a number of imitations, such as "<a href="Street%20Corner%20%281948%20film%29">Street Corner</a>" and "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Bob%20and%20Sally">The Story of Bob and Sally</a>", that eventually flooded the market, but it was still being shown around the world decades later and ultimately was added to the National Film Registry in 2005.

The success of "Mom and Dad" was mostly due to Babb's marketing strategy of overwhelming a small town with ads and generating controversy. Eric Schaefer explains:

The film became so ubiquitous that "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" said its presentation "left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life." Babb also made sure that each showing of the film followed a similar format: adults-only screenings segregated by gender, and live lectures by "Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes" during an intermission. At any one time, hundreds of Elliot Forbeses would be giving a lecture at the same time in a variety of locations. (in some predominantly <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> areas, <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic</a> <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a>ist <a href="Jesse%20Owens">Jesse Owens</a> appeared instead, a trend he'd continue with films like ""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"") According to entertainer <a href="Card%20Mondor">Card Mondor</a>, an Elliot Forbes in the 1940s who later purchased the Australian and New Zealand rights for "Mom and Dad," the Forbeses were "mostly local men (from Wilmington, Ohio) who were trained to give the lecture . . . [I]t was a cross-section of the male population, mostly clean-cut young guys . . . The whole concept would have never worked with a trashy look."

During the intermission and after the showing, books relevant to the subject of the film were sold. "Mom and Dad"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> distributor <a href="Modern%20Film%20Distributors">Modern Film Distributors</a> sold over 45,000 copies of "Man and Boy" and "Woman and Girl", written by Babb's wife, netting an estimated $31,000. According to Babb, these cost about eight <a href="Cent%20%28currency%29">cents</a> to produce, and were sold for $1 apiece. While Modern Film was able to sell 45,000 on its own, Babb estimates sales of 40 million, citing "<a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">IRS</a> figures." This sort of companion selling would become common practice for Babb: with the religious film "<a href="The%20Lawton%20Story">The Lawton Story</a> (AKA-Prince of Peace)", he would sell Bibles and other spiritual literature; and with his fidelity film "<a href="Why%20Men%20Leave%20Home">Why Men Leave Home</a>" books featuring beauty tips.

With other films, Babb would try different approaches. For "<a href="She%20Shoulda%20Said%20No%21">She Shoulda Said No!</a>", an anti-<a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> film of the 1950s, he highlighted the sexual scenes and arranged "one-time-only" midnight showings, claiming that his company was working with the United States <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> to release the film "in as many towns and cities as possible in the shortest possible length of time" as a public service. <a href="David%20F.%20Friedman">David F. Friedman</a>, another successful exploitation filmmaker of the era, has attributed the "one-time-only" distribution to a quality so low that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible. At each showing of a film, a singing of "<a href="The%20Star%20Spangled%20Banner">The Star Spangled Banner</a>" was also required.

As well as being at the forefront of the battles over censorship and the <a href="Production%20Code">motion picture censorship system</a>, the exploitation genre faced numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s. It was estimated that Babb was <a href="lawsuit">sued</a> over 400 times just for "Mom and Dad" (Babb himself claimed 428). He would often use the supposed educational value of the films as a defense, also recommending it to theater owners; in his <a href="pressbook">pressbook</a> for "<a href="Karamoja%20%28film%29">Karamoja</a>", he wrote, "When a stupid jerk tries to outsmart proven facts, he should be in an asylum, not a theater."

Despite the criticism that Babb drew for "Mom and Dad," in 1951 he received the first annual <a href="Sid%20Grauman">Sid Grauman</a> Showmanship Award, presented by the Hollywood <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary Club</a> in honor of his accomplishments over the years.

Following the success of "Mom and Dad," Babb renamed his company <a href="Hallmark%20Productions">Hallmark Productions</a>, continuing the marketing approaches of Hygienic Productions while going beyond health and sex education films. He would later set up a larger distribution company, named Hallmark's Big-6.

Babb cheaply acquired the rights to what would become ""<a href="She%20Shoulda%20Said%20No%21">She Shoulda Said No!</a>"" shortly after <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> and <a href="Lila%20Leeds">Lila Leeds</a> were arrested for marijuana use. Its original producer had struggled to get it distributed as "Wild Weed", and Babb quickly presented it as "The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket", hoping that the title would draw audiences. When it failed to stir up much interest, Babb instead focused on the one scene of female nudity, using a photo of Leeds in a <a href="showgirl">showgirl</a> outfit, and retitled it ""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"", with <a href="tagline">tagline</a>s such as "How Bad Can a Good Girl Get . . . without losing her virtue or respect???" According to Friedman, Babb's midnight presentation of the film twice a week made more money than any other film at the same theater would earn over a full run; Friedman proceeded to use the film in his own roadshow double features.

Babb's associates agreed with his belief that "Nothing's hopeless if it's advertised right", stating that he "could take any piece of junk and sell it." One film Babb presented in the 1950s was centered on an annual <a href="passion%20play">passion play</a> and the story behind putting it on, filmed in 1948 in <a href="Lawton%2C%20Oklahoma">Lawton, Oklahoma</a>. Initially called "<a href="The%20Lawton%20Story">The Lawton Story</a>" and filmed in <a href="Cinecolor">Cinecolor</a>, the film was so cheaply, shoddily and quickly made that <a href="telephone%20pole">telephone pole</a>s could be seen behind the <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>. Its cast consisted of local non-professionals whose Oklahoma twangs were so thick that all of their lines had to re-recorded by professional voice-over actors; upon release, one reviewer described it as "the only film that had to be dubbed from English to English." In addition to re-dubbing it, Babb re-edited and re-titled it "The Prince of Peace"; it was so successful that the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" called it "the Miracle of Broadway."

Another film, "<a href="Karamoja%20%28film%29">Karamoja</a>", was marketed as a shocking portrayal of a tribe from <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> who wore "only the wind and live[d] on blood and beer." Scenes included "the bleeding of cattle and drinking of the warm blood, and <a href="self-mutilation">self-mutilation</a> as a form of ornamentation," as well as a full-color <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> scene. "Karamoja" proved less controversial than many of Babb's other films and grossed less.

Babb never repeated the overwhelming success of "Mom and Dad", and he followed much of the exploitation industry in turning to <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> features in an attempt to make more money. One notorious attempt was his acquisition of the American theatrical rights for <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>'s "Sommaren med Monika" ("<a href="Summer%20with%20Monika">Summer with Monika</a>"). About one-third of the film was cut, and the remaining 62 minutes emphasized nudity by retaining a <a href="skinny%20dipping">skinny-dipping</a> scene; the result was titled "Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl." Suggestive advertising art, including promotional postcards, portrayed the nude rear of <a href="Harriet%20Andersson">Harriet Andersson</a>.

Babb's final film was his presentation of a European version of <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s book "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>". This was described by Friedman as one of the most "unintentionally funny exploitation films ever made," filled with "second-rate Italian actors who could barely speak English."

After the success of "Mom and Dad", Babb talked of an "unrealized" project called "Father Bingo", which he advertised in "<a href="Boxoffice%20%28magazine%29">BoxOffice</a>" magazine as "An Expose of Gambling in the <a href="Church%20hall">Parish Halls</a>" and described as a comedy with an anti-gambling message about a corrupt priest who runs a "controlled" <a href="Bingo%20%28U.S.%29">bingo</a> night at his parish. Babb called it "the best 'snow-job' of my life," and it has been speculated that he never intended to make it, despite the trade ads that appeared for years.

Babb was involved with many film production companies along with his own, including Southwestern Productions. On the strength of his past successes, Babb joined <a href="John%20Miller%20%28film%29">John Miller</a>'s film production company, <a href="Miller-Consolidated%20Pictures">Miller-Consolidated Pictures</a>, as vice president and <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> in 1959. Babb advocated the use of the <a href="soft%20sell">hard-selling</a> technique he had perfected as a presenter: "selling the sizzle instead of the steak", according to an interview. He wrote a column for "BoxOffice" at the same time. His personal anecdotes provided advice for selling films, such as writing off expenses as <a href="tax%20deduction">tax deduction</a>s, and using <a href="List%20of%20women%27s%20organizations">women's clubs</a> to expand advertising and revenues cheaply. He noted that there were "over 30,000 women's clubs," and that "practically every women's club has a <a href="16%20mm%20film">16mm</a> <a href="movie%20projector">projector</a>."

In 1963 Babb formed another distribution company, <a href="Studio%2010%2C001%20Inc.">Studio 10,001</a>. Operating in <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills</a> (and claiming representation in Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand), it used similar roadshow techniques to market television programs such as "<a href="Ern%20Westmore">The Ern Westmore Show</a>". Babb also acted as a showman for hire, promoting others' films when not working on his own. Among them was a <a href="nudie-cutie">nudie-cutie</a> picture titled "Kipling's Women", a <a href="peep%20show">peep show</a>, and "<a href="Five%20Minutes%20to%20Love">Five Minutes to Love</a>", a reworking of a <a href="Rue%20McClanahan">Rue McClanahan</a> film.

Babb began creating promotion kits entitled "Who's Got the Ball?" in an attempt to teach his craft to would-be presenters. Marketing himself as "MR. PIHSNAMWOHS" ("showmanship" backwards), he advertised in "BoxOffice". He also dabbled in other areas, writing tirades against pay television and creating a <a href="pyramid%20scheme">pyramid scheme</a> titled "The Idea Factory." One of his schemes was the "Astounding Swedish Ice Cream Diet": overweight throughout his life, Babb claimed to have eaten <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a> three times a day, yet to have lost 100 pounds in 45 days.

Babb met <a href="Mildred%20Horn">Mildred Horn</a> in 1944 during a showing of "Dust to Dust" in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, where she was working as a <a href="film%20criticism">movie critic</a>; her review of the film called it a "cheap, mislabeled <a href="morality%20play">morality play</a>," but the two struck up a conversation about it. They stayed together in a <a href="common-law%20marriage">common-law marriage</a>; Horn wrote a number of Babb's screenplays, including "Mom and Dad", as well as companion books.

In November 1953 Babb was arrested on a <a href="drunk%20driving">drunk-driving</a> charge after running a red <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a> and refusing a <a href="Field%20Sobriety%20Test%23Field%20sobriety%20tests">sobriety test</a>. His $250 bail was <a href="continuance">continued</a>, and he was not convicted, although this mishap to the recent creator of the anti-alcohol film "<a href="One%20Too%20Many">One Too Many</a>" was widely covered in the press.

Babb had tax troubles in the years after his success with "Mom and Dad". He suggested to the "Press-Enterprise" that his operation was so diffuse that sales of his one-dollar sex education <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s were too difficult to track accurately. Babb eventually sold the rights to "Mom and Dad" and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Erwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis—former partners in Modern Film who would continue to showcase "Mom and Dad" across the United States.

Babb suffered from various ailments toward the end of his life, including a stroke. He retired in 1977, at 70, and died of heart failure (due to complications from <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>) on January 29, 1980, in <a href="Palm%20Springs%2C%20California">Palm Springs, California</a>. His gravestone reads, "His many trips around and all over the world began in Centerville and end here in Lees Creek."

Babb worked in various areas of the entertainment industry, in both traditional and exploitation genres. He claimed to have made twenty films, and produced for television, radio, and even the stage. This is an incomplete collection of works owing to the nature of the exploitation genre. The titles are as they were finally presented by Babb, with earlier titles noted in parentheses.

Residuated lattice

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a residuated lattice is an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> that is simultaneously a <a href="lattice%20%28order%29">lattice</a> "x" ≤ "y" and a <a href="monoid">monoid</a> "x"•"y" which admits operations "x"\"z" and "z"/"y", loosely analogous to division or implication, when "x"•"y" is viewed as multiplication or conjunction, respectively. Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative. The general concept was introduced by <a href="Morgan%20Ward">Morgan Ward</a> and <a href="Robert%20P.%20Dilworth">Robert P. Dilworth</a> in 1939. Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a>s, <a href="Heyting%20algebra">Heyting algebra</a>s, <a href="residuated%20Boolean%20algebra">residuated Boolean algebra</a>s, <a href="relation%20algebra">relation algebra</a>s, and <a href="MV-algebra">MV-algebra</a>s. <a href="Residuated%20lattice%23Residuated%20semilattice">Residuated semilattices</a> omit the meet operation ∧, for example <a href="Kleene%20algebra">Kleene algebra</a>s and <a href="action%20algebra">action algebra</a>s.

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a residuated lattice is an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> L = ("L", ≤, •, I) such that

In (iii), the "greatest "y"", being a function of "z" and "x", is denoted "x"\"z" and called the right residual of "z" by "x". Think of it as what remains of "z" on the right after "dividing" "z" on the left by "x". Dually, the "greatest "x"" is denoted "z"/"y" and called the left residual of "z" by "y". An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is

(iii)' for all "x", "y", "z" in "L",   "y" ≤ "x"\"z"   ⇔   "x"•"y" ≤ "z"   ⇔   "x" ≤ "z"/"y".

As suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient. More precisely, for a given "x" in "L", the unary operations "x"• and "x"\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a <a href="Galois%20connection">Galois connection</a> on L, and dually for the two functions •"y" and /"y". By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,

together with the requirement that "x"•"y" be monotone in "x" and "y". (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.) These give a sense in which the functions "x"• and "x"\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •"x" and /"x".

This last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as "x"•"y" ≤ ("x"∨"z")•"y" and similarly for the other operations and their arguments. Moreover, any inequality "x" ≤ "y" can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either "x"∧"y" = "x" or "x"∨"y" = "y". This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature ("L", ≤, •, I) thereby expanding it to ("L", ∧, ∨, •, I, /, \). When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or <a href="Variety%20%28universal%20algebra%29">variety</a>, whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations. Note that distributivity "x"•("y" ∨ "z") = ("x"•"y") ∨ ("x"•"z") and "x"•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition. This necessary distributivity of • over ∨ does not in general entail distributivity of ∧ over ∨, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice. However distributivity of ∧ over ∨ is entailed when • and ∧ are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a <a href="Heyting%20algebra">Heyting algebra</a>.
Alternative notations for "x"•"y" include "x"◦"y", "x";"y" (<a href="relation%20algebra">relation algebra</a>), and "x"⊗"y" (<a href="linear%20logic">linear logic</a>). Alternatives for I include "e" and 1'. Alternative notations for the residuals are "x" → "y" for "x"\"y" and "y" ← "x" for "y"/"x", suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative. When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide. When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: "x"•"y" means "x" "and then" "y",   "x" → "y" means "had" "x" (in the past) "then" "y" (now),   and "y" ← "x" means "if-ever" "x" (in the future) "then" "y" (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.

One of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a> of a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>. Given a ring "R", the ideals of "R", denoted Id("R"), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and "ideal addition" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by "ideal multiplication", and the element "R" of Id("R") acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals "A" and "B" in Id("R"), the residuals are given by
It is worth noting that {0}/"B" and "B"\{0} are respectively the left and right <a href="annihilator%20%28ring%20theory%29">annihilators</a> of "B". This residuation is related to the "<a href="conductor%20%28ring%20theory%29">conductor</a>" (or "transporter") in <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a> written as ("A":"B")="A"/"B". One difference in usage is that "B" need not be an ideal of "R": it may just be a subset.

<a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a>s and <a href="Heyting%20algebras">Heyting algebras</a> are commutative residuated lattices in which "x"•"y" = "x"∧"y" (whence the unit I is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals "x"\"y" and "y"/"x" are the same operation, namely implication "x" → "y". The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite <a href="distributive%20lattice">distributive lattice</a>s, as well as all chains or <a href="total%20order">total order</a>s forming a <a href="complete%20lattice">complete lattice</a>, for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±formula_3.

The structure (Z, "min", "max", +, 0, −, −) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice. In this example the inequalities are equalities because − (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse. Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example. The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided "min" and "max" are interchanged and − is replaced by <a href="monus">monus</a>, defined (in this case) so that "x"-"y" = 0 when "x" ≤ "y" and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.

A more general class of examples is given by the <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a> of all <a href="binary%20relations">binary relations</a> on a set "X", namely the power set of "X", made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation I on "X" consisting of all pairs ("x","x") for "x" in "X". Given two relations "R" and "S" on "X", the right residual "R"\"S" of "S" by "R" is the binary relation such that "x"("R"\"S")"y" holds just when for all "z" in "X", "zRx" implies "zSy" (notice the connection with implication). The left residual is the mirror image of this: "y"("S"/"R")"x" holds just when for all "z" in "X", "xRz" implies "ySz".

This can be illustrated with the binary relations < and > on {0,1} in which 0 < 1 and 1 > 0 are the only relationships that hold. Then "x"(>\<)"y" holds just when "x" = 1, while "x"(</>)"y" holds just when "y" = 0, showing that residuation of < by > is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left. This difference is a consequence of the difference between <•> and >•<, where the only relationships that hold are 0(<•>)0 (since 0<1>0) and 1(>•<)1 (since 1>0<1). Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of < and >, ≥\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all "x" and "y" (since "x"≤1≥"y" and "x"≥0≤"y").

The Boolean algebra 2 of all <a href="formal%20language">formal language</a>s over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation "LM" and whose monoid unit I is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε. The right residual "M"\"L" consists of all words "w" over Σ such that "Mw" ⊆ "L". The left residual "L"/"M" is the same with "wM" in place of "Mw".

The residuated lattice of all binary relations on "X" is finite just when "X" is finite, and commutative just when "X" has at most one element. When "X" is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = I. The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter. It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit I = {ε} = 1.

The examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on <a href="residuated%20Boolean%20algebra">residuated Boolean algebra</a>s.

In <a href="natural%20language">natural language</a> residuated lattices formalize the logic of "and" when used with its noncommutative meaning of "and then." Setting "x" = "bet", "y" = "win", "z" = "rich", we can read "x"•"y" ≤ "z" as "bet and then win entails rich." By the axioms this is equivalent to "y" ≤ "x"→"z" meaning "win entails had bet then rich", and also to "x" ≤ "z"←"y" meaning "bet entails if-ever win then rich." Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as "bet entails had win then rich" and "win entails if-ever bet then rich" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking "win and then bet entails rich." Humans do not so readily detect that <a href="Peirce%27s%20law">Peirce's law</a> (("P"→"Q")→"P")→"P" is a classical <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautology</a>, an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with non-classical reasoning than classical (for example, in <a href="relevance%20logic">relevance logic</a>, Peirce's law is not a tautology).

A residuated semilattice is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation ∧. Thus it is an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol ∧. The option of defining "x" ≤ "y" as "x"∧"y" = "x" is then not available, leaving only the other option "x"∨"y" = "y" (or any equivalent thereof).

Any residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting ∧. Residuated semilattices arise in connection with <a href="action%20algebra">action algebra</a>s, which are residuated semilattices that are also <a href="Kleene%20algebra">Kleene algebra</a>s, for which ∧ is ordinarily not required.

The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II

The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. It is based on the fantasy novels "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and "<a href="The%20Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>" by <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and its <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">live-action film trilogy</a> adaptation. It is the sequel to Electronic Arts' 2004 title "". The <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> version of the game was released on March 2, 2006 and the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> version was released on July 5, 2006. Along with the standard edition, a <a href="special%20edition">Collector's Edition</a> of the game was released, containing bonus material and a documentary about the game's development. The official <a href="game%20server">game server</a>s were shut down for Windows in 2010 and Xbox 360 in 2011, however Windows users may still play online using unofficial <a href="game%20server">game server</a>s.

The story for "The Battle for Middle-earth II" is divided into Good and Evil Campaigns. The Good Campaign focuses on <a href="Glorfindel">Glorfindel</a>, an <a href="Elf%20%28Middle-earth%29">Elf</a> who is alerted to a planned attack on the Elven sanctuary of <a href="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. With help from the <a href="Dwarf%20%28Middle-earth%29">Dwarves</a> and other Good forces, the Elves attempt to eliminate <a href="Sauron">Sauron</a> and his army to restore peace in <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>. In the Evil Campaign, Sauron sends the <a href="Mouth%20of%20Sauron">Mouth of Sauron</a> and the <a href="Nazg%C3%BBl">Nazgûl</a> to muster wild <a href="Orc%20%28Middle-earth%29">Goblins</a>. With his army, Sauron moves forward with his plan to destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.

"The Battle for Middle-earth II" received generally favorable reviews from video game critics. Reviews praised the game's integration of the "Lord of the Rings" universe into a real-time strategy title, while criticism targeted the game's unbalanced multiplayer mode. "The Battle for Middle-earth II" received numerous awards, including the Editors' Choice Award from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. At the end of March 2006, "The Battle for Middle-earth II" reached fourth in a list of the month's best-selling PC games. A Windows <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> for the game was released on November 28, 2006, called "", which features a new faction known as <a href="Angmar">Angmar</a>, new units, and several gameplay improvements.

"The Battle for Middle-earth II" is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game. Similar to , the game requires that the player build a base with structures to produce units, gather resources, research upgrades, and provide defenses. Units are used to attack the enemy and defend the player's base. Players win matches by eliminating all enemy unit producing structures. Unlike the first game, the player can build an unlimited number of structures anywhere on the map, allowing for more freedom in base building and unit production. Players can build walls to defend their base; however, the walls can only be constructed within a certain proximity to the players fortress. They can also construct arrow and catapult towers on building plots around a fortress to provide defensive support and basic protection. Along with this, each factions' fortress is uniquely equipped with a special power reached only by purchasing necessary upgrades. The game's <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">HUD</a>, called the <a href="Palant%C3%ADr">Palantír</a>, shows the player's hero units and their abilities, a <a href="mini-map">mini-map</a>, and objectives.

Units are classified into one of several classes: <a href="infantry">infantry</a>, <a href="Archery">ranged</a>, <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pikemen</a>, <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>, or <a href="Siege%20engine">siege</a>. Each unit class has unique strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of properly matching up units in battle to increase their effectiveness. Hero units are unique in that only one of each can be created; they consist of characters from the novel, such as <a href="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>, <a href="Legolas">Legolas</a>, <a href="Gimli%20%28Middle-earth%29">Gimli</a>, <a href="Saruman">Saruman</a>, <a href="Nazg%C3%BBl">Nazgûl</a>, <a href="Mouth%20of%20Sauron">Mouth of Sauron</a>, <a href="Arwen">Arwen</a> and <a href="Shelob">Shelob</a>, or are created via the game's Hero Creator (only accessible via the PC version). If the player kills <a href="Gollum">Gollum</a>, a <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>, they are rewarded with the <a href="One%20Ring">One Ring</a>. The item can be used to summon one of two ring heroes for a price of 10,000 resources, <a href="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> and <a href="Sauron">Sauron</a>, depending on the player's faction. Ring heroes have extremely strong armor and powerful attacks, making them among the game's most over-powered units.

The War of the Ring mode carried over from the first game in the series combines <a href="turn-based%20strategy">turn-based strategy</a> elements with <a href="Real-time%20strategy">real-time skirmishes</a>. <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a> is divided into territories; players can construct buildings to produce troops only in a claimed territory. During each turn, the player can move their armies into neutral and enemy territories to take control of them. While neutral territories are conquered by simply entering them, enemy territories must be wrested from the other player by defeating them in a skirmish. Troops can be garrisoned in conquered territories to defend against enemy attacks. When the player chooses to attack another territory, or one of their territories is being invaded by an enemy, they can either simulate the match and let the computer determine the outcome, or play the match by commanding the units in real time. The winner of the skirmish gains the territory, and all surviving units gain <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s. To win the game, players must either control the enemy's capital territory, or take over a given number of territories in Middle-earth.

"The Battle for Middle-earth II" introduces three new factions with unique units and heroes: <a href="Orc%20%28Middle-earth%29">Goblins</a>, <a href="Dwarf%20%28Middle-earth%29">Dwarves</a>, and <a href="Elf%20%28Middle-earth%29">Elves</a>. <a href="Rohan%20%28Middle-earth%29">Rohan</a> and <a href="Gondor">Gondor</a> are combined into one faction called <a href="D%C3%BAnedain">Men of the West</a>. Along with <a href="Mordor">Mordor</a> and <a href="Isengard">Isengard</a> from , there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the <a href="Rohan%20%28Middle-earth%29%23People">Rohirrim</a> of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from a distance, and their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of <a href="melee">melee</a> and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes goblins, trolls, spiders, and dragons, which are effective in large numbers. Their only advantage is that the goblin archer and soldier units are cheap to make at only 75 resources and build faster than other basic infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained <a href="Uruk-hai">Uruk-hai</a> under <a href="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks and the ability to throw boulders or wield trees like swords.

Set in the regions of northern <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, the game focuses on the events of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Ring%23Northern%20Theatre">War in the North</a>. For the sake of gameplay, the game takes several liberties with Tolkien's works and the film trilogy. Some characters were altered in their appearances, abilities, and roles; for instance, a combat role in the game is given to <a href="Tom%20Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a>, a merry and mysterious hermit who appears in "The Lord of the Rings" but does not take part in the war. In addition, Tolkien's earlier novel "<a href="The%20Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>" lends several elements to the game, including characters such as the <a href="Giant%20Spider%20%28Middle%20Earth%29">Giant Spider</a>s from <a href="Mirkwood">Mirkwood</a>. The story for "The Battle for Middle-earth II" is divided into Good and Evil Campaigns. Both campaigns focus on the battles fought by the newly introduced factions: the Elves, Dwarves, and Goblins. The player goes through nine fixed missions in either easy, medium, or hard difficulty mode. Narrated <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s provide plot exposition between missions.

The Evil Campaign follows an alternative version of the War in the North. Sauron sends the <a href="Mouth%20of%20Sauron">Mouth of Sauron</a> and the <a href="Nazg%C3%BBl">Nazgûl</a> to the North to muster wild Goblins. His lieutenants lead the Goblin army and launch an assault on the Elven forest of <a href="Lothl%C3%B3rien">Lórien</a>. Despite heavy resistance, the forest is overrun, with <a href="Celeborn">Celeborn</a> slain and <a href="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> having fled to <a href="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>; even <a href="Caras%20Galadhon">Caras Galadhon</a> collapses under the sheer force of the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured <a href="Mirror%20of%20Galadriel">Mirror of Galadriel</a> for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty ancient stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by the Goblin King Gorkil, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed and captured, and the march across Eriador begins; <a href="Hobbit">Hobbit</a>s of the <a href="Shire%20%28Middle-earth%29">Shire</a> are chosen as the next target. Gorkil's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but <a href="Saruman">Saruman's</a> servant <a href="Gr%C3%ADma%20Wormtongue">Gríma Wormtongue</a>, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard <a href="Uruk-hai">Uruks</a> and claims the land for his master. The Goblins annihilate the well-trained army and kill Wormtongue, taking the Shire for themselves.

Gorkil continues marching west and besieges <a href="Fornost">Fornost</a>, the fortified ruins of the ancient capitol of Arnor. The defenders, consisting of the <a href="D%C3%BAnedain">Dúnedain</a> and Dwarves led by Glóin, crumble under the relentless Goblin attacks, and Eriador falls under Goblin control. Sauron launches a concurrent campaign east of the <a href="Misty%20Mountains">Misty Mountains</a>. The orcs from Dol Guldur eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the Forest Road in Mirkwood, defeating the Elven lord Thranduil. After the fall of Mirkwood, the Mouth of Sauron leads his horde to Withered Heath to recruit the Dragon Lord Drogoth, after destroying the Dwarves in the area. To finally rid Sauron and Middle Earth of the Dwarves, The Mouth of Sauron attacks the human city of Dale and the Dwarven stronghold of Erebor, led by King Dain. For the final battle against the Good factions in the North, the Goblin horde and Sauron's forces from Mordor converge at Rivendell, the last surviving stronghold against Sauron in Middle-earth. Eagles, the <a href="Dead%20Men%20of%20Dunharrow">Dead Men of Dunharrow</a>, <a href="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> and her surviving Elves, and the remnants of the <a href="Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring%20%28characters%29">Fellowship of the Ring</a> arrive to help Arwen and Elrond, but Sauron (having attained full power through recovering the One Ring from the dead <a href="Frodo%20Baggins">Frodo</a>) and all his gathered forces enter the battle and completely destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.

The Good Campaign opens after the <a href="Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring%20%28characters%29">Fellowship of the Ring</a> has set out on their mission to unmake the <a href="One%20Ring">One Ring of Power</a>, with <a href="Elrond">Elrond</a> and <a href="Gl%C3%B3in">Glóin</a> planning the War in the North. The Elven hero <a href="Glorfindel">Glorfindel</a> discovers an impending attack on the Elven sanctuary of <a href="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. Thanks to the early warning, Elrond's forces in Rivendell manage to repel the Goblins' attacks. Following the battle, Elrond realizes that the Elves and Dwarves must join forces to purge the threat of <a href="Sauron">Sauron's</a> forces in the North. The next battle takes place in the Goblin capital of <a href="Ettenmoors">Ettenmoors</a>, where the Goblin fortress is destroyed, and Gorkil the Goblin King is killed. After their victory, the heroes are informed that the Goblins, on Sauron's command, enlisted the service of a <a href="Dragon%20%28Middle-earth%29">Dragon</a> named Drogoth who is laying waste to the Dwarves of the <a href="Ered%20Luin">Blue Mountains</a>. The heroes make their way to the Blue Mountains and help the Dwarven army defeat Drogoth and his Goblins.

The <a href="Grey%20Havens">Grey Havens</a>, an Elven port on the western shores, is attacked by the <a href="Corsairs%20of%20Umbar">Corsairs of Umbar</a>, allies of Sauron. The Dwarves, who have been reluctant to ally with the Elves, eventually decide to come to the aid of the Grey Havens. With the Goblins defeated and all of <a href="Eriador">Eriador</a> pacified, the Dwarven-Elven alliance is tested by Sauron's forces. Mordor's overwhelming forces besiege the Lake Town of <a href="Esgaroth">Esgaroth</a> and the Dwarven city of <a href="Erebor">Erebor</a>. The Dwarven king <a href="D%C3%A1in%20II%20Ironfoot">Dáin</a> leads a small group of Dwarves and men of <a href="Minor%20places%20in%20Middle-earth%23D%29">Dale</a> to defend their homeland and manage to eliminate the Mordor presence in Esgaroth but are forced to retreat back to Erebor to defend themselves against an overwhelming army led by the <a href="Mouth%20of%20Sauron">Mouth of Sauron</a>. After a long battle against the Mouth of Sauron's army, Elven reinforcements from Mirkwood led by the Elven king <a href="Thranduil">Thranduil</a> arrive and save the Dwarves, defeating the Mouth of Sauron and his army. Elrond leads the first attack, but later, <a href="Thranduil">Thranduil</a>, <a href="Glorfindel">Glorfindel</a>, <a href="Gl%C3%B3in">Glóin</a>, <a href="Arwen">Arwen</a>, and King Dáin all unite under the Dwarven-Elven alliance for a final battle in <a href="Dol%20Guldur">Dol Guldur</a>, the stronghold of Sauron in Mirkwood, aided by the <a href="Ent">Ent</a>s and <a href="Eagle%20%28Middle-earth%29">Eagles</a>. The Good forces and its three combined armies overcome the defenses and destroy the fortress, eliminating the last threat in the North.

<a href="Tolkien%20Enterprises">Tolkien Enterprises</a> granted the publisher of "The Battle for Middle-earth II", <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>, the rights to develop "The Lord of the Games" video games based on "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" books on July 22, 2005. This agreement was complementary to a separate arrangement made between the two companies in 2001. That agreement gave Electronic Arts the rights to build video games based on <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">"The Lord of the Rings" film trilogy</a>. The new deal gives Electronic Arts the opportunity to create video games with original stories tied closely with the "Lord of the Rings" universe. In the same announcement, Electronic Arts revealed two games that its <a href="EA%20Los%20Angeles">EA Los Angeles</a> division would be developing with the license: "The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II" for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>—a sequel to ""—and "" for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>.

On November 10, 2005, Electronic Arts announced that <a href="Hugo%20Weaving">Hugo Weaving</a>, who played <a href="Elrond">Elrond</a> in the "Lord of the Rings" film trilogy, would reprise his role as Elrond and be the lead voiceover talent in "The Battle for Middle-earth II". During his voiceover session, he noted, "I always find voice work really fascinating because you are working on one element of your make up as an actor—focusing more intently on one part of your toolbox if you like—in a way so everything seems to go into producing that vocal effect. It really isn’t just an effect, because it actually comes from a source which is a true continuation of that character."

On January 13, 2006, Electronic Arts reported that an <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> version of "The Battle for Middle-earth II" was under development, and it was promised to feature a "unique and intuitive control scheme" developed by video game designer <a href="Louis%20Castle">Louis Castle</a>, co-founder of the <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> developer <a href="Westwood%20Studios">Westwood Studios</a>. Players would be able to play online via the <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> service. Castle was excited to port the game to a console, stating, "Living these cinematic battles in high-definition with stunning surround sound, all from the comfort of your living room couch on the Xbox 360, is an extraordinary experience. [...] Adding the ability to battle it out with friends via Xbox Live is also really exciting."

The game's water effects received substantial upgrades because of the large role naval battles play in "The Battle for Middle-earth II". The developers endeavored to make the surface of oceans and lakes look realistic by using techniques similar to those applied in films when creating computer-generated ocean water. The digital water simulates deep ocean water by reflecting its surroundings on the surface, and wave technology was used to create large waves along coastlines to immerse the player in the game experience. Lost towns, corals, and fish were added underwater to add to the effect. Water was chosen as the first graphical component of "The Battle for Middle-earth II" to take advantage of <a href="DirectX">DirectX</a> 9 programmable <a href="shader">shader</a>s. These additions were part of an overall Electronic Arts strategy to continue the "Lord of the Rings" experience that began with the trilogy film series.

As cinematic director of "The Battle for Middle-earth II", Richard Taylor was responsible for designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from "The Lord of the Rings" universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually for the first time in the game's <a href="cut%20scenes">cut scenes</a>. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was pleased to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.

The game was released by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> on March 2, 2006 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and July 5, 2006 for <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. Electronic Arts released a <a href="special%20edition">Collector's Edition</a> that includes a bonus DVD with supplemental high-definition media such as the full original music score; in-game cinematics and trailers; the documentary "The Making of The Battle for Middle-earth II"; and "The Art of the Game", a gallery featuring hundreds of cinematic paintings and concept art created for the game.

It was given generally favorable reviews, receiving an aggregated score of 84% at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> for its Windows version. Praise focused on its successful integration of the "Lord of the Rings" franchise with the real-time strategy genre, while criticism targeted the game's unbalanced multiplayer mode. "The Battle for Middle-earth II" was given the Editor's Choice Award from IGN. At the end of its debut month of March 2006, "The Battle for Middle-earth II" reached fourth in a list of the month's best-selling PC games, while the Collector's Edition peaked at eighth place. In the second month after the game's release, "The Battle for Middle-earth II" was the 12th best-selling PC game, despite a 10% slump in overall game sales for that month. The game's computer version received a "Silver" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

After playing the game, "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" found little fault with it, calling it a very well-balanced game overall. The magazine also was pleased that the game's "production values [were] sky-high", with which <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> agreed, explaining, "It's not often you come across an RTS with production values this high; every part seems to be polished till it shines." When compared to its predecessor, "", "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" was convinced "The Battle for Middle-earth II" had improved upon the original in several fundamental ways. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> believed that "The Battle for Middle-earth II" offered better gameplay and a much broader scope that encompassed more of <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>.

Several critics praised the game's real-time strategy elements and graphics. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> considered the high quality of "The Battle for Middle-earth II" proof that Electronic Arts was truly interested in building great real-time strategy games. Despite a few minor issues, GameZone was happy with the gameplay of "The Battle for Middle-earth II", believing that the game did a good job of enabling the player to experience the turmoil of the fantasy world. They also admired the game's conversion for the Xbox 360 version, calling it "one of the best PC-to-console conversions" and praising the developers for a "commendable job of assigning actions to the 360 controller’s eight buttons". The graphics were appreciated by ActionTrip, which found it "really hard not to drool over this game", commending the game's design and art team for doing a fabulous job on every location that appeared in the single-player campaign.

Playing within the universe of "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" was appealing to a number of reviewers, which found that it generally increased the game's entertainment value. "PC Gamer" shared this sentiment, calling "Lord of the Rings" "arguably the best fantasy universe ever", and GameZone asked the question, "What self-respecting Tolkien fan can be without this title?" The results also pleased <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, which was convinced that fans of "The Lord of the Rings" could not afford to miss purchasing the game. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> complimented the game's merge with the "Lord of the Rings" universe, observing that the franchise's mythology and the game's frenetic battles came together in a very satisfying bundle. The integration of "The Lord of the Rings" into a video game satisfied "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>", and the magazine predicted the game would be "another winner for Electronic Arts".

Despite positive reactions, reviewers brought up several issues with the game. The British video game publication "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>" was unhappy with the game, claiming that Electronic Arts chose to release a formulaic game because it was a safer choice than taking "The Battle for Middle-earth II" in another direction. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" agreed with this view, claiming that although the game looked impressive, it took a by-the-numbers approach towards the real-time strategy genre in a "mindless sort of way", concluding that "in no way is it anywhere near the game we hoped for." The game's multiplayer portion disappointed <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, which found it too unbalanced compared to the heroes, whom they considered to be too strong. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> considered the game to be of average quality, noting that there were no truly redeeming qualities.

The editors of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" named "The Battle for Middle-earth 2" the third-best computer game of 2006, and called it "undeniably a labor of love, a grand work of art and strategy."

The Smithsonian American Art Museum selected "The Battle for Middle-earth 2" as one of 80 games spanning the past 40 years to be a part of "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Video%20Games">The Art of Video Games</a>" exhibit that ran from March, 2012 to September 2012 in Washington, DC.

Electronic Arts announced on July 27, 2006 that its EA Los Angeles studio would be releasing an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> to "The Battle for Middle-earth II" titled "". It was slated for release during the 2006 holiday season. The game, produced by Amir Rahimi, promised players the opportunity to fight in wars that precedes the events of the "Lord of the Rings" novels. "The Rise of the Witch-king" adds a new single-player campaign, new units, a new faction, and improved features. Its story follows the <a href="Witch-king%20of%20Angmar">Witch-king of Angmar</a>'s "ascent to power, his domination of <a href="Angmar">Angmar</a>, and eventual invasion of <a href="Arnor">Arnor</a>, <a href="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>'s ancestral home". The game was <a href="Gold%20release">sent to manufacturers</a> on November 15, 2006, and was released on November 28.

On January 9, 2011, Electronic Arts announced that the online game servers would be shut down on January 11, 2011 for the Xbox 360 format of the game. The PC version of the game was shut down on December 31, 2010. Electronic Arts noted that their discontinuation of support for the game was partly because the licensing deal with New Line Cinema (holders of the "Lord of the Rings" license) had expired, which led them to no other option than to shut down all online services for the game.

Charles Atangana

Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), also known by his birth name, Ntsama, and his <a href="German%20name">German name</a>, Karl, was the <a href="paramount%20chief">paramount chief</a> of the <a href="Beti-Pahuin">Ewondo and Bane</a> ethnic groups during much of the <a href="History%20of%20Cameroon">colonial period</a> in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with <a href="List%20of%20Christian%20missions%20in%20Africa">colonial priests</a> and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the <a href="German%20colonial%20empire">colonial government</a>. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two <a href="Beti-Pahuin">Beti-Pahuin</a> subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana returned to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a> territory under the administration of the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French Third Republic</a>. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the <a href="Westernization">Westernisation</a> of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the Europeans as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.

Atangana was born sometime between 1876 and 1885 in <a href="Mvoly%C3%A9">Mvolyé</a>, a small village in what is today <a href="Yaound%C3%A9">Yaoundé</a>, Cameroon. His parents gave him the <a href="talking%20drum">drum name</a> "He who is known by the nations". He was the eleventh of twelve children born to Essomba Atangana, a <a href="village%20head">headman</a> of the Mvog Atemenge sublineage of the Ewondo ethnic group. Essomba Atangana was one of thousands of minor <a href="Beti-Pahuin">Beti</a> leaders living between the <a href="Sanaga%20River">Sanaga</a> and <a href="Nyong%20River">Nyong</a> rivers, each charged with providing for his compound and the extended family and slaves who lived there. His father died when Ntsama Atangana was about six years old.

Little is known about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would have learned to fish, hunt, and trap, and would have memorised his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> appeared near his village in 1887 in search of a direct route to the <a href="ivory%20trade">ivory trade</a> in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their <a href="Kamerun">Kamerun</a> colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed the foreigners at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of <a href="Omgba%20Bissogo">Omgba Bissogo</a> in 1895 and others like it, Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve under them, and took local youths to perform menial tasks; Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.

Ewondo who learned were highly favoured in the early days of the colonial regime. Station commander <a href="Hans%20Dominik%20%28Schutztruppe%29">Hans Dominik</a> sent four such individuals to attend the <a href="missionary">mission</a> school of the German <a href="Pallottine%20mission%20to%20Kamerun">Pallottine Fathers</a> in <a href="Kribi">Kribi</a>, a settlement on the coast. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>. Father <a href="Heinrich%20Vieter">Heinrich Vieter</a> especially liked the boy, and Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the <a href="given%20name">Christian name</a> Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended when members of the Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899. Atangana waited out the revolt in <a href="Douala">Douala</a> with the Fathers until the colonial militia defeated the rebels the following year.

In August 1900, the commander of German forces at Victoria (present-day <a href="Limbe%2C%20Cameroon">Limbe</a>) appointed Atangana <a href="interpreting">interpreter</a> for 500 Bulu hostages, who were being pressed into <a href="unfree%20labour">labour</a>. Atangana kept the post for six months and took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to <a href="Buea">Buea</a> to work as an office <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a>. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was a little older and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.

Atangana was a devout Christian, and he supported the church throughout his life with land and gifts. He opposed popular Beti <a href="syncretism">syncretist</a> practices, and he was an opponent of an Ewondo initiation rite called the "<a href="Sso%20%28rite%29">Sso</a>"; his efforts led to its eventual eradication from Beti society. In 1901 he secured land for the Pallottine Fathers to build a mission in Jaunde, thus opening East and South Kamerun to Catholic <a href="Proselytism">proselytisation</a>. Nevertheless, Atangana supported traditional Ewondo customs on marriage. On widows, he said,My colleagues and I . . . can only reply in demanding the upholding of custom, which requires the widow to be the property of the heir until her liberation, which can only take effect after the return of her bridewealth. She must remain with him as long as this return is not made.

Early in 1902, the colonial government appointed him their representative to the Ewondo people, and interpreter and clerk for the Germans posted in Jaunde. He was tasked with organising a census and tax collection system. He chose 300 headmen to be tax collectors, of whom the Germans approved 233. Atangana negotiated a cut of 5% for the collectors, much to their delight.

Hans Dominik became the Jaunde post commander in 1904. For the next six years, Atangana accompanied him on at least fifteen administrative patrols and probative excursions. Atangana proved an astute diplomat, in one case negotiating with a group of rebellious <a href="Beti-Pahuin">Manguissa</a> and thus averting a confrontation between the tribesmen and the Germans. Atangana helped open posts in such wide-ranging places as <a href="Bafia">Bafia</a>, <a href="Abong-Mbang">Abong-Mbang</a>, <a href="Mouloudou">Mouloudou</a>, <a href="Ngaound%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Ngaoundéré</a>, <a href="Garoua">Garoua</a>, and <a href="Maroua">Maroua</a>. The Germans largely kept themselves segregated from their African subjects, but Dominik and Atangana defied these standards and grew close, even dining together in the same tent on occasion. Back in Jaunde, Atangana gained responsibilities valued by the regime, such as overseeing a <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll tax</a> in October 1908.

In 1907, members of the Mvog Ada sublineage revolted against the colonial government over Atangana's appointment as their official interpreter. The plot included a conspiracy to poison Atangana, but word leaked to him. He informed his masters, and on 11 April, six plotters were put to death and two others imprisoned.

Dominik died on 16 November 1910. That same year, Atangana returned to Jaunde and received an administrative post, perhaps as head of the Ewondo-Bane court, which presided over <a href="civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil disputes</a> and <a href="small%20claims%20court">small claims</a> and was the conduit through which the Germans transmitted communiqués (and gauged the response to them). However, he resigned the post when the head of his sublineage died; Atangana took over as headman of the sublineage and Mvolyé village.

In late 1911, Atangana voyaged to Germany to teach <a href="Ewondo%20language">Ewondo</a> at the Colonial Institute of the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a>. He stayed there for about one year and transcribed Ewondo history and folklore for translation into German. His writings eventually became the "<a href="Jaunde-Texte%20von%20Karl%20Atangana%20und%20Paul%20Messi">Jaunde-Texte</a>", an important source document on Ewondo history and culture. In 1913, he met <a href="William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> in Germany and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20X">Pope Pius X</a> in Rome. He returned to Kamerun the following year.

The Germans had seen some success in uniting disparate groups under single individuals called "<a href="paramount%20chief">paramount chief</a>s" ("Oberhäuptlinge"). Atangana was chosen for this position among the Ewondo and Bane either before his trip to Germany or soon after. This was technically only a temporary appointment; his subjects would have to approve it a year later to make it permanent. They had little alternative; Atangana was already the primary conduit of information to and from the Germans.

Some emulation of European manners and dress was expected of all chiefs, but Atangana seems to have genuinely preferred European styles to African ones. He endeavoured to fit himself into the German mould of an ideal administrator. He wrote, "To dare to approach the Germans it is necessary to abandon the traits which displease them, to become their friend and then be valued by them." Accordingly, Atangana ate German food; formed a European-style, 20-piece orchestra; and ordered a large, Germanic mansion to be built. This latter project requiring construction of a brickyard and sawmill and earned Atangana another epithet, Mindili Ebulu, "the man whose house is so large that it had a roof divided into nine sections instead of the two sections of an ordinary dwelling." The number nine has great significance in Beti folklore.

Atangana was suspicious of anyone who might supplant him as the Germans' favourite. He wrote,

A number of persons who associated themselves with Europeans and proved themselves useful to white people achieved positions in the native society through fraud and extortion. But the Europeans, having noticed it, stopped it. They could discern natives of the noble class by their loyalty and honesty.

Atangana won over other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and intervention on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors from out of town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained a substantial amount of wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.

The paramount chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He persuaded the Germans to carry out infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to <a href="porter%20%28carrier%29">porter</a> duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of <a href="Duala%20people">Duala</a> leader <a href="Rudolf%20Duala%20Manga%20Bell">Rudolf Duala Manga Bell</a> tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.

Atangana's appointment irritated members of the Bulu ethnic group. They feared they might one day lose German favour, or worse yet, fall under the dominion of the Ewondo. This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by <a href="Martin-Paul%20Samba">Martin-Paul Samba</a>, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.

The Allied <a href="West%20Africa%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">West African Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> reached Kamerun in 1914. Douala fell on 17 September, and the Germans regrouped at Jaunde. Beti informants alerted Atangana as to the Allies' progress, and as the loss of Jaunde seemed inevitable, Atangana prepared to escape with his masters. He and the chiefs under him gave their posts to weaker relatives so they could more easily take them back should the Germans return. They held out in Jaunde until 1 January 1916, when troops of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> captured the town, and the German soldiers and missionaries fled into the forest. Atangana and 72 Ewondo and Bane chiefs, along with 14–20,000 villagers (mostly soldiers and their families), led them through. A Beti folk song, "Atangana Ntsama, the War Is Over", tells of the retreat and shows the conflict between those Beti who supported Atangana and those who opposed him:

They reached <a href="Spanish%20Guinea">Spanish Guinea</a> in February and surrendered to the unaligned representatives of <a href="Spain%20under%20the%20Restoration">Spain under the Restoration</a>. The Spanish government of <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Figueroa%20Torres">Álvaro Figueroa Torres</a> gave the Beti land to settle and agreed to transport the Germans to the nearby island of <a href="Bioko">Fernando Po</a>. Atangana and members of his family accompanied them. In 1918, the Germans sent Atangana and six other chiefs to Spain, where they would witness if necessary that the Germans had treated their African subjects humanely. In September 1919, Atangana had an audience with King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII of Spain</a> and urged him to support the Germans in these proceedings. Atangana remained in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> for two years and stayed a month in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to retrieve money he had deposited through the <a href="Basel%20Mission">Basel Mission</a>.

Meanwhile, Ewondo lands came under the administration of the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French Third Republic</a> under a <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>. Atangana, now known by the French version of his name, Charles, wrote the French government to swear his allegiance and demand readmittance to his homeland. He received his wish in June 1920 and arrived in Douala on 28 November 1920.

Atangana's unfailing loyalty and subservience to Germany prevented the French from ever fully trusting him. His first task under the <a href="French%20colonial%20empires">new colonial regime</a> was to supervise gangs of forced road-construction labourers in the town of <a href="Dschang">Dschang</a>. In Atangana's absence, the French had appointed a Beti headman named <a href="Joseph%20Atemengue">Joseph Atemengue</a> as their local representative in Jaunde (now known by the French spelling, Yaoundé). However, Atemengue never enjoyed the popularity Atangana had among the Beti. Atangana tried to secure an alliance with him by sending his 20-year-old, German-educated daughter, Katerina, to marry him, but she eventually fled from the much older Atemengue and back to her father. Atangana's work performance convinced the French to let him return to Yaoundé in late 1921 or early 1922.

Soon thereafter, Atemengue was made chief of the local court, and Atangana was again appointed paramount chief ("chef supérieur"). He received a seat on the <a href="Council%20of%20Notables">Council of Notables</a>, a body the French had introduced to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration. Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.

The French granted the chiefs significantly less power than had their German predecessors. Atangana's major role was simple: to enforce the dictats of French rule. Governor General Van Vollenhoven wrote in 1917 that, "the chiefs have no power of their own of any kind because there are not two authorities in the circle: French authority and indigenous authority; there is only one. Only the commander of the circle commands." As a colonial administrator, Atangana was expected to collect taxes, help the French introduce <a href="Theobroma%20cacao">cocoa</a> and <a href="coffea">coffee</a> <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s, and mobilise chiefs to secure the labour to work these estates. In 1924, the French introduced a requisition system to procure food for the Yaoundé urban community and for rail labourers; Atangana was responsible for rallying the chiefs to gather the necessary provisions from rural farmers; the exact methods used by the chiefs was left to them. Cocoa production in the <a href="South%20Province%20%28Cameroon%29">South</a> and <a href="Centre%20Province">Centre</a> provinces increased even during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, partially as a result of these efforts. He reorganised the chiefs and their duties and tried to Westernise his subjects by encouraging them to wear European-style clothing, use new building methods and house styles, and work to improve roads.

Most of the chiefs respected Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A new system of status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the "fulus" in Ewondo. The entire class recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.

Nevertheless, the Beti at large detested French forced labour practices and taxes. Some people fled to <a href="the%20bush">the bush</a> before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting until the last minute to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.

Nevertheless, his wealth continued to grow. In 1922, his salary was 6,000 francs per year, and in 1938, it had risen to 24,000 francs per year. Atangana also received 2% of all taxes collected by lower chiefs, pay for his legal role, and stipends for organising road construction. Oral informants have reported that as early as 1924, he owned enormous plantations with as much as 1 km of cocoa, 1.1 km of palms, 5 km of food crops, and 500 head of livestock. The amounts may be exaggerated, but Atangana was by all accounts a wealthy man. He owned two lorries and a car by 1926, which he used to haul produce from his plantations. By the 1930s, important chiefs such as Atangana could earn more than 400,000 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> per year on tax collecting alone.

The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control began to oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell especially among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For all the things that we have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing." They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.

In 1925, the French reduced the number of Beti chiefs to 40 and removed the chiefs of Yaoundé from Atangana's direct control. However, in 1928 the Yaoundé chiefs were deemed quarrelsome and incompetent, and Atangana was once again placed over them. In 1929, he wrote a work on traditional Beti society in which he tried to hide his unremarkable childhood by taking the title of "King" and claiming descent from a fictitious line of Ewondo royalty. By the end of the decade, he was the head of perhaps 130,000 people, the chief of Mvolyé village, and the supervisor of eight sectional chiefs and 72 village chiefs. In reality, his position was one of prestige but little actual power.

Collecting taxes and finding labour grew increasingly difficult as the decade progressed, thanks to greater access to paying employment in Yaoundé and on the plantations. Atangana's 1938 proposal for the reorganisation of Yaoundé's administration shows the frustration he experienced at that time:

the local people do not know what endurance means . . . [and] work with ill-will for the administration or for private concerns, where they seek refuge as a safeguard when the administration gives the chiefs an order in the public interest or for their own good.

He further complained, "Notables, with their diminished influence, are almost inert in relation to the growing number of their recalcitrant subjects" and suggested that a chief could hardly control more than 5,000 people. Atangana is not even mentioned in a French report on their African leaders from 1939. However, he retained the right to announce the appointment of new chiefs and to claim that both he and the French had selected them.

Atangana travelled frequently in the French colonial period. He made a point of attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had more opportunities to visit Europe, including the <a href="Paris%20Colonial%20Exposition">Paris Colonial Exposition</a> in 1931 and the <a href="French%20Colonial%20Conference">French Colonial Conference</a> in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana was a handsome man by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: <a href="Marie-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20Assiga%20Ahanda">Marie-Thérèse</a> and René Grégoire. Atangana seems to have adhered to Catholic strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.

Atangana lobbied in his later life for public health causes, such as the eradication of <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a>. He never supported the expansion of <a href="Cameroun">Cameroun</a>'s public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvolyé, Yaoundé.

No one took over as paramount chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 <a href="CFA%20franc">francs CFA</a>.

The colonialism that Atangana had supported was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would aid in the transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.
