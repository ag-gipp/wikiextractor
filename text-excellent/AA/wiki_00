Autism

Autism is a <a href="developmental%20disorder">developmental disorder</a> characterized by difficulties with <a href="social%20interaction">social interaction</a> and <a href="communication">communication</a> and by restricted and repetitive <a href="behavior">behavior</a>. Parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their <a href="developmental%20milestones">developmental milestones</a> at a normal pace before <a href="Regressive%20autism">worsening</a>.
Autism is associated with a combination of <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetic</a> and <a href="environmental%20factors">environmental factors</a>. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain <a href="infection">infection</a>s, such as <a href="rubella">rubella</a>, toxins including <a href="valproic%20acid">valproic acid</a>, <a href="Alcohol%20%28drug%29">alcohol</a>, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="pesticides">pesticides</a> and <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>, <a href="fetal%20growth%20restriction">fetal growth restriction</a>, and <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s. <a href="Controversies%20in%20autism">Controversies</a> surround other proposed environmental <a href="Causes%20of%20autism">causes</a>; for example, the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">vaccine hypothesis</a>, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the <a href="brain">brain</a> by altering connections and organization of <a href="nerve%20cell">nerve cell</a>s and their <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s. How this occurs is not well understood. In the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism and less severe forms of the condition, including <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> and <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder%20not%20otherwise%20specified">pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS), have been combined into the diagnosis of <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a> (ASD).
Early <a href="speech%20therapy">speech therapy</a> or <a href="Applied%20behavior%20analysis">behavioral interventions</a> can help children with autism gain <a href="self-care">self-care</a>, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known <a href="cure">cure</a>, there have been cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some are successful. An <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">autistic culture</a> has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be <a href="Autism%20rights%20movement">accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder</a>.
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide. In the <a href="developed%20countries">developed countries</a>, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , a more than doubling from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It occurs four-to-five times more often in males than females. The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice. The question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.

Autism is a highly variable <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> that first appears during <a href="Infant">infancy</a> or <a href="childhood">childhood</a>, and generally follows a steady course without <a href="Remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.

Social deficits distinguish autism and the related <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a>s (ASD; see <a href="%23Classification">Classification</a>) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="Temple%20Grandin">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the <a href="social%20communication">social communication</a> of <a href="neurotypical">neurotypical</a>s, or people with normal <a href="neural%20development">neural development</a>, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from <a href="social%20norms">social norms</a>; for example, they have less <a href="eye%20contact">eye contact</a> and <a href="turn-taking">turn-taking</a>, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate <a href="nonverbal%20autism">nonverbal</a>ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="Attachment%20%28psychology%29">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less <a href="Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment">attachment security</a> than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD <a href="Face%20perception%23Face%20perception%20in%20individuals%20with%20autism">perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition</a> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.

About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="babbling">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<a href="echolalia">echolalia</a>) or <a href="Pronoun%20reversal">reverse pronouns</a>. <a href="Joint%20attention">Joint attention</a> seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example: they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.


No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.

Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from <a href="splinter%20skill">splinter skill</a>s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="Savant%20syndrome">autistic savants</a>. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. <a href="Sensory%20system">Sensory</a> abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include <a href="Hypotonia">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="Apraxia">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="toe%20walking">toe walking</a>; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur.

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of <a href="stress%20%28psychological%29">stress</a>. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a> in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults. There is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with <a href="gender%20dysphoria">gender dysphoria</a>.

<a href="Gastrointestinal%20diseases">Gastrointestinal problems</a> are one of the most commonly <a href="comorbidity">associated medical disorders</a> in people with autism. These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes.

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetics of autism</a> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <a href="epigenetic">epigenetic</a> factors which do not change <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequencing but are heritable and influence <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. Studies of twins suggest that <a href="heritability">heritability</a> is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <a href="Mendelian">Mendelian</a> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <a href="chromosome%20abnormality">chromosome abnormality</a>, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous <a href="structural%20variation">structural variation</a> — such as <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a>, <a href="Gene%20duplication">duplications</a> or <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversions</a> in genetic material during <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition.

Maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. <a href="Intrauterine%20growth%20restriction">Intrauterine growth restriction</a> is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.

Exposure to <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> during pregnancy, especially <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. <a href="Environmental%20factor">Environmental factor</a>s that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s, <a href="PCBs">PCBs</a>, <a href="phthalates">phthalates</a> and <a href="phenols">phenols</a> used in plastic products, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="brominated%20flame%20retardant">brominated flame retardant</a>s, <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a>, smoking, <a href="illicit%20drug">illicit drug</a>s, <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s, and <a href="prenatal%20stress">prenatal stress</a>. Some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.

Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming <a href="Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload">vaccine "overload"</a>, a <a href="Thiomersal%20controversy">vaccine preservative</a>, or the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">MMR vaccine</a> for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of <a href="childhood%20immunizations">childhood immunizations</a>, <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy%23Disease%20outbreaks">outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases</a> in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <a href="neuropsychological">neuropsychological</a> linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.

There is evidence that <a href="gut%E2%80%93brain%20axis">gut–brain axis</a> abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, <a href="gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal</a> inflammation, malfunction of the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a>, <a href="gut%20flora">gut flora</a> alterations, and food <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that <a href="enteric%20nervous%20system">enteric nervous system</a> abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain.

Several lines of evidence point to <a href="Synapse">synaptic</a> dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with <a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known <a href="teratogen">teratogen</a>s (agents that cause <a href="birth%20defect">birth defect</a>s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from <a href="Human%20fertilization">conception</a>, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.

<a href="Medical%20diagnosis">Diagnosis</a> is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or <a href="Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology">idiosyncratic language</a>, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or global developmental delay. <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <a href="Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale">Childhood Autism Rating Scale</a> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.

A <a href="pediatrician">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated <a href="medical%20conditions">medical conditions</a>. A pediatric <a href="neuropsychologist">neuropsychologist</a> is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>, <a href="hearing%20impairment">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="specific%20language%20impairment">specific language impairment</a> such as <a href="Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome">Landau–Kleffner syndrome</a>. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>.

<a href="Clinical%20genetics">Clinical genetics</a> evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and <a href="fragile%20X">fragile X</a> testing. A <a href="Genotype-first%20approach">genotype-first</a> model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. <a href="Metabolic">Metabolic</a> and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <a href="blindism">blindism</a>s.

Autism is one of the five <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a>s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.

Of the five PDD forms, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <a href="PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified">PDD not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in <a href="language%20development">language development</a>. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <a href="Trait%20%28biology%29">traits</a>, such as avoiding eye contact.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide <a href="Spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a>, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <a href="developmentally%20disabled">developmentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, <a href="pedantic">pedantic</a> communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or <a href="high-functioning%20autism">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="IQ">IQ</a> thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into <a href="Syndrome">syndromal</a> and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the <a href="Diagnosis%20of%20Asperger%20syndrome%23Differences%20from%20high-functioning%20autism">overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism</a> is unclear.

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that <a href="regressive%20autism">regressive autism</a> is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.

Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="neurology">neurology</a> and <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a>. Newer technologies such as <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a> and <a href="diffusion%20tensor%20imaging">diffusion tensor imaging</a> can help identify biologically relevant <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s (observable traits) that can be viewed on <a href="brain%20scan">brain scan</a>s, to help further <a href="neurogenetic">neurogenetic</a> studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the <a href="fusiform%20face%20area">fusiform face area</a> of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.

About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".

The <a href="United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">screen</a> all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">M-CHAT</a> and its predecessor, the <a href="Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low <a href="Sensitivity%20%28tests%29">sensitivity</a> (many false-negatives) but good <a href="Specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a> (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although <a href="genetic%20screening">genetic screening</a> for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and <a href="dysmorphic%20feature">dysmorphic feature</a>s.

While infection with <a href="rubella">rubella</a> during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, <a href="rubella%20vaccine">vaccination against rubella</a> can prevent many of those cases.

The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by <a href="Professional%20practice%20of%20behavior%20analysis">behavior analysts</a>, <a href="special%20education">special education</a> <a href="teachers">teachers</a>, <a href="speech-language%20pathology">speech pathologists</a>, and licensed <a href="psychologists">psychologists</a>. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a>. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained <a href="special%20education">special education</a> programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.

Educational interventions often used include <a href="applied%20behavior%20analysis">applied behavior analysis</a> (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, <a href="speech%20and%20language%20therapy">speech and language therapy</a>, <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> therapy, and <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a treatment procedure encompassing over thirty hours per week of the <a href="Discrete%20trial%20training">structured type of ABA</a> that is carried out with very young children—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include <a href="Discrete%20trial%20training">structured</a> and <a href="Pivotal%20response%20treatment">naturalistic</a> ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.

<a href="Discrete%20trial%20training">Early, intensive ABA therapy</a> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more <a href="Pivotal%20response%20treatment">naturalistic form of ABA</a> combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as <a href="ADHD">ADHD</a> or <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety</a>. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive drug</a>s or <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s, with the most common drug classes being <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s, and <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s. The <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotic</a> drugs <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> and <a href="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</a> are <a href="Food%20and%20drug%20administration">FDA</a>-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. <a href="SSRI%20antidepressants">SSRI antidepressants</a>, such as <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a> and <a href="fluvoxamine">fluvoxamine</a>, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication <a href="methylphenidate">methylphenidate</a> is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

Although many <a href="Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities">alternative therapies and interventions</a> are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in <a href="Quality%20of%20life">quality-of-life</a> contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. The preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on <a href="casein-free%20diet">casein-free diet</a>s, as a consequence of the low intake of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a>; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and <a href="gastrointestinal%20disease">gastrointestinal disorders</a>. In 2005, botched <a href="chelation%20therapy">chelation therapy</a> killed a five-year-old child with autism. Chelation is not recommended for people with ASD since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is <a href="CEASE%20therapy">CEASE therapy</a>, a mixture of <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, supplements, and 'vaccine detoxing'.

Although popularly used as an <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">alternative treatment</a> for people with autism, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a <a href="gluten-free%2C%20casein-free%20diet">gluten- and casein-free diet</a> as a standard treatment. A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known <a href="food%20intolerance">food intolerance</a>s or <a href="food%20allergy">allergies</a>, or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double blind crossover trial, 1 single blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect.

In the subset of people who have <a href="non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity">gluten sensitivity</a> there is limited evidence that suggests that a <a href="gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free diet</a> may improve some autistic behaviors.

There is tentative evidence that <a href="music%20therapy">music therapy</a> may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">hyperbaric treatment</a>s in children with autism.

The emergence of the <a href="autism%20rights%20movement">autism rights movement</a> has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism. Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease. Proponents of this movement wish to seek "acceptance, not cures." There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as <a href="World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day">World Autism Awareness Day</a>, <a href="Light%20It%20Up%20Blue">Light It Up Blue</a>, <a href="Autism%20Sunday">Autism Sunday</a>, <a href="Autistic%20Pride%20Day">Autistic Pride Day</a>, <a href="Autreat">Autreat</a>, and others. There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life. These organizations include <a href="Autism%20Speaks">Autism Speaks</a>, <a href="Autism%20National%20Committee">Autism National Committee</a>, <a href="Autism%20Society%20of%20America">Autism Society of America</a>, and many others. Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about "autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements." Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism. "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>", a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistic individuals do not have these special abilities, some have been successful in their fields.

Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (<a href="net%20present%20value">net present value</a> in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% <a href="medical%20care">medical care</a>, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that <a href="child%20care">child care</a> problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and <a href="estate%20planning">estate planning</a>.

There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack <a href="social%20support">social support</a>, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or <a href="Self-determination%20theory">self-determination</a>. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.

Few high-quality studies address long-term <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an <a href="IQ">IQ</a> above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; <a href="independent%20living">independent living</a> is unlikely with severe autism. 

Many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. Compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. People in there 20s with autism have an employment rate of 58%.

Most recent <a href="review">review</a>s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true rate. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">NHS</a> estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "<a href="Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29">Table Talk</a>" of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The <a href="Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron">Wild Boy of Aveyron</a>, a <a href="feral%20child">feral child</a> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <a href="Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard">Jean Itard</a> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.

The <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the <a href="Swiss%20people">Swiss</a> psychiatrist <a href="Eugen%20Bleuler">Eugen Bleuler</a> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance". A Soviet child psychiatrist, <a href="Grunya%20Sukhareva">Grunya Sukhareva</a>, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.

The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when <a href="Hans%20Asperger">Hans Asperger</a> of the <a href="Vienna%20General%20Hospital">Vienna University Hospital</a> adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about <a href="child%20psychology">child psychology</a>. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. <a href="Leo%20Kanner">Leo Kanner</a> of the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.

<a href="Donald%20Triplett">Donald Triplett</a> was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.

Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "<a href="refrigerator%20mother">refrigerator mother</a>s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.

As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel <a href="social%20stigma">social stigma</a> in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many <a href="primary%20care%20physician">primary care physician</a>s and <a href="medical%20specialist">medical specialist</a>s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.

It took until 1980 for the <a href="DSM-III">DSM-III</a> to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the <a href="DSM-III-R">DSM-III-R</a> provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a> was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>, autism, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, and <a href="Childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">CDD</a>, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">Societal and cultural aspects of autism</a> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <a href="Neurodiversity">autism is simply another way of being</a>.

Apollo 11

Apollo 11 was the <a href="human%20spaceflight">spaceflight</a> that <a href="Moon%20landing">landed</a> the first two people on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Commander <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and lunar module pilot <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a>, both American, landed the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a> "Eagle" on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> flew the <a href="Apollo%20command%20and%20service%20module">command module</a> "Columbia" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21.5 hours on the lunar surface before rejoining "Columbia" in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket from <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on <a href="Merritt%20Island%2C%20Florida">Merritt Island, Florida</a>, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and was the fifth crewed mission of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>. The Apollo <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29">spacecraft</a> had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After being <a href="Trans-lunar%20injection">sent to the Moon</a> by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into "Eagle" and landed in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Tranquillity">Sea of Tranquillity</a>. The astronauts used "Eagle"s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned "Eagle" before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and <a href="splashdown">splashed down</a> in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively ended the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>: "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, a geopolitical rivalry with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik 1</a>, the first <a href="Satellite">artificial satellite</a>. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic and technological superiority. This precipitated the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, and triggered the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>. <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), and initiating <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>, which aimed to launch a man into <a href="Earth%20orbit">Earth orbit</a>. But on April 12, 1961, Soviet <a href="cosmonaut">cosmonaut</a> <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a> became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower's successor, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>.

Kennedy believed that it was in the national interest of the United States to be superior to other nations, and that the perception of American power was at least as important as the actuality. It was therefore intolerable that the Soviet Union was more advanced in the field of space exploration. He was determined that the United States should compete, and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning. Since the Soviet Union had better <a href="Booster%20%28rocketry%29">booster rocket</a>s, he required a challenge that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, one where the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. Something spectacular, even if it could not be justified on military, economic or scientific grounds. After consulting with his experts and advisors, he chose such a project. On May 25, 1961, he addressed the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> on "Urgent National Needs" and declared:

The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: <a href="Project%20Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. An early and crucial decision was choosing <a href="lunar%20orbit%20rendezvous">lunar orbit rendezvous</a> over both <a href="direct%20ascent">direct ascent</a> and <a href="Earth%20orbit%20rendezvous">Earth orbit rendezvous</a>. A <a href="space%20rendezvous">space rendezvous</a> is an <a href="orbital%20maneuver">orbital maneuver</a> in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. On July 11, 1962, James Webb announced the decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous. This resulted in a much smaller launch vehicle, and in the <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29">Apollo spacecraft</a> being composed of three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. This choice of mode meant that the spacecraft could be launched by a single <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket that was then under development.

Technologies and technics required for Apollo were developed by <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a>. Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> fire on January 27, 1967, in which three astronauts died, and the subsequent investigation. In October 1968, <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> evaluated the command module in Earth orbit, and in December <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> tested it in lunar orbit. In March 1969, <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a> put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit, and in May <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a> conducted a "dress rehearsal" in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.

The Soviet Union competed with the US in the Space Race, but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the <a href="N1%20%28rocket%29">N1 launcher</a>, which was comparable to the Saturn V. The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of <a href="Unmanned%20spacecraft">unmanned probes</a>. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched <a href="Luna%2015">Luna 15</a>, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in <a href="Mare%20Crisium">Mare Crisium</a> about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The <a href="Nuffield%20Radio%20Astronomy%20Laboratories">Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories</a> radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.

The initial crew assignment of Commander <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>, Command Module Pilot (CMP) <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> on the backup crew for Apollo 9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967. Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini 12</a>. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.

There would be one change. <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a>, the CMP on the Apollo 8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crewmembers had prior spaceflight experience, the first being Apollo 10. The next was <a href="STS-26">STS-26</a> in 1988.

Slayton gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin, but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a>).

The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie that characterized that of <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>. Instead they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship. Aldrin and Collins described the crew as "amiable strangers". Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said "...all the crews I was on worked very well together."

The backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a> as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8. In early 1969, he accepted a job with the <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Council">National Aeronautics and Space Council</a> effective August 1969, and announced that he would retire as an astronaut at that time. <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a> was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a>.

During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them. For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, <a href="Ronald%20Evans%20%28astronaut%29">Ronald Evans</a> and <a href="William%20R.%20Pogue">Bill Pogue</a>.

The <a href="capsule%20communicator">capsule communicator</a> (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control Center</a> in <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston, Texas</a>, who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were: <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a>, Ronald Evans, <a href="Bruce%20McCandless%20II">Bruce McCandless II</a>, James Lovell, William Anders, Ken Mattingly, Fred Haise, <a href="Don%20L.%20Lind">Don L. Lind</a>, <a href="Owen%20K.%20Garriott">Owen K. Garriott</a> and <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a>.

The four shift <a href="Flight%20controller%23FLIGHT">flight directors</a> for this mission were:

The Apollo 11 <a href="Mission%20patch">mission emblem</a> was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>, the <a href="national%20bird">national bird</a> of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested that they put an <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a> in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided that the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colours, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that "eleven" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with "Apollo 11", and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would "be representative of "everyone" who had worked toward a lunar landing".

An illustrator at the MSC did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval. The design was rejected. <a href="Bob%20Gilruth">Bob Gilruth</a>, the director of the MSC felt that the talons of the eagle looked "too warlike". After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons. When the <a href="Eisenhower%20dollar">Eisenhower dollar coin</a> was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20dollar">Susan B. Anthony dollar</a> unveiled in 1979.

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft "Charlie Brown" and "Snoopy", assistant manager for public affairs <a href="Julian%20Scheer">Julian Scheer</a> wrote to <a href="George%20M.%20Low">George M. Low</a>, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the <a href="Manned%20Spacecraft%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> (MSC), to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name "Snowcone" was used for the CM and "Haystack" was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.

The LM was named "Eagle" after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer's suggestion, the CM was named "Columbia" after "<a href="Columbiad%23In%20fiction">Columbiad</a>", the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s 1865 novel "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon">From the Earth to the Moon</a>". It also referenced <a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>, a historical name of the United States. In Collins' 1976 book, he said "Columbia" was in reference to <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>.

The astronaut had personal preference kits (PPKs), small bags containing personal items of significance that they wanted to take with them on the mission. Five PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: three (one for each astronaut) were stowed on "Columbia" before launch, and two on "Eagle".

Neil Armstrong's LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a>' 1903 "<a href="Wright%20Flyer">Wright Flyer</a>"s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded <a href="astronaut%20pin">astronaut pin</a> originally given to <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards; but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.

NASA's Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five unmanned probes of the <a href="Lunar%20Orbiter%20program">Lunar Orbiter program</a> and information about surface conditions provided by the <a href="Surveyor%20program">Surveyor program</a>. The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required. The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required; clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.

Areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found. Five sites were considered: Sites 1 and 2 were in the Sea of Tranquility ("<a href="Mare%20Tranquilitatis">Mare Tranquilitatis</a>"); Site 3 was in the Central Bay ("<a href="Sinus%20Medii">Sinus Medii</a>"); and Sites 4 and 5 were in the Ocean of Storms ("<a href="Oceanus%20Procellarum">Oceanus Procellarum</a>").
The final site selection was based on seven criteria:

The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month. A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience. The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site 2, with Sites 3 and 5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10's lunar module flew to within of Site 2, and reported that it was acceptable.

During the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question a reporter asked was, "Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?" Slayton told the reporter that it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was "not based on individual desire".

One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the command module pilot, which matched what had been done in previous missions. The commander had never performed the spacewalk. Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator <a href="George%20Mueller%20%28NASA%29">George Mueller</a> told reporters he would be the first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first to step on the Moon because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.

For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring. Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, "Yes, that’s the way to do it."

The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first. <a href="Chris%20Kraft">Chris Kraft</a> revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.

The ascent stage of lunar module LM-5 arrived at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and Command and Service Module CM-107 on January 23. There were several differences between LM-5 and Apollo 10's LM-4; LM-5 had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the <a href="Early%20Apollo%20Scientific%20Experiments%20Package">Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package</a> (EASEP). The only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch. The command and service modules were mated on January 29, and moved from the <a href="Operations%20and%20Checkout%20Building">Operations and Checkout Building</a> to the <a href="Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building">Vehicle Assembly Building</a> on April 14.

The <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by the <a href="S-II">S-II</a> second stage on February 6, <a href="S-IC">S-IC</a> first stage on February 20, and the <a href="Saturn%20V%20Instrument%20Unit">Saturn V Instrument Unit</a> on February 27. At 1230 on May 20, the assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the <a href="crawler-transporter">crawler-transporter</a>, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of <a href="Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a>, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the <a href="service%20structure">mobile service structure</a> back to its parking area. In the early hours of the morning, the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a>. Fueling was completed by three hours before launch. Launch operations were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the <a href="ATOLL%20%28programming%20language%29">ATOLL programming language</a>.

Slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 0630, they headed out to Launch Complex 39. Haise entered "Columbia" about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch. Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch. The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time. Over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the <a href="firing%20room">firing room</a>.

An estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="William%20Westmoreland">William Westmoreland</a>, four <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20States">cabinet members</a>, 19 <a href="Governor%20%28United%20States%29">state governors</a>, 40 <a href="Mayoralty%20in%20the%20United%20States">mayors</a>, 60 <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a>s and 200 <a href="congressmen">congressmen</a>. <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> viewed the launch with the former president, <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> and his wife <a href="Lady%20Bird%20Johnson">Lady Bird Johnson</a>. Around 3,500 media representatives were present. About two-thirds were from the United States; the rest came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> viewed the launch from his office in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> with his NASA liaison officer, Apollo astronaut <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>.

Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> (9:32:00 <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a>). It entered Earth orbit at an altitude of by , twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a> (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the <a href="transposition%2C%20docking%2C%20and%20extraction">transposition, docking, and extraction</a> maneuver was performed. This involved separating "Columbia" from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with "Eagle" still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon. This was done to avoid colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon. A <a href="Gravity%20assist">slingshot effect</a> from passing around the Moon threw it into an <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">orbit around the Sun</a>.

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a>. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about southwest of the crater <a href="Collins%20%28crater%29">Sabine D</a>. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated <a href="Ranger%208">Ranger 8</a> and <a href="Surveyor%205">Surveyor 5</a> landers and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or EVA challenges. It lay about southeast of the Surveyor 5 landing site, and southwest of Ranger 8's crash site.

At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered "Eagle", and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 "Eagle" separated from "Columbia". Collins, alone aboard "Columbia", inspected "Eagle" as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed. Armstrong exclaimed: "The "Eagle" has wings!"

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were "long"; they would land miles west of their target point. "Eagle" was traveling too fast. The problem could have been <a href="mass%20concentration%20%28astronomy%29">mascons</a>—concentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel. Or it could have been the result of "Eagle"s pirouette maneuver.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and above the surface of the Moon, the <a href="Apollo%20Guidance%20Computer">LM guidance computer</a> (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer <a href="Jack%20Garman">Jack Garman</a> told <a href="Flight%20controller%23GUIDO">Guidance Officer</a> <a href="Steve%20Bales">Steve Bales</a> it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. <a href="Margaret%20Hamilton%20%28scientist%29">Margaret Hamilton</a>, the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the <a href="MIT">MIT</a> <a href="Charles%20Stark%20Draper%20Laboratory">Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> later recalled:

During the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time. Software engineer Don Eyles concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first unmanned LM in <a href="Apollo%205">Apollo 5</a>. Having the rendezvous radar on (so that it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious <a href="cycle%20stealing">cycle stealing</a>, as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a diameter crater (later determined to be <a href="West%20%28lunar%20crater%29">West crater</a>), so he took semi-automatic control. Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too fast. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting "Eagle". Now above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.

Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM's engines began to obfuscate his ability to determine the spacecraft's motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft's speed.

A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from "Eagle" footpads had touched the surface, and he said: "Contact light!" Armstrong was supposed to immediately shutdown the engines, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make them explode, but forgot. Three seconds later, "Eagle" landed and Armstrong shutdown the engines. Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of <a href="detent">detent</a>." Armstrong acknowledged: "Out of detent. Auto." Aldrin continued: "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in."

ACA was the attitude control assembly, the LM's control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the <a href="reaction%20control%20system">reaction control system</a> (RCS) jets to fire. "Out of Detent" meant that the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. LGC address 413 contained the variable that indicated that the LM had landed.

"Eagle" landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left. Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off", before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, "Houston, <a href="Tranquility%20Base">Tranquility Base</a> here. The "Eagle" has landed." Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: "Roger, Twan— Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot."
Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:

He then took <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist <a href="Madalyn%20Murray%20O%27Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a> (who had objected to the <a href="Apollo%208%20Genesis%20reading">Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis</a>) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the <a href="Webster%2C%20Texas">Webster</a> <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian Church</a>, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20. The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

Preparations for the EVA began at 23:43. These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two. During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets and tools. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, "Eagle" was depressurized. The hatch was opened at 02:39:33. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his <a href="primary%20life%20support%20system">portable life support system</a> (PLSS). Some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress. At 02:51 Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface. The remote control unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly (MESA) folded against "Eagle" side and activate the TV camera.

Apollo 11 used <a href="slow-scan%20television">slow-scan television</a> (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture. The signal was received at <a href="Goldstone%20Deep%20Space%20Communications%20Complex">Goldstone</a> in the United States, but with better fidelity by <a href="Honeysuckle%20Creek%20Tracking%20Station">Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station</a> near <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive <a href="Parkes%20Observatory">Parkes radio telescope</a> in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, but <a href="Apollo%2011%20missing%20tapes">recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface</a> were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.

While still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a <a href="lunar%20plaque">plaque</a> mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:
After describing the surface dust as "very fine-grained" and "almost like a powder", at 02:56:15, six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off "Eagle" footpad and declared: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."

Armstrong intended to say "That's one small step for a man", but the word "a" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said "for a man", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the "a" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words "for a" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the "a" may have been spoken but obscured by static.

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM. Twelve minutes after the sample was collected, he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a <a href="Hasselblad">Hasselblad</a> camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong's <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">Apollo/Skylab A7L</a> space suit. Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: "Magnificent desolation."

Armstrong said that moving in the <a href="Gravitation%20of%20the%20Moon">lunar gravity</a>, one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around." Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into "Eagle" shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits.
The astronauts planted the <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">Lunar Flag Assembly</a> containing a <a href="flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">flag of the United States</a> on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, "Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising." But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches (5 cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers. But he gave "a crisp West Point salute". Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House." Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.

They deployed the <a href="Early%20Apollo%20Scientific%20Experiments%20Package">EASEP</a>, which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure <a href="moonquake">moonquake</a>s and a <a href="Retroreflector%23Retroreflectors%20on%20the%20Moon">retroreflector</a> array used for the <a href="lunar%20laser%20ranging%20experiment">lunar laser ranging experiment</a>. Then Armstrong walked from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two <a href="core%20sample">core sample</a>s. He used the <a href="geologist%27s%20hammer">geologist's hammer</a> to pound in the tubes – the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11, but was unable to penetrate more than deep. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly. Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and <a href="breccia">breccia</a>. Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: <a href="armalcolite">armalcolite</a>, <a href="tranquillityite">tranquillityite</a>, and <a href="pyroxferroite">pyroxferroite</a>. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.

Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.

Aldrin entered "Eagle" first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM <a href="life%20support">life support</a>, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.
Nixon's speech writer <a href="William%20Safire">William Safire</a> had prepared "In Event of Moon Disaster" for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="H.%20R.%20Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a>, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. According to the plan, Mission Control would "close down communications" with the LM, and a clergyman would "commend their souls to the deepest of the deep" in a public ritual likened to <a href="burial%20at%20sea">burial at sea</a>. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>'s First World War poem, "<a href="The%20Soldier%20%28poem%29">The Soldier</a>".

While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the <a href="circuit%20breaker">circuit breaker</a> that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. A felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch; had this not worked, the LM circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.

After more than hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> mission patch in memory of astronauts <a href="Roger%20B.%20Chaffee">Roger Chaffee</a>, <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, and <a href="Ed%20White%20%28astronaut%29">Edward White</a>, who died when their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk carrying the <a href="Apollo%2011%20goodwill%20messages">goodwill statements</a> by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.
After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in "Eagle" ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard "Columbia" in lunar orbit. Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: "The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the <a href="attitude%20indicator">attitude indicator</a>, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over." Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags further from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

During his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said "not since <a href="Adam">Adam</a> has any human known such solitude", Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: "this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two". In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while "Columbia" passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather "awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation".

One of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a>s and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.

Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins that there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of "Columbia" might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the offending system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When "Columbia" came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as "relaxing". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for "Eagle" to meet up with "Columbia", Collins was prepared for certain contingencies in which he would fly "Columbia" down to meet "Eagle".

"Eagle" rendezvoused with "Columbia" at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. "Eagle"s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41. Just before the <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> flight, it was noted that "Eagle" was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that "Eagle" orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an "uncertain location" on the lunar surface.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: 
Aldrin added: 

Armstrong concluded: 

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.

The <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> , under the command of <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Carl%20J.%20Seiberlich">Carl J. Seiberlich</a>, was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing its sister ship, the <a href="Landing%20Platform%20Helicopter">LPH</a> , which had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. "Hornet" was then at her home port of <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>. On reaching <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on July 5, "Hornet" embarked the <a href="Sikorsky%20SH-3%20Sea%20King">Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King</a> helicopters of <a href="HS-4">HS-4</a>, a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of <a href="Underwater%20Demolition%20Team">UDT</a> Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make room, most of "Hornet"s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a <a href="Boilerplate%20%28spaceflight%29">boilerplate</a> command module used for training.

On July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, "Hornet" departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific, in the vicinity of . A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20P.%20Rogers">William P. Rogers</a> and <a href="National%20Security%20Advisor%20%28United%20States%29">National Security Advisor</a> <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> flew to <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a> on <a href="Air%20Force%20One">Air Force One</a>, then to the <a href="command%20ship">command ship</a> in <a href="Marine%20One">Marine One</a>. After a night on board, they would fly to "Hornet" in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard "Hornet", the party was greeted by the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Command">Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC)</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Jr.">John S. McCain Jr.</a>, and <a href="NASA%20Administrator">NASA Administrator</a> <a href="Thomas%20O.%20Paine">Thomas O. Paine</a>, who flew to "Hornet" from <a href="Pago%20Pago">Pago Pago</a> in one of "Hornet"s <a href="carrier%20onboard%20delivery">carrier onboard delivery</a> aircraft.

Weather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force <a href="captain%20%28O-3%29">Captain</a> Hank Brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility was a serious threat to the mission; if the helicopters could not locate "Columbia", the spacecraft, its crew, and its priceless cargo of Moon rocks might be lost. Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Fleet Weather Center</a> at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Donald%20C.%20Davis">Donald C. Davis</a>, the commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific, advised NASA to change the recovery area. This was done; a new one was designated, northeast of the original.

This altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned that they would not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67. The first program's acceleration subjected the astronauts to ; the second, to .

Before dawn on July 24, "Hornet" launched four Sea King helicopters and three <a href="Grumman%20E-1%20Tracer">Grumman E-1 Tracer</a>s. Two of the E-1s were designated as "air boss" while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon. At 16:44 UTC (05:44 local time) "Columbia"s <a href="drogue%20parachute">drogue parachute</a>s were deployed. This was observed by the helicopters. Seven minutes later "Columbia" struck the water forcefully east of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, south of Johnston Atoll, and from "Hornet", at . During <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a>, "Columbia" landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a> to prevent it from drifting. More divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction.
The divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a <a href="sodium%20hypochlorite">sodium hypochlorite</a> solution and "Columbia" wiped with <a href="Betadine">Betadine</a> to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board "Hornet". The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.

After touchdown on "Hornet" at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the to the <a href="Mobile%20Quarantine%20Facility">Mobile Quarantine Facility</a> (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped. Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: "As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before."

After Nixon departed, "Hornet" was brought alongside the "Columbia", which was lifted aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a <a href="Dolly%20%28trailer%29">dolly</a> and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. "Hornet" returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a <a href="Lockheed%20C-141%20Starlifter">Lockheed C-141 Starlifter</a> and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the <a href="Lunar%20Receiving%20Laboratory">Lunar Receiving Laboratory</a> at 10:00 UTC on July 28. "Columbia" was taken to <a href="Ford%20Island">Ford Island</a> for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to <a href="Hickham%20Air%20Force%20Base">Hickham Air Force Base</a>, from whence it was flown to Houston in a <a href="Douglas%20C-133%20Cargomaster">Douglas C-133 Cargomaster</a>, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.

In accordance with the <a href="Extra-Terrestrial%20Exposure%20Law">Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law</a>, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on "Hornet", and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician <a href="William%20Carpentier">William Carpentier</a> and MQF project engineer <a href="John%20Hirasaki">John Hirasaki</a>), and on "Columbia" itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.

On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official <a href="state%20dinner">state dinner</a> to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a>, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the <a href="Century%20Plaza%20Hotel">Century Plaza Hotel</a>. Nixon and Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.

The three astronauts spoke before a <a href="joint%20session%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">joint session of Congress</a> on September 16, 1969. They presented two US flags, one to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and the other to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them. The <a href="flag%20of%20American%20Samoa">flag of American Samoa</a> on Apollo 11 is on display at the <a href="Jean%20P.%20Haydon%20Museum">Jean P. Haydon Museum</a> in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.

This celebration was the beginning of a 38-day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries. The crew toured from September 29 to November 5. Many nations honored the first human <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a> with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.

Humans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy's goal set eight years earlier. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy's speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words "TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969". The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States' technological superiority over other nations. With the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.

New phrases permeated into the English language. "If they can send a man to the Moon, why can't they..." became a common saying following Apollo 11. Armstrong's famous words on the lunar surface also spun off countless parodies.

While most celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched. This is not to say that they were not awed by it. <a href="Ralph%20Abernathy">Ralph Abernathy</a>, leading a protest march, was so captivated by the spectacle of the Apollo 11 launch that he forgot what he was going to say. Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on Earth. A poem by <a href="Gil%20Scott-Heron">Gil Scott-Heron</a> called "Whitey on the Moon" illustrated the <a href="racial%20inequality%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial inequality in the United States</a> that was highlighted by the Space Race. The poem starts with:

Twenty percent of the world's population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation. One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy's goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished. A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.

While most Americans were proud of their nation's achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the <a href="Gallup%20Poll">Gallup Poll</a> indicate that a majority of Americans favored "doing more" in space as opposed to "doing less". By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had ended, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of <a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a>. This was also a time when <a href="inflation">inflation</a> was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned <a href="Caspar%20Weinberger">Caspar Weinberger</a>, the deputy director of the <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a>, might send a signal that "our best years are behind us".

After the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said that landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated that they were not making an attempt. <a href="Mstislav%20Keldysh">Mstislav Keldysh</a> said in July 1969 that, "We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems". It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable to due to technological difficulties. The public's reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.

The Command Module "Columbia" went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals, the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">District of Columbia</a>, and <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska</a>. In 1971, it was transferred to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, and was displayed at the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> (NASM) in Washington, DC. It was in the central "Milestones of Flight" exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the "<a href="Wright%20Flyer">Wright Flyer</a>", "<a href="Spirit%20of%20St.%20Louis">Spirit of St. Louis</a>", <a href="Bell%20X-1">Bell X-1</a>, <a href="North%20American%20X-15">North American X-15</a> and "<a href="Friendship%207">Friendship 7</a>".

"Columbia" was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a> in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city tour titled "Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission". This included <a href="Space%20Center%20Houston">Space Center Houston</a> from October 14, 2017 to March 18, 2018, the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Science%20Center">Saint Louis Science Center</a> from April 14 to September 3, 2018, the Senator John <a href="Heinz%20History%20Center">Heinz History Center</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> from September 29, 2018 to February 18, 2019, and the <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> <a href="Museum%20of%20Flight">Museum of Flight</a> from March 16 to September 2, 2019.

For 40 years Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits were displayed in the museum's "Apollo to the Moon" exhibit, until it closed for good on December 3, 2018, to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022. A special display of Armstrong's suit is planned for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in July 2019. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the Smithsonian's <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a> annex near <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Washington Dulles International Airport</a> in Chantilly, Virginia, where they are on display along with a test lunar module.
The descent stage of the LM "Eagle" remains on the Moon. In 2009, the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts. The remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface, after being abandoned and impacting the Moon. The location is uncertain because "Eagle" ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.

In March 2012 a team of specialists financed by <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> founder <a href="Jeff%20Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> located the <a href="Rocketdyne%20F-1">F-1 engines</a> from the S-IC stage that launched Apollo 11 into space. They were found on the Atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from Apollo 11.
The S-IVB third stage which performed Apollo 11's trans-lunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of Earth.

The main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the <a href="Lunar%20Sample%20Laboratory%20Facility">Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility</a> at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston, Texas</a>. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at <a href="White%20Sands%20Test%20Facility">White Sands Test Facility</a> near <a href="Las%20Cruces%2C%20New%20Mexico">Las Cruces, New Mexico</a>. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples, and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.

In November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation <a href="Apollo%2011%20lunar%20sample%20display">Apollo 11 lunar sample display</a>s for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50 mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">United States half dollar coin</a>. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. The Apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by Nixon in 1970.

The Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969. , the <a href="Lunar%20Laser%20Ranging%20experiment">Lunar Laser Ranging experiment</a> remains operational.

On July 15, 2009, <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life.com</a> released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by "Life" photographer <a href="Ralph%20Morse">Ralph Morse</a> prior to the Apollo 11 launch. From July 16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred. It is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments. In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time. The <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</a> set up an <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash</a> website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.

On July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> at the White House. "We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin", Obama said. "We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey." On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator <a href="Bill%20Nelson%20%28politician%29">Bill Nelson</a> and Florida Representative <a href="Alan%20Grayson">Alan Grayson</a>.

A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:

On June 10, 2015, United States Congressman <a href="Bill%20Posey">Bill Posey</a> introduced resolution H.R. 2726 to the 114th session of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> directing the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> to design and sell commemorative coins in Gold, Silver and Clad for the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On January 24, 2019, the United States Mint released the coins to the public on their website. A documentary film, "<a href="Apollo%2011%20%282019%20film%29">Apollo 11</a>", with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in IMAX on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8.

Aikido

Aikido's techniques include: <a href="irimi">irimi</a> (entering), and <a href="tenkan">tenkan</a> (turning) movements (that redirect the opponent's attack <a href="momentum">momentum</a>), various types of <a href="Throw%20%28grappling%29">throw</a>s and <a href="joint%20lock">joint lock</a>s.

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of <a href="Dait%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB%20Aiki-j%C5%ABjutsu">Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu</a>, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the <a href="Oomoto">Ōmoto-kyō</a> religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term "aiki-jūjutsu".

Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.

The word "aikido" is formed of three <a href="kanji">kanji</a>:

The term "<a href="Aiki%20%28martial%20arts%20principle%29">aiki</a>" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of <a href="bud%C5%8D">budō</a>. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.

The term is also found in martial arts such as <a href="judo">judo</a> and <a href="kendo">kendo</a>, and in various non-martial arts, such as <a href="Japanese%20calligraphy">Japanese calligraphy</a> (), <a href="ikebana">flower arranging</a> () and <a href="Japanese%20tea%20ceremony">tea ceremony</a> ().

Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces" or "Way of unifying energy", in which the term "aiki" refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort. One applies by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.

Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ( , 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as ("Great Teacher"). The term "aikido" was coined in the twentieth century. Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the "aiki" that Ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.

Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied. The core martial art from which aikido derives is <a href="Daito-ryu%20aiki-jujutsu">Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu</a>, which Ueshiba studied directly with <a href="Takeda%20S%C5%8Dkaku">Takeda Sōkaku</a>, the reviver of that art. Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied <a href="Tenjin%20Shinyo%20Ryu">Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū</a> with Tozawa Tokusaburō in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in 1901, <a href="Yagy%C5%AB%20Shingan-ry%C5%AB">Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū</a> under Nakai Masakatsu in <a href="Sakai%2C%20Osaka">Sakai</a> from 1903 to 1908, and <a href="judo">judo</a> with Kiyoichi Takagi ( , 1894–1972) in <a href="Tanabe">Tanabe</a> in 1911.

The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the <a href="spear">spear</a> (), short <a href="Stick%20fighting">staff</a> (), and perhaps the . However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ().

Ueshiba moved to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915. His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937. However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Daitō-ryū. At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Budō". It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society () was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.

After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by <a href="Onisaburo%20Deguchi">Onisaburo Deguchi</a>, the spiritual leader of the <a href="Oomoto">Ōmoto-kyō</a> religion (a neo-<a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> movement) in <a href="Ayabe">Ayabe</a>. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of <a href="utopia">utopia</a> during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.

In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.

Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a> with a visit to <a href="France">France</a> where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students. He was followed by <a href="Tadashi%20Abe">Tadashi Abe</a> in 1952, who came as the official <a href="Aikikai%20Hombu">Aikikai Hombu</a> representative, remaining in France for seven years. <a href="Kenji%20Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953. Later that year, <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a> was sent by Aikikai Hombu to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> for a full year, where he set up several <a href="dojo">dojo</a>. This trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by <a href="Hiroshi%20Tada">Hiroshi Tada</a>; and Germany in 1965 by <a href="Katsuaki%20Asai">Katsuaki Asai</a>. Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by Morihei Ueshiba, <a href="Masamichi%20Noro">Masamichi Noro</a> arrived in France in September 1961. <a href="Seiichi%20Sugano">Seiichi Sugano</a> was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.

The largest aikido organization is the <a href="Aikikai%20Foundation">Aikikai Foundation</a>, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.

The earliest independent styles to emerge were <a href="Yoseikan%20Aikido">Yoseikan Aikido</a>, begun by <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a> in 1931, <a href="Yoshinkan">Yoshinkan</a> Aikido, founded by <a href="Gozo%20Shioda">Gozo Shioda</a> in 1955, and <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a>, founded by <a href="Kenji%20Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> in 1967. The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.

After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the <a href="Aikikai%20Hombu%20Dojo">Aikikai Hombu Dojo</a>'s chief instructor <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a>, in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, <a href="Kisshomaru%20Ueshiba">Kisshomaru Ueshiba</a>, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of "ki" development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called <a href="Shin%20Shin%20Toitsu%20Aikido">Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido</a>, and the organization that governs it, the <a href="Ki%20Society">Ki Society</a> ("Ki no Kenkyūkai").

A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in <a href="Iwama%2C%20Ibaraki">Iwama, Ibaraki</a> and the teaching methodology of long term student <a href="Morihiro%20Saito">Morihiro Saito</a>. It is unofficially referred to as the "<a href="Iwama%20style">Iwama style</a>", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called <a href="Iwama%20Ryu">Iwama Ryu</a>. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups. One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent <a href="Shinshin%20Aikishuren%20Kai">Shinshin Aikishuren Kai</a> in 2004 around Saito's son <a href="Hitohiro%20Saito">Hitohiro Saito</a>.

Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own in Japan, and have an international breadth.

The study of "<a href="Qi">ki</a>" is an important component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both. The "<a href="kanji">kanji</a>" for "ki" normally is written as . It was written as until the <a href="T%C5%8Dy%C5%8D%20kanji">writing reforms after World War II</a>, and this older form still is seen on occasion.

The character for "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as , or . "Ki" has many meanings, including "ambience", "mind", "mood", and "intention", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to "life energy". <a href="G%C5%8Dz%C5%8D%20Shioda">Gōzō Shioda</a>'s <a href="Yoshinkan">Yoshinkan Aikido</a>, considered one of the "hard styles", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to "ki" lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point. In later years, Ueshiba's application of "ki" in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his <a href="Takemusu">Takemusu</a> Aiki and many of his later students teach about "ki" from this perspective. <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a>'s <a href="Ki%20Society">Ki Society</a> centers almost exclusively around the study of the <a href="empirical">empirical</a> (albeit subjective) experience of "ki" with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and "ki" development.

In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a>, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and <a href="Physical%20exercise">conditioning</a>, as well as specific techniques. Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of <a href="throw%20%28grappling%29">throws</a>, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and <a href="Pinning%20hold">pins</a>. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.

Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled <a href="relaxation%20technique">relaxation</a>, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, <a href="flexibility%20%28anatomy%29">flexibility</a>, and <a href="endurance">endurance</a>, with less emphasis on <a href="strength%20training">strength training</a>. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.

In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to <a href="yoga">yoga</a> or <a href="pilates">pilates</a>. For example, many dojos begin each class with , which may include <a href="stretching">stretching</a> and <a href="Uke%20%28martial%20arts%29">ukemi</a> (break falls).

Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms ("<a href="kata">kata</a>") rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ("<a href="uke%20%28martial%20arts%29">uke</a>") to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the "<a href="Tori%20%28martial%20arts%29">tori</a>", or "shite" (depending on aikido style), also referred to as "nage" (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.

Both halves of the technique, that of "uke" and that of "tori", are considered essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. "Tori" learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while "uke" learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which "tori" places them. This "receiving" of the technique is called "ukemi". "Uke" continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while "tori" uses position and timing to keep "uke" off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, "uke" will sometimes apply to regain balance and pin or throw "tori".

Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.

Many of the of aikido resemble cuts from a <a href="sword">sword</a> or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for <a href="weapon">armed</a> combat. Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches ("<a href="tsuki">tsuki</a>"), are practiced as thrusts with a <a href="knife">knife</a> or sword. <a href="Kick">Kick</a>s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:

Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a <a href="Katana">weapon</a>; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender. The following are examples of some basic grabs:

The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.

Aikido makes use of body movement ("<a href="tai%20sabaki">tai sabaki</a>") to blend with "uke". For example, an "entering" ("<a href="irimi">irimi</a>") technique consists of movements inward towards "uke", while a technique uses a pivoting motion.
Additionally, an technique takes place in front of "uke", whereas an technique takes place to their side; a technique is applied with motion to the front of "uke", and a version is applied with motion towards the rear of "uke", usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ("<a href="seiza">seiza</a>"). Techniques where both "uke" and "tori" are standing are called "tachi-waza", techniques where both start off in "seiza" are called "suwari-waza", and techniques performed with "uke" standing and "tori" sitting are called "hanmi handachi" ().

Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, "ikkyō" can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an "ura" type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an "omote-waza" version). Specific aikido "kata" are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)". For instance, "katate-dori ikkyō" refers to any "ikkyō" technique executed when "uke" is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as "katate-dori ikkyō omote", referring to any forward-moving "ikkyō" technique from that grab.

"<a href="Atemi">Atemi</a>" () are strikes (or <a href="feint">feint</a>s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view "atemi" as attacks against "<a href="pressure%20point">vital points</a>" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, <a href="Gozo%20Shioda">Gōzō Shioda</a> described using "atemi" in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader. Others consider "atemi", especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration. The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.

Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ("<a href="j%C5%8D">jō</a>") although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or <a href="J%C5%ABkend%C5%8D">Jūkendō</a>, the wooden sword ("<a href="bokken">bokken</a>"), and the knife ("<a href="tant%C5%8D">tantō</a>"). Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught. Some schools, such as the <a href="Iwama%20style">Iwama style</a> of <a href="Morihiro%20Saito">Morihiro Saito</a>, usually spend substantial time practicing with both "bokken" and "jō", under the names of "<a href="aiki-ken">aiki-ken</a>", and "<a href="aiki-j%C5%8D">aiki-jō</a>", respectively.

The founder developed many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional sword, spear and bayonet movements. Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).

One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called "taninzudori", or "taninzugake". Freestyle practice with multiple attackers called "<a href="randori">randori</a>" () is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks. "Randori" exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment. Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training. For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.

In <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a>, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo "randori".

In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of "tori" to prevent injury to "uke" by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in "ukemi". Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of "tori" misjudging the ability of "uke" to receive the throw or pin.

A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other.
Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes. Several deaths from head-and-neck injuries, caused by aggressive "shihōnage" in a <a href="Senpai%20and%20k%C5%8Dhai">senpai/kōhai</a> hazing context, have been reported.

Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations. This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness. Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation. As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.

Aikido practitioners (commonly called "aikidōka" outside Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" ("<a href="ky%C5%AB">kyū</a>"), followed by a series of "degrees" ("<a href="dan%20%28rank%29">dan</a>"), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and <a href="Black%20belt%20%28martial%20arts%29">black belts</a> to distinguish "kyu" and "dan" grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another. Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a "dan" rank unless they are 16 or older.
The uniform worn for practicing aikido ("<a href="aikidogi">aikidōgi</a>") is similar to the training uniform ("<a href="keikogi">keikogi</a>") used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("<a href="judo">judo</a>-style"), and thin ("<a href="karate">karate</a>-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.

Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or <a href="indigo">indigo</a> trousers called a "<a href="hakama">hakama</a>" (used also in <a href="Naginatajutsu">Naginatajutsu</a>, <a href="kendo">kendo</a>, and <a href="iaido">iaido</a>). In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with ("dan") ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a "hakama" regardless of rank.

The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by "uke" (and which "tori" must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak", "sloppy", and "little more than caricatures of an attack".
Weak attacks from "uke" allow for a conditioned response from "tori", and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a> addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.

Another criticism pertains to the shift in training focus after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by "tori", entering ("irimi") and initiation of techniques by "tori", the distinction between "omote" (front side) and "ura" (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.

Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of Aikido Journal, "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts." That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional "<a href="jujutsu">jujutsu</a>" or "<a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a>" are diverging from what Ueshiba taught. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated."

Astatine

Astatine is a <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol At and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 85. It is the rarest <a href="naturally%20occurring%20element">naturally occurring element</a> in the <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>, occurring only as the <a href="Decay%20chain">decay product</a> of various heavier elements. All of astatine's <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.

The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty. Many of them have been estimated based on the element's position on the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> as a heavier analog of <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and a member of the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s (the group of elements including <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> or possibly a <a href="metal">metal</a>; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several <a href="anion">anion</a>ic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable <a href="monatomic%20cation">monatomic cation</a> in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).

The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by <a href="Dale%20R.%20Corson">Dale R. Corson</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Ross%20MacKenzie">Kenneth Ross MacKenzie</a>, and <a href="Emilio%20G.%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio G. Segrè</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, who named it from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "astatos" (ἄστατος), meaning "unstable". Four <a href="isotopes%20of%20astatine">isotopes of astatine</a> were subsequently found to be naturally occurring, although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>-209 with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s.

Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have short <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, <a href="polonium">polonium</a> or <a href="radon">radon</a>. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only <a href="francium">francium</a> is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.

The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It remains to be seen if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>; metal formation has also been predicted.

Most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated (by <a href="interpolation">interpolation</a> or <a href="extrapolation">extrapolation</a>), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight – fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The <a href="melting%20point">melting</a> and <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>s of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>. On this basis they are estimated to be , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapor pressure</a>. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>. The <a href="absorption%20spectrum">absorption spectrum</a> of astatine in the <a href="Ultraviolet%23Subtypes">middle ultraviolet region</a> has lines at 224.401 and 216.225 nm, suggestive of <a href="electron%20configuration">6p to 7s</a> <a href="atomic%20electron%20transition">transitions</a>.

The structure of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine it may have an <a href="orthorhombic%20crystal%20system">orthorhombic crystalline structure</a> composed of <a href="diatomic">diatomic</a> astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a <a href="band%20gap">band gap</a> of 0.7 <a href="electronvolt">eV</a>). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic <a href="cubic%20close%20packed">face-centered cubic structure</a>; in this structure it may well be a <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a>, like the similar high-pressure phase of iodine. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state that it does not exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be , dissociation energy , and <a href="heat%20of%20vaporization">heat of vaporization</a> (∆H) 54.39 kJ/mol. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ/mol, falls just short of the threshold figure.

The chemistry of astatine is "clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted, and the possibility of reactions with impurities, walls and filters, or radioactivity by-products, and other unwanted nano-scale interactions." Many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using <a href="radioactive%20tracer">tracer</a> studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions, typically less than 10 mol·L. Some properties – such as anion formation – align with other halogens. Astatine has some metallic characteristics as well, such as <a href="electroplating">plating</a> onto a <a href="cathode">cathode</a>, <a href="Coprecipitation">coprecipitating</a> with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid, and forming a stable <a href="monatomic%20cation">monatomic cation</a> in aqueous solution. It forms complexes with <a href="EDTA">EDTA</a>, a metal <a href="chelating%20agent">chelating agent</a>, and is capable of acting as a metal in <a href="antibody">antibody</a> <a href="radioactive%20tracer">radiolabeling</a>; in some respects astatine in the +1 state is akin to silver in the same state. Most of the organic chemistry of astatine is, however, analogous to that of iodine.

Astatine has an <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a> of 2.2 on the revised <a href="Pauling%20scale">Pauling scale</a> – lower than that of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In <a href="hydrogen%20astatide">hydrogen astatide</a> (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound could be referred to as astatine hydride according to certain nomenclatures, That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the <a href="Allred%E2%80%93Rochow%20scale">Allred–Rochow scale</a> (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). However, official IUPAC stoichiometric nomenclature is based on an idealized convention of determining the relative electronegativities of the elements by the mere virtue of their position within the periodic table. According to this convention, astatine is handled as though it is more electronegative than hydrogen, irrespective of its true electronegativity. The <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a> of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a>s.

Less reactive than iodine, astatine is the least reactive of the halogens, although its <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a> have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as a carrier, the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and <a href="precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitation</a>) to work. Like iodine, astatine has been shown to adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.

Only a few compounds with metals have been reported, in the form of astatides of sodium, <a href="palladium">palladium</a>, silver, <a href="thallium">thallium</a>, and lead. Some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide, and the other hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides, have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides.

The formation of an astatine compound with hydrogen – usually referred to as hydrogen astatide – was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily <a href="oxidation%20%28chemistry%29">oxidized</a>; acidification by dilute <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> gives the At or At forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as <a href="silver%20iodide">silver(I) iodide</a>.

Astatine is known to bind to <a href="boron">boron</a>, carbon, and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. Various boron cage compounds have been prepared with At–B bonds, these being more stable than At–C bonds. Astatine can replace a hydrogen atom in <a href="benzene">benzene</a> to form astatobenzene CHAt; this may be oxidized to CHAtCl by chlorine. By treating this compound with an <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">alkaline</a> solution of hypochlorite, CHAtO can be produced. The dipyridine-astatine(I) cation, [At(CHN)], forms <a href="ionic%20compound">ionic compound</a>s with <a href="perchlorate">perchlorate</a> (a <a href="non-coordinating%20anion">non-coordinating anion</a>) and with <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, [At(CHN)]NO. This cation exists as a <a href="coordination%20complex">coordination complex</a> in which two <a href="dative%20covalent%20bond">dative covalent bond</a>s separately link the astatine(I) centre with each of the <a href="pyridine">pyridine</a> rings via their nitrogen atoms.

With oxygen, there is evidence of the species AtO and AtO in aqueous solution, formed by the reaction of astatine with an oxidant such as elemental bromine or (in the last case) by <a href="sodium%20persulfate">sodium persulfate</a> in a solution of <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a>. The species previously thought to be has since been determined to be , a hydrolysis product of AtO (another such hydrolysis product being AtOOH). The well characterized anion can be obtained by, for example, the oxidation of astatine with potassium hypochlorite in a solution of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>. Preparation of <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> triastatate La(AtO), following the oxidation of astatine by a hot NaSO solution, has been reported. Further oxidation of , such as by <a href="xenon%20difluoride">xenon difluoride</a> (in a hot alkaline solution) or <a href="periodate">periodate</a> (in a <a href="neutral%20solution">neutral</a> or alkaline solution), yields the perastatate ion ; this is only stable in neutral or alkaline solutions. Astatine is also thought to be capable of forming cations in salts with oxyanions such as <a href="iodate">iodate</a> or <a href="dichromate">dichromate</a>; this is based on the observation that, in acidic solutions, monovalent or intermediate positive states of astatine coprecipitate with the insoluble salts of metal cations such as silver(I) iodate or thallium(I) dichromate.

Astatine may form bonds to the other <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>s; these include SAt and with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, a coordination <a href="selenourea">selenourea</a> compound with <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and an astatine–<a href="tellurium">tellurium</a> <a href="colloid">colloid</a> with tellurium.

Astatine is known to react with its lighter homologs iodine, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> in the vapor state; these reactions produce diatomic <a href="interhalogen%20compound">interhalogen compound</a>s with formulas AtI, AtBr, and AtCl. The first two compounds may also be produced in water – astatine reacts with iodine/<a href="iodide">iodide</a> solution to form AtI, whereas AtBr requires (aside from astatine) an iodine/<a href="iodine%20monobromide">iodine monobromide</a>/<a href="bromide">bromide</a> solution. The excess of iodides or bromides may lead to and ions, or in a chloride solution, they may produce species like or via equilibrium reactions with the chlorides. Oxidation of the element with dichromate (in nitric acid solution) showed that adding chloride turned the astatine into a molecule likely to be either AtCl or AtOCl. Similarly, or may be produced. The polyhalides PdAtI, CsAtI, TlAtI, and PbAtI are known or presumed to have been precipitated. In a plasma ion source <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a>, the ions [AtI], [AtBr], and [AtCl] have been formed by introducing lighter halogen vapors into a <a href="helium">helium</a>-filled cell containing astatine, supporting the existence of stable neutral molecules in the plasma ion state. No astatine fluorides have been discovered yet. Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds, including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non-volatile product. Thus, although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible, it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent, as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluoride.

In 1869, when <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> published his <a href="Periodic%20table%23Mendeleev%27s%20table">periodic table</a>, the space under iodine was empty; after <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements, it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there. Before its officially recognized discovery, it was called "eka-iodine" (from <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "eka" – "one") to imply it was one space under iodine (in the same manner as <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">eka-silicon, eka-boron, and others</a>). Scientists tried to find it in nature; given its extreme rarity, these attempts resulted in several false discoveries.

The first claimed discovery of eka-iodine was made by <a href="Fred%20Allison">Fred Allison</a> and his associates at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a>) in 1931. The discoverers named element 85 "alabamine", and assigned it the symbol Ab, designations that were used for a few years. In 1934, <a href="Herbert%20G.%20MacPherson">H. G. MacPherson</a> of <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> disproved Allison's method and the validity of his discovery. There was another claim in 1937, by the chemist Rajendralal De. Working in Dacca in <a href="British%20India">British India</a> (now <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> in <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>), he chose the name "dakin" for element 85, which he claimed to have isolated as the <a href="thorium%20series">thorium series</a> equivalent of <a href="Radium%23History">radium F</a> (polonium-210) in the <a href="radium%20series">radium series</a>. The properties he reported for dakin do not correspond to those of astatine; moreover, astatine is not found in the thorium series, and the true identity of dakin is not known.

In 1936, a team of Romanian physicist <a href="Horia%20Hulubei">Horia Hulubei</a> and French physicist <a href="Yvette%20Cauchois">Yvette Cauchois</a> claimed to have discovered element 85 via X-ray analysis. In 1939, they published another paper which supported and extended previous data. In 1944, Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time, claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers. He chose the name "dor", presumably from the Romanian for "longing" [for peace], as <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> had started five years earlier. As Hulubei was writing in French, a language which does not accommodate the "ine" suffix, dor would likely have been rendered in English as "dorine", had it been adopted. In 1947, Hulubei's claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist <a href="Friedrich%20Paneth">Friedrich Paneth</a>, who would later chair the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> committee responsible for recognition of new elements. Even though Hulubei's samples did contain astatine, his means to detect it were too weak, by current standards, to enable correct identification. He had also been involved in an earlier <a href="Francium%23Erroneous%20and%20incomplete%20discoveries">false claim</a> as to the discovery of element 87 (francium) and this is thought to have caused other researchers to downplay his work.
In 1940, the Swiss chemist <a href="Walter%20Minder">Walter Minder</a> announced the discovery of element 85 as the beta <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a> of radium A (polonium-218), choosing the name "helvetium" (from , the Latin name of Switzerland). Karlik and Bernert were unsuccessful in reproducing his experiments, and subsequently attributed Minder's results to contamination of his radon stream (radon-222 is the parent isotope of polonium-218). In 1942, Minder, in collaboration with the English scientist Alice Leigh-Smith, announced the discovery of another isotope of element 85, presumed to be the product of <a href="Thorium%23History">thorium A</a> (polonium-216) beta decay. They named this substance "anglo-helvetium", but Karlik and Bernert were again unable to reproduce these results.

Later in 1940, <a href="Dale%20R.%20Corson">Dale R. Corson</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Ross%20MacKenzie">Kenneth Ross MacKenzie</a>, and <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> isolated the element at the University of California, Berkeley. Instead of searching for the element in nature, the scientists created it by bombarding <a href="bismuth-209">bismuth-209</a> with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s in a <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> (particle accelerator) to produce, after emission of two neutrons, astatine-211. The discoverers, however, did not immediately suggest a name for the element. The reason for this was that at the time, an element created synthetically in "invisible quantities" that had not yet discovered in nature was not seen as a completely valid one; in addition, chemists were reluctant to recognize radioactive isotopes as legitimately as stable ones. In 1943, astatine was found as a product of two naturally occurring <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a>s by <a href="Berta%20Karlik">Berta Karlik</a> and Traude Bernert, first in the so-called <a href="Decay%20chain%23Uranium%20series">uranium series</a>, and then in the <a href="Decay%20chain%23Actinium%20series">actinium series</a>. (Since then, astatine has been determined in a third decay chain, the <a href="Decay%20chain%23Neptunium%20series">neptunium series</a>.) Friedrich Paneth in 1946 called to finally recognize synthetic elements, quoting, among other reasons, recent confirmation of their natural occurrence, and proposed that the discoverers of the newly discovered unnamed elements name these elements. In early 1947, "<a href="Nature">Nature</a>" published the discoverers' suggestions; a letter from Corson, MacKenzie, and Segrè suggested the name "astatine" coming from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "astatos" (αστατος) meaning "unstable", because of its propensity for <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>, with the ending "-ine", found in the names of the four previously discovered halogens. The name was also chosen to continue the tradition of the four stable halogens, where the name referred to a property of the element.

Corson and his colleagues classified astatine as a metal on the basis of its <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analytical chemistry</a>. Subsequent investigators reported iodine-like, cationic, or <a href="Amphoterism">amphoteric</a> behavior. In a 2003 retrospective, Corson wrote that "some of the properties [of astatine] are similar to iodine … it also exhibits metallic properties, more like its metallic neighbors Po and Bi."

There are 39 known <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of astatine, with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191–229. Theoretical modeling suggests that 37 more isotopes could exist. No stable or long-lived astatine isotope has been observed, nor is one expected to exist.

Astatine's <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite <a href="Alpha%20particle%23Energy%20and%20absorption">high energies</a> of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a <a href="magic%20number%20%28physics%29">magic number</a> corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1 hours for astatine-210 and 7.2 hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay, though nuclear mass measurements reveal that At is in fact <a href="beta-stable">beta-stable</a>, as it has the lowest mass of all <a href="isobar%20%28nuclide%29">isobars</a> with "A" = 215. A beta decay mode has been found for all other astatine isotopes except for astatine-213, astatine-214, and astatine-216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (<a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>.

The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1 hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter <a href="polonium-210">polonium-210</a>. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived <a href="bismuth-209">bismuth-209</a>.

Astatine has 24 known <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s, which are nuclei with one or more <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s (<a href="proton">proton</a>s or <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s) in an <a href="excited%20state">excited state</a>. A nuclear isomer may also be called a "<a href="metastability">meta</a>-state", meaning the system has more <a href="internal%20energy">internal energy</a> than the "<a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>" (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1, which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all the ground states bar those of isotopes 203–211 and 220. The least stable is astatine-214m1; its half-life of 265 <a href="nanosecond">nanosecond</a>s is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine-213.

Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element. The total amount of astatine in the Earth's crust (quoted mass 2.36 × 10 grams) is estimated to be less than one gram at any given time.

Any astatine present at the formation of the Earth has long since disappeared; the four naturally occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced as a result of the <a href="decay%20chain">decay</a> of radioactive <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> ores, and trace quantities of <a href="neptunium-237">neptunium-237</a>. The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in <a href="uranium%20ore">uranium ore</a>s. Astatine-218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes.

Isotopes of astatine are sometimes not listed as naturally occurring because of misconceptions that there are no such isotopes, or discrepancies in the literature. Astatine-216 has been counted as a naturally occurring isotope but reports of its observation (which were described as doubtful) have not been confirmed.

Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6 <a href="giga-">giga</a> <a href="becquerel">becquerel</a>s (about 86 <a href="nanogram">nanogram</a>s or 2.47 × 10 atoms). Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons and the prospect of melting the target. Solvent <a href="radiolysis">radiolysis</a> due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem. With cryogenic technology, <a href="microgram">microgram</a> quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of <a href="thorium">thorium</a> or <a href="uranium">uranium</a> to yield radon-211, in turn decaying to astatine-211. Contamination with astatine-210 is expected to be a drawback of this method.

The most important isotope is astatine-211, the only one in commercial use. To produce the bismuth target, the metal is <a href="sputtering">sputtered</a> onto a gold, copper, or aluminium surface at 50 to 100 milligrams per square centimeter. <a href="Bismuth%20oxide">Bismuth oxide</a> can be used instead; this is forcibly fused with a copper plate. The target is kept under a <a href="Nitrogen%20gas%23Reactions">chemically neutral nitrogen</a> atmosphere, and is cooled with water to prevent premature astatine vaporization. In a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron, alpha particles are collided with the bismuth. Even though only one bismuth isotope is used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211. In order to eliminate undesired nuclides, the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to a value (optimally 29.17 MeV) above that for the reaction producing astatine-211 (to produce the desired isotope) and below the one producing astatine-210 (to avoid producing other astatine isotopes).

Since astatine is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and any significant contaminants. Several methods are available, "but they generally follow one of two approaches—dry distillation or [wet] acid treatment of the target followed by solvent extraction." The methods summarized below are modern adaptations of older procedures, as reviewed by Kugler and Keller. Pre-1985 techniques more often addressed the elimination of co-produced toxic polonium; this requirement is now mitigated by capping the energy of the cyclotron irradiation beam.

The astatine-containing cyclotron target is heated to a temperature of around 650 °C. The astatine <a href="Volatilization">volatilizes</a> and is condensed in (typically) a <a href="cold%20trap">cold trap</a>. Higher temperatures of up to around 850 °C may increase the yield, at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth (as bismuth can interfere with astatine <a href="radioactive%20tracer">labeling reactions</a>). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>, <a href="methanol">methanol</a> or <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.

The bismuth (or sometimes <a href="bismuth%20trioxide">bismuth trioxide</a>) target is dissolved in, for example, concentrated nitric or perchloric acid. Astatine is extracted using an organic solvent such as <a href="dibutyl%20ether">butyl</a> or <a href="isopropyl%20ether">isopropyl ether</a>, or <a href="thiosemicarbazide">thiosemicarbazide</a>. A separation yield of 93% using nitric acid has been reported, falling to 72% by the time purification procedures were completed (distillation of nitric acid, purging residual <a href="nitrogen%20oxide">nitrogen oxide</a>s, and redissolving <a href="bismuth%20nitrate">bismuth nitrate</a> to enable <a href="liquid%E2%80%93liquid%20extraction">liquid–liquid extraction</a>). Wet methods involve "multiple radioactivity handling steps" and are not well suited for isolating larger quantities of astatine. They can enable the production of astatine in a specific <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> and may have greater applicability in experimental <a href="radiochemistry">radiochemistry</a>.

Newly formed astatine-211 is the subject of ongoing research in <a href="nuclear%20medicine">nuclear medicine</a>. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2 hours; this is long enough to permit <a href="radioactive%20tracer">multistep labeling strategies</a>. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay), very quickly reaching its stable granddaughter lead-207. Polonium X-rays emitted as a result of the electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92 <a href="electronvolt">keV</a>, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.

The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and <a href="iodine-131">iodine-131</a> (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70 µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2 mm. The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the "tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located in close proximity to essential normal tissues." Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.
Several obstacles have been encountered in the development of astatine-based <a href="radiopharmaceuticals">radiopharmaceuticals</a> for <a href="cancer">cancer</a> treatment. <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that <a href="Monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibodies</a> became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to <a href="dehalogenation">dehalogenate</a> from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at <a href="Orbital%20hybridisation%23sp3">sp carbon sites</a> (less so from <a href="Orbital%20hybridisation%23sp2">sp sites</a>). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a "staggering" number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.

Animal studies show that astatine, similarly to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the <a href="thyroid%20gland">thyroid gland</a>. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a tendency to be taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At to At. If administered in the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the <a href="liver">liver</a>. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell <a href="dysplasia">dysplasia</a> within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.

Atom

An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary <a href="matter">matter</a> that has the properties of a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>. Every <a href="solid">solid</a>, <a href="liquid">liquid</a>, <a href="gas">gas</a>, and <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> is composed of neutral or <a href="ionized">ionized</a> atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100 <a href="picometer">picometer</a>s (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the <a href="short%20scale">short scale</a>).

Atoms <a href="Matter%20wave%23The%20de%20Broglie%20hypothesis">are small enough</a> that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were <a href="billiard%20ball">billiard ball</a>s, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum effects</a>. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated <a href="%23Further%20developments%20in%20quantum%20physics">quantum principles</a> to better explain and predict this behavior.

Every atom is composed of a <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> and one or more <a href="electron">electron</a>s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more <a href="proton">proton</a>s and typically a similar number of <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. Protons and neutrons are called <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s. More than 99.94% of an atom's <a href="mass">mass</a> is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an <a href="ion">ion</a>.

The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, the <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a>, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: <a href="nuclear%20decay">nuclear decay</a> resulting in <a href="nuclear%20transmutation">nuclear transmutation</a>.

The number of protons in the nucleus defines to what <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> the atom belongs: for example, all <a href="copper">copper</a> atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of the element. The number of electrons influences the <a href="magnetic">magnetic</a> properties of an atom. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>s to form <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>s such as <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>.

The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word "atom" (; ""), meaning "uncuttable", was coined by the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">ancient Greek philosophers</a> <a href="Leucippus">Leucippus</a> and his pupil <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> ( 460 – 370 BC). Democritus taught that atoms were infinite in number, uncreated, and eternal, and that the qualities of an object result from the kind of atoms that compose it. Democritus's atomism was refined and elaborated by the later philosopher <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a> (341–270 BC). During the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>, atomism was mostly forgotten in western Europe, but survived among some groups of Islamic philosophers. During the twelfth century, atomism became known again in western Europe through references to it in the newly-rediscovered writings of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>.

In the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of major works describing atomist teachings, including <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>'s "<a href="De%20rerum%20natura">De rerum natura</a>" and <a href="Diogenes%20La%C3%ABrtius">Diogenes Laërtius</a>'s "<a href="Lives%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Eminent%20Philosophers">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</a>", led to increased scholarly attention on the subject. Nonetheless, because atomism was associated with the philosophy of <a href="Epicureanism">Epicureanism</a>, which contradicted orthodox Christian teachings, belief in atoms was not considered acceptable. The French Catholic priest <a href="Pierre%20Gassendi">Pierre Gassendi</a> (1592–1655) revived Epicurean atomism with modifications, arguing that atoms were created by God and, though extremely numerous, are not infinite. Gassendi's modified theory of atoms was popularized in France by the physician <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bernier">François Bernier</a> (1620–1688) and in England by the natural philosopher <a href="Walter%20Charleton">Walter Charleton</a> (1619–1707). The chemist <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> (1627–1691) and the physicist <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> (1642–1727) both defended atomism and, by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become accepted by portions of the scientific community.

In the early 1800s, <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a> used the concept of atoms to explain why <a href="Chemical%20element">elements</a> always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the <a href="law%20of%20multiple%20proportions">law of multiple proportions</a>). For instance, there are two types of <a href="tin%20oxide%20%28disambiguation%29">tin oxide</a>: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (<a href="tin%28II%29%20oxide">tin(II) oxide</a> and <a href="tin%20dioxide">tin dioxide</a> respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in multiples of discrete units — in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.

Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> far better than it absorbs <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N).

In 1827, <a href="Botany">botanist</a> <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as "<a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first <a href="statistical%20physics">statistical physics</a> analysis of <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>. French physicist <a href="Jean%20Perrin">Jean Perrin</a> used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying <a href="Dalton%27s%20atomic%20theory">Dalton's atomic theory</a>.

The physicist <a href="J.J.%20Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a> measured the mass of <a href="cathode%20ray">cathode ray</a>s, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first "<a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic</a>" particle to be discovered, which he originally called ""<a href="wikt%3Acorpuscle">corpuscle</a>"" but was later named "electron", after particles postulated by <a href="George%20Johnstone%20Stoney">George Johnstone Stoney</a> in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by <a href="Photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric</a> and radioactive materials. It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a>s in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter. Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the <a href="plum%20pudding%20model">plum pudding model</a>.

In 1909, <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Marsden">Ernest Marsden</a>, under the direction of <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, bombarded a metal foil with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.

While experimenting with the products of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>, in 1913 <a href="radiochemistry">radiochemist</a> <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. The term <a href="isotope">isotope</a> was coined by <a href="Margaret%20Todd%20%28doctor%29">Margaret Todd</a> as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for <a href="isotope%20separation">isotope separation</a> through his work on <a href="ionized%20gas">ionized gas</a>es, which subsequently led to the discovery of <a href="stable%20isotope">stable isotope</a>s.

In 1913 the physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see "<a href="synchrotron%20radiation">synchrotron radiation</a>") and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.

Later in the same year <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a> provided additional experimental evidence in favor of <a href="Bohr%20model">Niels Bohr's theory</a>. These results refined <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>'s and <a href="Antonius%20Van%20den%20Broek">Antonius Van den Broek</a>'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> a number of positive <a href="nuclear%20charge">nuclear charge</a>s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.

<a href="Chemical%20bond">Chemical bond</a>s between atoms were now explained, by <a href="Gilbert%20Newton%20Lewis">Gilbert Newton Lewis</a> in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons. As the <a href="Chemical%20property">chemical properties</a> of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the <a href="periodic%20law">periodic law</a>, in 1919 the American chemist <a href="Irving%20Langmuir">Irving Langmuir</a> suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>s about the nucleus.

The <a href="Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach%20experiment">Stern–Gerlach experiment</a> of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>. As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction. Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field.

In 1925 <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics (<a href="Matrix%20Mechanics">Matrix Mechanics</a>). One year earlier, in 1924, <a href="Louis%20de%20Broglie">Louis de Broglie</a> had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926, <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom (Wave Mechanics) that described the electrons as three-dimensional <a href="waveform">waveform</a>s rather than point particles.

A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the <a href="Point%20%28geometry%29">position</a> and <a href="momentum">momentum</a> of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a>, formulated by <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> in 1927. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.
This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and <a href="Spectral%20line">spectral</a> patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a> zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.

The development of the <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a> allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist <a href="Francis%20William%20Aston">Francis William Aston</a> used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the <a href="whole%20number%20rule">whole number rule</a>. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the <a href="proton">proton</a>, by the physicist <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.

In 1938, the German chemist <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a>, a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a>s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed <a href="barium">barium</a> as a product. A year later, <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and her nephew <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental "nuclear fission". In 1944, Hahn received the <a href="Nobel%20prize">Nobel prize</a> in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.

In the 1950s, the development of improved <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s and <a href="particle%20detector">particle detector</a>s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons were found to be <a href="hadron">hadron</a>s, or composites of smaller particles called <a href="quark">quark</a>s. The <a href="standard%20model%20of%20particle%20physics">standard model of particle physics</a> was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.

Though the word "atom" originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s. The constituent particles of an atom are the <a href="electron">electron</a>, the <a href="proton">proton</a> and the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>; all three are <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s. However, the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen-1</a> atom has no neutrons and the <a href="hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydron ion</a> has no electrons.

The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at , with a negative <a href="Electric%20charge">electrical charge</a> and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a> mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an <a href="ion">ion</a>. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to <a href="J.J.%20Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a>; see <a href="history%20of%20subatomic%20physics">history of subatomic physics</a> for details.

Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at . The number of protons in an atom is called its <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>. <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it <a href="proton">proton</a>.

Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron, or , the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the <a href="nuclear%20binding%20energy">nuclear binding energy</a>. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s) have comparable dimensions—on the order of —although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>.

In the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s called <a href="quark">quark</a>s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two <a href="up%20quark">up quark</a>s (each with charge +) and one <a href="down%20quark">down quark</a> (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.

The quarks are held together by the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a> (or strong force), which is mediated by <a href="gluon">gluon</a>s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a>, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of <a href="gauge%20boson">gauge boson</a>s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>, and are collectively called <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07  <a href="femtometre">fm</a>, where "A" is the total number of nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10 fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the <a href="residual%20strong%20force">residual strong force</a>. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the <a href="electrostatic%20force">electrostatic force</a> that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.

Atoms of the same <a href="chemical%20element">element</a> have the same number of protons, called the <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a>. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>.

The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s. Fermions obey the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a> which prohibits "<a href="identical%20particles">identical</a>" fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.

A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. <a href="Nuclear%20fusion">Nuclear fusion</a> occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the <a href="coulomb%20barrier">coulomb barrier</a>—and fuse together into a single nucleus. <a href="Nuclear%20fission">Nuclear fission</a> is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>, or the kinetic energy of a <a href="beta%20particle">beta particle</a>), as described by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> formula, "E" = "mc", where "m" is the mass loss and "c" is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. This deficit is part of the <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an <a href="exothermic%20reaction">exothermic process</a> that releases more energy than is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in <a href="star">star</a>s a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a> in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>es higher than about 60, is an <a href="endothermic%20reaction">endothermic process</a>. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the <a href="hydrostatic%20equilibrium">hydrostatic equilibrium</a> of a star.

The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>. This force binds the electrons inside an <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a> <a href="potential%20well">potential well</a> surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a <a href="Wave%E2%80%93particle%20duality">particle and a wave</a>. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional <a href="standing%20wave">standing wave</a>—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured. Only a discrete (or <a href="wikt%3Aquantize">quantized</a>) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form. Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a> of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a <a href="photon">photon</a> with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through <a href="spontaneous%20emission">spontaneous emission</a>, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for <a href="atomic%20spectral%20line">atomic spectral line</a>s.

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the <a href="electron%20binding%20energy">electron binding energy</a>—is far less than the <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy of nucleons</a>. For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a <a href="Stationary%20state">ground-state</a> electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23 "million" eV for splitting a <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> nucleus. Atoms are <a href="electric%20charge">electrically</a> neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called <a href="ion">ion</a>s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to <a href="chemical%20bond">bond</a> into <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s and other types of <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>s like <a href="Ionic%20crystal">ionic</a> and <a href="Covalent%20bond">covalent</a> network <a href="Crystallization">crystals</a>.

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of "protons" in their nuclei belong to the same <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of "neutrons" are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (<a href="hydrogen-1">hydrogen-1</a>, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (<a href="deuterium">deuterium</a>), two neutrons (<a href="tritium">tritium</a>) and <a href="isotopes%20of%20hydrogen">more than two neutrons</a>. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> up to the 118-proton element <a href="oganesson">oganesson</a>. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (<a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>) is so slight as to be practically negligible.

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "<a href="stable%20isotope">stable isotope</a>s". However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even <a href="list%20of%20nuclides">in theory</a>. Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as "stable". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as <a href="primordial%20nuclide">primordial nuclide</a>s. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as <a href="radium">radium</a> from <a href="uranium">uranium</a>), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one <a href="stable%20isotope">stable isotope</a> exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element <a href="tin">tin</a>. Elements <a href="technetium">43</a>, <a href="promethium">61</a>, and all elements numbered <a href="bismuth">83</a> or higher have no stable isotopes.

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the <a href="Nuclear%20shell%20model">shell model</a> of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons "and" odd number of neutrons: <a href="hydrogen-2">hydrogen-2</a> (<a href="deuterium">deuterium</a>), <a href="lithium-6">lithium-6</a>, <a href="boron-10">boron-10</a> and <a href="nitrogen-14">nitrogen-14</a>. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a>, <a href="vanadium-50">vanadium-50</a>, <a href="lanthanum-138">lanthanum-138</a> and <a href="tantalum-180m">tantalum-180m</a>. Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to <a href="Semi-empirical%20mass%20formula%23Pairing%20term">nuclear pairing effects</a>.

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in a given atom is called the <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a>. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is "carbon-12," which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).

The actual <a href="Invariant%20mass">mass of an atom at rest</a> is often expressed using the <a href="Atomic%20mass%20unit">unified atomic mass unit</a> (u), also called dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of <a href="carbon-12">carbon-12</a>, which is approximately . <a href="hydrogen%20atom">Hydrogen-1</a> (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 u. The value of this number is called the <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14 u). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below). The heaviest <a href="stable%20atom">stable atom</a> is lead-208, with a mass of .

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of <a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">moles</a>. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about <a href="Avogadro%20constant"></a>). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the <a href="Atomic%20mass%20unit">unified atomic mass unit</a>, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.

Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a>. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (<a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a>) and a <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> property known as <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>. On the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 <a href="Picometre">pm</a>, while one of the largest is <a href="caesium">caesium</a> at 225 pm.

When subjected to external forces, like <a href="electrical%20field">electrical field</a>s, the shape of an atom may deviate from <a href="spherical%20symmetry">spherical symmetry</a>. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by <a href="group%20theory">group-theoretical</a> considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at <a href="crystal%20symmetry">low-symmetry</a> lattice sites. Significant <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>al deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a> ions in <a href="pyrite">pyrite</a>-type compounds.

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of <a href="light">light</a> (400–700 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>) so they cannot be viewed using an <a href="optical%20microscope">optical microscope</a>. However, individual atoms can be observed using a <a href="scanning%20tunneling%20microscope">scanning tunneling microscope</a>. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width. A single drop of water contains about 2 <a href="sextillion">sextillion</a> () atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms. A single <a href="Carat%20%28unit%29">carat</a> <a href="diamond">diamond</a> with a mass of contains about 10 sextillion (10) atoms of <a href="carbon">carbon</a>. If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:

Other more rare types of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s from a nucleus, or more than one <a href="beta%20particle">beta particle</a>. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is <a href="internal%20conversion">internal conversion</a>—a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>.

Each <a href="radioactive%20isotope">radioactive isotope</a> has a characteristic decay time period—the <a href="half-life">half-life</a>—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an <a href="exponential%20decay">exponential decay</a> process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>. This is analogous to the <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> of an object that is spinning around its <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a>, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced <a href="Planck%20constant">Planck constant</a> (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ, or "spin-½". In an atom, electrons in motion around the <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> possess orbital <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.

The <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> produced by an atom—its <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a>—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, in which no two electrons may be found in the same <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.

In <a href="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a> elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an <a href="exchange%20interaction">exchange interaction</a>. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. <a href="Paramagnetism">Paramagnetic materials</a> have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.

The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of <a href="thermal%20equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a>. However, for certain elements (such as <a href="xenon">xenon-129</a>) it is possible to <a href="spin%20polarization">polarize</a> a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called <a href="hyperpolarization%20%28physics%29">hyperpolarization</a>. This has important applications in <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>.

The <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> of an electron in an atom is <a href="negative%20number">negative</a>, its dependence of its <a href="position%20%28vector%29">position</a> reaches the <a href="minimum">minimum</a> (the most <a href="absolute%20value">absolute value</a>) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the <a href="distance">distance</a> from the nucleus <a href="limit%20at%20infinity">goes to infinity</a>, roughly in an <a href="inverse%20proportion">inverse proportion</a> to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of <a href="quantum%20state">states</a> centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>; see <a href="time-independent%20Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">time-independent Schrödinger equation</a> for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the <a href="ionization%20potential">amount of energy needed to unbind</a> the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of <a href="electronvolt">electronvolt</a>s (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. <a href="stationary%20state">stationary state</a>, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state. The electron's energy raises when "<a href="principal%20quantum%20number">n</a>" increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on <a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number"></a> is caused not by <a href="electrostatic%20potential">electrostatic potential</a> of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.

For an electron to <a href="atomic%20electron%20transition">transition between two different states</a>, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (<a href="ionization">ionization</a>), it must absorb or emit a <a href="photon">photon</a> at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> model, what can be precisely calculated by the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a>.
Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see <a href="Atomic%20orbital">Electron properties</a>.

The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its <a href="frequency">frequency</a>, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.

When a continuous <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum of energy</a> is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark <a href="absorption%20band">absorption band</a>s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) <a href="Spectroscopy">Spectroscopic</a> measurements of the strength and width of <a href="atomic%20spectral%20line">atomic spectral line</a>s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a <a href="fine%20structure">fine structure</a> splitting. This occurs because of <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20coupling">spin–orbit coupling</a>, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the <a href="Zeeman%20effect">Zeeman effect</a>. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a> can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the <a href="Stark%20effect">Stark effect</a>.

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause <a href="stimulated%20emission">stimulated emission</a> of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make <a href="laser">laser</a>s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.

Valency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds. The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the <a href="valence%20shell">valence shell</a>, and the electrons in
that shell are called <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. The number of valence electrons determines the <a href="chemical%20bond">bonding</a>
behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to <a href="Chemical%20reaction">chemically react</a> with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells. For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the <a href="organic%20compounds">organic compounds</a>.

The <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s are often displayed in a <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es.

Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and <a href="pressure">pressure</a>. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between <a href="solid">solid</a>s, <a href="liquid">liquid</a>s, <a href="gas">gas</a>es and <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasmas</a>. Within a state, a material can also exist in different <a href="allotropes">allotropes</a>. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as <a href="graphite">graphite</a> or <a href="diamond">diamond</a>. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as <a href="dioxygen">dioxygen</a> and <a href="ozone">ozone</a>.

At temperatures close to <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a>, atoms can form a <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose–Einstein condensate</a>, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale. This super-cooled collection of atoms
then behaves as a single <a href="super%20atom">super atom</a>, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.

The <a href="scanning%20tunneling%20microscope">scanning tunneling microscope</a> is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the <a href="quantum%20tunneling">quantum tunneling</a> phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an <a href="adsorb">adsorb</a>ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the <a href="Fermi%20level">Fermi level</a> <a href="local%20density%20of%20states">local density of states</a>.

An atom can be <a href="ion">ion</a>ized by removing one of its electrons. The <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a> uses this principle to measure the <a href="mass-to-charge%20ratio">mass-to-charge ratio</a> of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include <a href="inductively%20coupled%20plasma%20atomic%20emission%20spectroscopy">inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy</a> and <a href="inductively%20coupled%20plasma%20mass%20spectrometry">inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry</a>, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.

A more area-selective method is <a href="electron%20energy%20loss%20spectroscopy">electron energy loss spectroscopy</a>, which measures the energy loss of an <a href="electron%20beam">electron beam</a> within a <a href="transmission%20electron%20microscope">transmission electron microscope</a> when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The <a href="atom%20probe">atom-probe tomograph</a> has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Spectra of <a href="excited%20state">excited state</a>s can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant <a href="star">star</a>s. Specific light <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a <a href="gas-discharge%20lamp">gas-discharge lamp</a> containing the same element. <a href="Helium">Helium</a> was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23 years before it was found on Earth.

Atoms form about 4% of the total energy density of the <a href="observable%20Universe">observable Universe</a>, with an average density of about 0.25 atoms/m. Within a galaxy such as the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> (ISM) ranging from 10 to 10 atoms/m. The Sun is believed to be inside the <a href="Local%20Bubble">Local Bubble</a>, a region of highly ionized gas, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 10 atoms/m. Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about 10% of the mass of the galaxy. (The remainder of the mass is an unknown <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>.)

Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>. Atomic nuclei forms in <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> reactions. In about three minutes <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a> produced most of the <a href="helium">helium</a>, <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, and <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> in the Universe, and perhaps some of the <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> and <a href="boron">boron</a>.

Ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a>, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the <a href="temperature">temperature</a> is much higher than <a href="ionization%20potential">ionization potential</a>, the matter exists in the form of <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become <a href="statistical%20physics">statistically</a> favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over <a href="electric%20charge">charged</a> <a href="particle">particle</a>s 380,000 years after the Big Bang—an epoch called <a href="recombination%20%28cosmology%29">recombination</a>, when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.

Since the Big Bang, which produced no <a href="carbon">carbon</a> or <a href="atomic%20number">heavier elements</a>, atomic nuclei have been combined in <a href="star">star</a>s through the process of <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> to produce more of the element <a href="helium">helium</a>, and (via the <a href="triple%20alpha%20process">triple alpha process</a>) the sequence of elements from carbon up to <a href="iron">iron</a>; see <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> for details.

Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through <a href="cosmic%20ray%20spallation">cosmic ray spallation</a>. This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.

Elements heavier than iron were produced in <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e through the <a href="r-process">r-process</a> and in <a href="Asymptotic%20giant%20branch">AGB stars</a> through the <a href="s-process">s-process</a>, both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei. Elements such as <a href="lead">lead</a> formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.

Most of the atoms that make up the <a href="Earth">Earth</a> and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the <a href="nebula">nebula</a> that collapsed out of a <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a> to form the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the <a href="age%20of%20the%20Earth">age of the Earth</a> through <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>. Most of the <a href="helium">helium</a> in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>) is a product of <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a>.

There are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning (i.e., not "primordial"), nor are results of radioactive decay. <a href="Carbon-14">Carbon-14</a> is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions. Of the <a href="Transuranium%20element">transuranic elements</a>—those with atomic numbers greater than 92—only <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> and <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> occur naturally on Earth. Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of <a href="plutonium-244">plutonium-244</a> possibly deposited by cosmic dust. Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> in uranium ore.

The Earth contains approximately atoms. Although small numbers of independent atoms of <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es exist, such as <a href="argon">argon</a>, <a href="neon">neon</a>, and <a href="helium">helium</a>, 99% of <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">the atmosphere</a> is bound in the form of molecules, including <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="Diatomic%20molecule">diatomic</a> <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including <a href="water">water</a>, <a href="salt">salt</a>, <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s and <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s and liquid or solid <a href="metal">metal</a>s. This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.

While isotopes with atomic numbers higher than <a href="lead">lead</a> (82) are known to be radioactive, an "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay. The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom, <a href="unbihexium">unbihexium</a>, has 126 protons and 184 neutrons.

Each particle of matter has a corresponding <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the <a href="positron">positron</a> is a positively charged <a href="antielectron">antielectron</a> and the <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a> is a negatively charged equivalent of a <a href="proton">proton</a>. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of <a href="baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a> may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (<a href="antihydrogen">antihydrogen</a>) was synthesized at the <a href="CERN">CERN</a> laboratory in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>.

Other <a href="exotic%20atom">exotic atom</a>s have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive <a href="muon">muon</a>, forming a <a href="muonic%20atom">muonic atom</a>. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.

Apatosaurus

Apatosaurus (; meaning "deceptive lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in <a href="Laurentia">North America</a> during the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a>. <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> described and named the first-known species, A. ajax, in 1877, and a second species, A. louisae, was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. "Apatosaurus" lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the late <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> to early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> age, and are now known from <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s in the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> of modern-day <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in the United States. "Apatosaurus" had an average length of , and an average mass of . A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11–30% greater than average and a mass of .

The <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a> of "Apatosaurus" are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", a <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a> like "Apatosaurus", and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that "Apatosaurus" was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. "Apatosaurus" had a single <a href="claw">claw</a> on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The "Apatosaurus" skull, long thought to be similar to "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>", is much more similar to that of "Diplodocus". "Apatosaurus" was a generalized <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a> that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, "Apatosaurus" had <a href="air%20sacs">air sacs</a> that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.

The skull of "Apatosaurus" was confused with that of "Camarasaurus" and "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>" until 1909, when the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "A. louisae" was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of "Apatosaurus" with a "Camarasaurus" skull cast. Until 1970, "Apatosaurus" skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to "Diplodocus" were more likely from "Apatosaurus".

"Apatosaurus" is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> genera, with only "<a href="Amphicoelias">Amphicoelias</a>" and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a> was named in 1929, the group was not used <a href="valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">validly</a> until an extensive 2015 study. Only "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>" is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as <a href="diplodocinae">diplodocines</a>. "Brontosaurus" has long been considered a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Apatosaurus"; its only species was reclassified as "A.excelsus" in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that "Brontosaurus" is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from "Apatosaurus", but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, "Apatosaurus" would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>".

"Apatosaurus" was a large, long-necked, <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s were slightly shorter than its <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a>s. Most size estimates are based on specimen <a href="Carnegie%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">CM</a>3018, the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> of "A.louisae". In 1936 this was measured to be , by measuring the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>. Current estimates are similar, finding that the individual was long and had a mass of . A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of "<a href="Dreadnoughtus">Dreadnoughtus</a>", "Apatosaurus", and "<a href="Giraffatitan">Giraffatitan</a>" estimates CM3018 at , similar in mass to "Dreadnoughtus". Past estimates have put the creature's mass as high as . Some specimens of "A.ajax" (such as <a href="Oklahoma%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">OMNH</a>1670) represent individuals 1130% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM3018 or , potentially rivalling the largest <a href="titanosaur">titanosaur</a>s.
The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> diet. The snout of "Apatosaurus" and similar <a href="diplodocoidea">diplodocoids</a> is squared, with only "<a href="Nigersaurus">Nigersaurus</a>" having a squarer skull. The braincase of "Apatosaurus" is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of "Apatosaurus" have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.

Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of "A.louisae" is 15cervicals, 10<a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">dorsals</a>, 5<a href="Sacrum%23Other%20animals">sacrals</a>, and 82<a href="Vertebra%23Other%20animals">caudals</a>. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" are stouter and more robust than those of other <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a>s and were found to be most similar to "Camarasaurus" by <a href="Charles%20Whitney%20Gilmore">Charles Whitney Gilmore</a>. In addition, they support <a href="Cervical%20rib%23Other%20animals">cervical ribs</a> that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In "Apatosaurus louisae", the <a href="atlas%20%28anatomy%29">atlas</a>-<a href="axis%20%28anatomy%29">axis</a> complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. "Apatosaurus" has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. "Apatosaurus", like its close relative "<a href="Supersaurus">Supersaurus</a>", has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. "Apatosaurus" also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.
The limb bones are also very robust. Within <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a>, the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> of "Apatosaurus louisae" is intermediate in morphology between those of "A.ajax" and "Brontosaurus excelsus". The arm bones are stout, so the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> of "Apatosaurus" resembles that of "Camarasaurus", as well as "Brontosaurus". However, the humeri of "Brontosaurus" and "A.ajax" are more similar to each other than they are to "A.louisae". In 1936 <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a> noted that previous reconstructions of "Apatosaurus" forelimbs erroneously proposed that the <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> could cross; in life they would have remained parallel. "Apatosaurus" had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>". The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one. The single manual claw bone (<a href="ungual">ungual</a>) is slightly curved and squarely <a href="%3Awikt%3Atruncated">truncated</a> on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust <a href="ilium%20bone">ilia</a>, and the fused (co-ossified) <a href="pubic%20bone">pubes</a> and <a href="ischium">ischia</a>. The femora of "Apatosaurus" are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of "Diplodocus" but are nearly indistinguishable from those of "Camarasaurus". The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of "Apatosaurus" has three claws on the innermost digits; the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. The first metatarsal is the stoutest, a feature shared among diplodocids.

The name "Apatosaurus ajax" was coined in 1877 by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, Professor of <a href="Paleontology">Paleontology</a> at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, based on a nearly complete skeleton (holotype, <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">YPM</a>1860) discovered in the eastern foothills of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in <a href="Gunnison%20County%2C%20Colorado">Gunnison County, Colorado</a>. The composite term "Apatosaurus" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "apatē" ()/"apatēlos" () meaning "deception"/"deceptive", and "sauros" () meaning "lizard"; thus, "deceptive lizard". Marsh gave it this name based on the <a href="chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevron</a> bones, which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs; instead, the chevron bones of "Apatosaurus" showed similarities with those of <a href="mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s. During excavation and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another "Apatosaurus" individual originally described as "Atlantosaurus immanis"; as a consequence, some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence. Marsh distinguished the new genus "Apatosaurus" from "<a href="Atlantosaurus">Atlantosaurus</a>" on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae, with "Apatosaurus" possessing three and "Atlantosaurus" four. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at <a href="Como%20Bluff">Como Bluff</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. He gave this specimen a new name based on the conventions of his age and the relatively sparse fossil record available at that time. It was later recognised that the features he had used to distinguish genera and species were in fact more widespread among sauropods. He named the new species "Brontosaurus excelsus". All specimens currently considered "Apatosaurus" were from the Morrison Formation, the location of the excavations of Marsh and his rival <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>.
Another specimen, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, which is occasionally assigned to "Apatosaurus", is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted. The specimen was found north of <a href="Medicine%20Bow%2C%20Wyoming">Medicine Bow, Wyoming</a>, in 1898 by <a href="Walter%20W.%20Granger">Walter Granger</a>, and took the entire summer to extract. To complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of "Diplodocus"which was later found to be more accuratebut was based on "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries". These skulls were likely those of "Camarasaurus", the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find "Apatosaurus" skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was "largely conjectural and based on that of "Morosaurus"" (now "Camarasaurus").

In 1903 <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer Riggs</a> published a study that described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the <a href="Grand%20Valley%20%28Colorado-Utah%29">Grand River Valley</a> near <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita, Colorado</a>, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described "Brontosaurus". Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both "Brontosaurus" and "Apatosaurus ajax", Riggs realized that the holotype of "A.ajax" was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since "Apatosaurus" was the earlier name, "Brontosaurus" should be considered a junior synonym of "Apatosaurus". Because of this, Riggs recombined "Brontosaurus excelsus" as "Apatosaurus excelsus". Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to "Apatosaurus", Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to "A.excelsus".

Despite Riggs' publication, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>, who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the "Apatosaurus" mount of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> "Brontosaurus". Because of this decision the name "Brontosaurus" was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered "Apatosaurus", and the museum's popularity meant that "Brontosaurus" became one of the best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.

It was not until 1909 that an "Apatosaurus" skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at <a href="Dinosaur%20National%20Monument">Dinosaur National Monument</a>. The skull was found a short distance from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species "Apatosaurus louisae", named after <a href="Louise%20Whitfield%20Carnegie">Louise Carnegie</a>, wife of <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of "Diplodocus". Another smaller skeleton of "A.louisae" was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the "Apatosaurus" specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a "Camarasaurus" skull on the mount.

While most other museums were using cast or sculpted "Camarasaurus" skulls on "Apatosaurus" mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a "Camarasaurus", with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 illustration of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.

No "Apatosaurus" skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of "Diplodocus" and "Apatosaurus". They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that "Apatosaurus" had a "Diplodocus"-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to "Diplodocus" might instead be those of "Apatosaurus". They reassigned multiple skulls to "Apatosaurus" based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that "Apatosaurus" might have possessed a "Camarasaurus"-like skull, based on a disarticulated "Camarasaurus"-like tooth found at the precise site where an "Apatosaurus" specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of "Apatosaurus" was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>". In 2011 the first specimen of "Apatosaurus" where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, <a href="Cincinnati%20Museum%20Center">CMC</a>VP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from "A.louisae", but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with "A.ajax". Another well-preserved skull is <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>.

Almost all modern paleontologists agreed with Riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a> (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name "Apatosaurus", having been published first, has priority as the official name; "Brontosaurus" was considered a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologist<a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>argued in the 1990s that "A.ajax" and "A.excelsus" were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.

In 2015 Emanuel Tschopp, <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Mateus">Octávio Mateus</a>, and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that "A.ajax" and "A.louisae" differ in twelve characters, and "Diplodocus carnegiei" and "D.hallorum" differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in "D.carnegiei" and "A.louisae", but five differing features in "B.excelsus". Therefore, Tschopp etal. argued that "Apatosaurus excelsus", originally classified as "Brontosaurus excelsus", had enough morphological differences from other species of "Apatosaurus" that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of "Apatosaurus" species compared to "B.excelsus". Other species previously assigned to "Apatosaurus", such as "Elosaurus parvus" and "Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin" were also reclassified as "Brontosaurus". Some features proposed to separate "Brontosaurus" from "Apatosaurus" include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the <a href="acromion">acromial edge</a> and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the <a href="Talus%20bone">astragalus</a> 0.55 or greater. Sauropod expert <a href="Michael%20Daniel%20D%27Emic">Michael Daniel D'Emic</a> pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name "Brontosaurus" again if newer analyses obtained different results. Mammal palaeontologist <a href="Donald%20Prothero">Donald Prothero</a> criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature, concluding that he would keep "Brontosaurus" in quotes and not treat the name as a valid genus.

Many species of "Apatosaurus" have been designated from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of "Apatosaurus". They found that "A.louisae" was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a <a href="polytomy">polytomy</a> of "A.ajax", "A.parvus", and "A.excelsus". Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of "Apatosaurus" slightly differently, and also supported separating "Brontosaurus" from "Apatosaurus".


The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below is the result of an analysis by Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). The authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus.


"Apatosaurus" is a member of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Diplodocidae">Diplodocidae</a>, a <a href="cladistics">clade</a> of gigantic <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", "Supersaurus", and "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>". "Apatosaurus" is sometimes classified in the subfamily <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a>, which may also include "<a href="Suuwassea">Suuwassea</a>", "Supersaurus", and "Brontosaurus". <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> described "Apatosaurus" as allied to "Atlantosaurus" within the now-defunct group <a href="Atlantosauridae">Atlantosauridae</a>. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including "Apatosaurus", "Atlantosaurus", "Morosaurus" (="Camarasaurus") and "Diplodocus". He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer S. Riggs</a> said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped "Apatosaurus" within <a href="Opisthocoelia">Opisthocoelia</a>. Sauropoda is still used as the group name. In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed "Apatosaurus" a more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> diplodocid, sometimes less basal than "Supersaurus".

<a href="Cladogram">Cladogram</a> of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015).

It was believed throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like "Apatosaurus" were too massive to support their own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square <a href="snout">snout</a>, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of "Apatosaurus" suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>. It may have eaten <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="cycadeoid">cycadeoid</a>s, <a href="seed%20fern">seed fern</a>s, <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s, and <a href="algae">algae</a>. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.

A 2015 study of the necks of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" were used for <a href="intraspecific%20combat">intraspecific combat</a>. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.

Trackways of sauropods like "Apatosaurus" show that they may have had a range of around per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of per hour. The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling, or to recoil after strides. A trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism, though this is disputed.

Diplodocids like "Apatosaurus" are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like "Apatosaurus" were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.

Other studies by Taylor find that all <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. "Apatosaurus", like "Diplodocus", would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state "Apatosaurus" had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet.

Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like "Diplodocus" were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of "Apatosaurus" and "Diplodocus". He found that the neck of "Apatosaurus" was very flexible.

Given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like "Apatosaurus", physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed. Beginning with the assumption that, like <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns, "Apatosaurus" did not have a <a href="thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, the <a href="dead%20space%20%28physiology%29">dead-space volume</a> (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about for a specimen. Paladino calculates its <a href="lung%20volumes">tidal volume</a> (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at with an avian respiratory system, if mammalian, and if reptilian.

On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been <a href="parabronchi">parabronchi</a>, with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in <a href="avian%20lungs">avian lungs</a>, and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of "Apatosaurus" has been estimated at , allowing for a , four-chambered heart and a lung capacity. That would allow about for the necessary tissue. Evidence for the avian system in "Apatosaurus" and other sauropods is also present in the <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumaticity</a> of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.

James Spotila et al. (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.

James Farlow (1987) calculates that an "Apatosaurus"-sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents. Assuming "Apatosaurus" had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino etal. (1997) estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day.

A 1999 microscopic study of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10years. In 2008, a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, "Apatosaurus" would have grown to 25t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15years, with growth peaking at in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found "Apatosaurus" grew per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70years old. These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling. One of the first identified growth factors of "Apatosaurus" was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature's maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936.

Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler etal. (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded the "Apatosaurus" sp.SMA0014 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 21years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated "Apatosaurus" sp.BYU 601–17328 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 19years, and died aged 31.

Compared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from "Apatosaurus". Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of "Apatosaurus"; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish "Apatosaurus" from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.

An article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of "Apatosaurus" tails by <a href="Nathan%20Myhrvold">Nathan Myhrvold</a> and paleontologist <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a>. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like "Apatosaurus" was a very long, tapering structure resembling a <a href="bullwhip">bullwhip</a>. This computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.

A pathology has been identified on the tail of "Apatosaurus", caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>" and <a href="mamenchisaurid">mamenchisaurid</a>s, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.

The <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>, dates from between 156.3<a href="Year%23Abbreviations%20yr%20and%20ya">mya</a> at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late <a href="Oxfordian%20stage">Oxfordian</a>, <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a>, and early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> <a href="faunal%20stages">stages</a> of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a> environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the <a href="Front%20Range">Front Range</a> of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a> in Portugal and the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru Formation</a> in Tanzania.
"Apatosaurus" was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after "Camarasaurus". "Apatosaurus" may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of "Apatosaurus ajax" are known exclusively from the upper <a href="Brushy%20Basin%20Member">Brushy Basin Member</a>, about 152–151 mya. "A.louisae" fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional "Apatosaurus" remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to "Brontosaurus".

The Morrison Formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "<a href="Saurophaganax">Saurophaganax</a>", and "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>"; the sauropods "Brontosaurus", "Brachiosaurus", "Camarasaurus", and "Diplodocus"; and the <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Apatosaurus" is commonly found at the same sites as "Allosaurus", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", and "Stegosaurus". "Allosaurus" accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a>mainly "Allosaurus", "Ceratosaurus", and "Torvosaurus"or have a close counterpart"Brachiosaurus" and "<a href="Lusotitan">Lusotitan</a>", "Camptosaurus" and "<a href="Draconyx">Draconyx</a>", and "Apatosaurus" and "<a href="Dinheirosaurus">Dinheirosaurus</a>". Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include <a href="actinopterygii">ray-finned fishes</a>, frogs, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s, turtles, <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodonts</a>, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorpha</a>ns, and several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>. Shells of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, <a href="equisetum">horsetails</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>es, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s with fern <a href="understory">understory</a> (<a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s), to fern <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s with occasional trees such as the "<a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>"-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

Albertosaurus

Albertosaurus (; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s that lived in western North America during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 70 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, "A. sarcophagus", was apparently restricted in <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> to the modern-day <a href="Canadian%20province">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing "<a href="Gorgosaurus%20libratus">Gorgosaurus libratus</a>" as a second species. 

As a tyrannosaurid, "Albertosaurus" was a <a href="biped">biped</a>al <a href="predator">predator</a> with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> in its local <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. While "Albertosaurus" was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative "Tyrannosaurus rex", growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than 2 metric tons.

Since the first discovery in 1884, <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of "Albertosaurus" anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of <a href="pack%20hunter">pack</a> behaviour and allows studies of <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> and <a href="population%20biology">population biology</a>, which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.

"Albertosaurus" was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>" and "Tyrannosaurus". Typical "Albertosaurus" adults measured up to long, while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over long. Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult "Albertosaurus" weighed between 1.3 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s and 1.7 tonnes (1.9 tons).

"Albertosaurus" shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids. Typically for a theropod, "Albertosaurus" was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and <a href="torso">torso</a> with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>, was short and did not reach the ground. The third digit was longer than the rest. "Albertosaurus" may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21 km/hour (8−13 mi/hour). At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.

Two skin impressions from "Albertosaurus" are known, both showing <a href="Scale%20%28anatomy%29">scales</a>. One patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long, unknown bone, indicating that the patch is from the belly. The scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape. Also preserved are two larger feature scales, placed 4,5 cm apart from each other. Another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body. These scales are small, diamond-shaped and arranged in rows.

The massive <a href="skull">skull</a> of "Albertosaurus", which was perched on a short, S-shaped neck, was about long in the largest adults. Wide openings in the skull (<a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a>) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for <a href="muscle">muscle</a> attachment and <a href="sensory%20organ">sensory organ</a>s. Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>" at least 62. Unlike most theropods, "Albertosaurus" and other tyrannosaurids were <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a>, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry teeth at the tip of the upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in <a href="cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross section</a>. Like with "Tyrannosaurus", the maxillary (cheek) teeth of "Albertosaurus" were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of "Albertosaurus" was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.

<a href="William%20Abler">William Abler</a> observed in 2001 that "Albertosaurus" <a href="tooth%20serrations">tooth serrations</a> resemble a <a href="Fracture">crack</a> in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" to wood they work. The use of a <a href="drill">drill</a> to create an "ampulla" of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called "kerfs" and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like <a href="phytosaur">phytosaur</a>s and "<a href="Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a>" had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.

"Albertosaurus" was named by <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of "Tyrannosaurus rex". The name honours <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, the <a href="Canadian%20province">Canadian province</a> established the same year, in which the first remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> term "σαυρος"/"sauros" ("lizard"), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> is "Albertosaurus sarcophagus"; the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is derived from Ancient Greek σαρκοφάγος ("sarkophagos") meaning "flesh-eating" and having the same <a href="etymology">etymology</a> as the <a href="sarcophagus">funeral container</a> with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words σαρξ/"sarx" ("flesh") and φαγειν/"phagein" ("to eat"). More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science.

The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a> of the <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a> alongside the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a>, in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a>, led by the famous <a href="geologist">geologist</a> <a href="Joseph%20Tyrrell">Joseph Burr Tyrrell</a>. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague <a href="Thomas%20Chesmer%20Weston">Thomas Chesmer Weston</a> found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species "Laelaps incrassatus" by <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> in 1892, although the name "Laelaps" was <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">preoccupied</a> by a genus of <a href="mite">mite</a> and had been changed to "<a href="Dryptosaurus">Dryptosaurus</a>" in 1877 by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However, <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> used the name "Dryptosaurus incrassatus" instead of "Laelaps incrassatus" when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904, a combination first coined by <a href="Oliver%20Perry%20Hay">Oliver Perry Hay</a> in 1902. Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that "D. incrassatus" was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of "D. aquilunguis", type species of "Dryptosaurus", so Osborn created the new name "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before. Both specimens (the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> CMN 5600 and the <a href="paratype">paratype</a> CMN 5601) are stored in the <a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">Canadian Museum of Nature</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, "Albertosaurus" might be a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>", a "dubious name" that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010, <a href="Thomas%20Carr%20%28paleontologist%29">Thomas Carr</a> established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphy</a>: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the <a href="palatine%20bone">palatine bone</a>, proving that "Albertosaurus" was a valid <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

On 11 August 1910, American paleontologist <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> discovered the remains of a large group of "Albertosaurus" at another <a href="quarry">quarry</a> alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the <a href="bonebed">bonebed</a>. Among the bones deposited in the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> collections in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> are seven sets of right <a href="metatarsal">metatarsal</a>s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. Palaeontologist <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Tyrrell%20Museum%20of%20Palaeontology">Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology</a> rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside <a href="Dry%20Island%20Buffalo%20Jump%20Provincial%20Park">Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park</a>. Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of 13 more individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over in length. None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums. Excavations continued until 2008, when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at 12, on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at 26 if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>. A total of 1,128 "Albertosaurus" bones had been secured, the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.

In 1911, Barnum Brown, during the second year of American Museum of Natural History operations in Alberta, uncovered a fragmentary partial "Albertosaurus" skull at the Red Deer River near Tolman Bridge, specimen AMNH 5222.

<a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a> described a new species in 1928, "Albertosaurus arctunguis", based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by Gus Lindblad and Ralph Hornell near the Red Deer River in 1923, but this species has been considered identical to "A. sarcophagus" since 1970. Parks' specimen (ROM 807) is housed in the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

Between 1926 and 1972, no "Albertosaurus" fossils were found at all; but, since the seventies, there has been a steady increase in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, but these probably do not represent "A. sarcophagus" and may not even belong to the genus "Albertosaurus".

In 1913, <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Hazelius%20Sternberg">Charles H. Sternberg</a> recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a> libratus" in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Finding, largely due to a lack of good "Albertosaurus" skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, <a href="Dale%20Russell">Dale Russell</a> declared the name "Gorgosaurus" a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Albertosaurus", which had been named first, and "G. libratus" was renamed "Albertosaurus libratus" in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus "Albertosaurus" backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.

In 2003, <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a>, benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are <a href="sister%20taxa">sister taxa</a>, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that "Albertosaurus" and "Gorgosaurus" be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than "Daspletosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus", which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and Currie suggested that the "Albertosaurus"-"Gorgosaurus" situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.

Apart from "A. sarcophagus", "A. arctunguis" and "A. libratus", several other species of "Albertosaurus" have been named. All of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as "nomina dubia", and are not assigned to "Albertosaurus".

In 1930, <a href="Anatoly%20Nikolaevich%20Riabinin">Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin</a> named "Albertosaurus pericolosus" based on a tooth from China, that probably belonged to "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>". In 1932, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> renamed "Dryptosaurus incrassatus", not considered a "nomen dubium" by him, to "Albertosaurus incrassatus". Because he had identified "Gorgosaurus" with "Albertosaurus", in 1970, Russell also renamed "Gorgosaurus sternbergi" (Matthew & Brown 1922) into "Albertosaurus sternbergi" and "Gorgosaurus lancensis" (Gilmore 1946) into "Albertosaurus lancensis". The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of "Gorgosaurus libratus", the latter as either identical to "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" or representing a separate genus "<a href="Nanotyrannus">Nanotyrannus</a>". In 1988, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> based "Albertosaurus megagracilis" on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> of Montana. It was renamed "<a href="Dinotyrannus">Dinotyrannus</a>" in 1995, but is now thought to represent a juvenile "Tyrannosaurus rex". Also in 1988, Paul renamed "<a href="Alectrosaurus">Alectrosaurus</a> olseni" (Gilmore 1933) into "Albertosaurus olseni"; this has found no general acceptance. In 1989, "Gorgosaurus novojilovi" (Maleev 1955) was renamed by <a href="Bryn%20Mader">Bryn Mader</a> and Robert Bradley as "Albertosaurus novojilovi"; today this is seen as a synonym of "Tarbosaurus".

On two occasions, species based on valid "Albertosaurus" material were reassigned to a different genus: in 1922 <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> renamed "A. sarcophagus" into "<a href="Deinodon">Deinodon</a> sarcophagus" and in 1939 German paleontologist <a href="Oskar%20Kuhn">Oskar Kuhn</a> renamed "A. arctunguis" into "Deinodon arctunguis".

"Albertosaurus" is a member of the theropod <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older "Gorgosaurus libratus" (sometimes called "Albertosaurus libratus"; see below). These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist. <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Holtz</a> found "<a href="Appalachiosaurus">Appalachiosaurus</a>" to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with other authors.

The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>", "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>" and "Tyrannosaurus". Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (<a href="tibia">tibia</a>) and feet (<a href="metatarsal">metatarsal</a>s and <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>).

Below is the cladogram of the Tyrannosauridae based on the <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> conducted by Loewen "et al." in 2013.

Most age categories of "Albertosaurus" are represented in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a>. Using bone <a href="histology">histology</a>, the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known "Albertosaurus" is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>) and measured slightly more than in length. The specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an "S"-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was per year, based on an adult 1.3 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to "Albertosaurus" had similar growth rates, although the much larger "Tyrannosaurus rex" grew at almost five times this rate ( per year) at its peak. The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> in "Albertosaurus", although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.

During growth, through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.

Most known "Albertosaurus" individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly <a href="preservation%20bias">preservation bias</a>, where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young "Albertosaurus" are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life history</a>, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile "Albertosaurus" are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.

A hypothesis of "Albertosaurus" life history postulates that <a href="hatchling">hatchling</a>s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult "Albertosaurus", and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of <a href="senescence">senescence</a>. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, <a href="African%20buffalo">African buffalo</a>, and <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all "Albertosaurus" specimens are known from one locality.

The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 "Albertosaurus", the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>" assemblage at the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a> in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.

The near-absence of <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a> remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the "Albertosaurus" bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="California">California</a>, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.

There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs, including <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>ns and <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a>s. However, only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site. Small theropods like "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>" and "<a href="Coelophysis">Coelophysis</a>" have been found in aggregations, as have larger predators like "Allosaurus" and "<a href="Mapusaurus">Mapusaurus</a>". There is some evidence of <a href="gregarious%20behaviour">gregarious behaviour</a> in other tyrannosaurids as well. Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside "<a href="Sue%20%28dinosaur%29">Sue</a>", the "Tyrannosaurus" mounted in the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and a bonebed in the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> of Montana contains at least three specimens of "Daspletosaurus", preserved alongside several hadrosaurs. These findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in "Albertosaurus", although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations. Others have speculated that instead of social groups, at least some of these finds represent <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>-like mobbing of carcasses, where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and <a href="cannibal">cannibal</a>ized.

Currie has also speculated on the pack-hunting habits of "Albertosaurus". The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of <a href="ornithomimid">ornithomimid</a>s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger "Albertosaurus" were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a>s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> smaller than adult "Albertosaurus" in mass. A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands. However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.

In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> dinosaurs such as "Albertosaurus" were caused by a parasite similar to "<a href="Trichomonas">Trichomonas</a> gallinae", which infects birds. They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.

In 2001, <a href="Bruce%20Rothschild">Bruce Rothschild</a> and others published a study examining evidence for <a href="stress%20fractures">stress fractures</a> and <a href="tendon%20avulsions">tendon avulsions</a> in <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. They found that only one of the 319 "Albertosaurus" foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did. The scientists found that stress fractures were "significantly" less common in "Albertosaurus" than in the <a href="carnosaur">carnosaur</a> "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". ROM 807, the holotype of "A. arctunguis" (now referred to "A. sarcophagus"), had a deep hole in the <a href="iliac%20blade">iliac blade</a>, although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological. The specimen also contains some <a href="exostosis">exostosis</a> on the fourth left metatarsal. In 1970, two of the five "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" specimens with humeri were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them.

In 2010, the health of the Dry Island "Albertosaurus" assembly was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called <a href="enthesophyte">enthesophyte</a>s, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a "<a href="Majungasaurus">Majungasaurus</a>" population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.

According to a scientific paper published in 2012, "Albertosaurus" could exert a bite force of around 42,000 newtons.

All identifiable fossils of "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" are known from the upper <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a> in Alberta. These younger units of this <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> date to the early <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> stage of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> Period, 70 to 68 <a href="Mega-annum">Ma</a> (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the <a href="Bearpaw%20Shale">Bearpaw Shale</a>, a <a href="Marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> formation representing a section of the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, <a href="estuary">estuaries</a> and <a href="tidal%20flat">tidal flat</a>s. Numerous <a href="coal">coal</a> seams represent ancient <a href="peat">peat</a> <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s. Like most of the other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fossils from the formation, "Albertosaurus" remains are found in deposits laid down in the <a href="river%20delta">deltas</a> and <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.

The <a href="fauna">fauna</a> of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. <a href="Shark">Shark</a>s, <a href="Batoidea">rays</a>, <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>s, <a href="bowfin">bowfin</a>s, <a href="gar">gar</a>s and the gar-like "<a href="Aspidorhynchus">Aspidorhynchus</a>" made up the fish fauna. Mammals included <a href="multituberculate">multituberculate</a>s and the <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> "<a href="Didelphodon">Didelphodon</a>". The saltwater <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a> "<a href="Leurospondylus">Leurospondylus</a>" has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, "<a href="Champsosaurus">Champsosaurus</a>", and <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns like "<a href="Leidyosuchus">Leidyosuchus</a>" and "<a href="Stangerochampsa">Stangerochampsa</a>". Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera "<a href="Edmontosaurus">Edmontosaurus</a>", "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>" and "<a href="Hypacrosaurus">Hypacrosaurus</a>". Ceratopsians and <a href="ornithomimid">ornithomimid</a>s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer <a href="ankylosauria">ankylosauria</a>ns and <a href="pachycephalosaur">pachycephalosaur</a>s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s, <a href="dromaeosaurid">dromaeosaurid</a>s, and <a href="caenagnathid">caenagnathid</a>s. Intermingled with the "Albertosaurus" remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod "<a href="Albertonykus">Albertonykus</a>" were found. Adult "Albertosaurus" were the <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.

Alfred Russel Wallace

Alfred Russel Wallace (8 January 18237 November 1913) was a British <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a>, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, and biologist. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> through <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>." Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the <a href="Amazon%20River%20basin">Amazon River basin</a> and then in the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a>, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a>, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>.

He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the "father of <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>". Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of <a href="Aposematism">warning colouration</a> in animals, and the <a href="Wallace%20effect">Wallace effect</a>, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to <a href="speciation">speciation</a> by encouraging the development of barriers against <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a>. Wallace's 1904 book "Man's Place in the Universe" was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the <a href="Planetary%20habitability">likelihood of life on other planets</a>. He was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.

Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a> and his belief in a <a href="Mind%E2%80%93body%20dualism">non-material origin</a> for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.

Aside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>", was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.

Wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.

Alfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of <a href="Llanbadoc">Llanbadoc</a>, near <a href="Usk">Usk</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>. He was the eighth of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. Mary Anne was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>, a leader of Scottish forces during the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> in the 13th century. Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a>, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended <a href="Richard%20Hale%20School">Hertford Grammar School</a> until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836, when he was aged 14.
Wallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice <a href="surveying">surveyor</a>. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the <a href="London%20Mechanics%20Institute">London Mechanics Institute</a>. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a> and of <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.

At the end of 1839, they moved to <a href="Kington%2C%20Herefordshire">Kington</a>, Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at <a href="Neath">Neath</a> in <a href="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a> in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales. By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, at the age of 20, left in January.

One result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.

After a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read "<a href="An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Principle%20of%20Population">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20Robert%20Malthus">Thomas Robert Malthus</a>, and one evening he met the entomologist <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a>. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal "Zoologist". He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the <a href="River%20Neath">Vale of Neath</a>.

Wallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath <a href="Mechanics%27%20Institute">Mechanics' Institute</a>, founded in 1843. William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).

During this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28publisher%2C%20born%201802%29">Robert Chambers</a>' anonymously published evolutionary treatise "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>", Charles Darwin's "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">The Voyage of the Beagle</a>", and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>'s "<a href="Principles%20of%20Geology">Principles of Geology</a>".

Inspired by the chronicles of earlier travelling naturalists, including <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, Charles Darwin and especially <a href="William%20Henry%20Edwards">William Henry Edwards</a>, Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the "Mischief". Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a> for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>.

Wallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near <a href="Bel%C3%A9m">Belém</a>, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist <a href="Richard%20Spruce">Richard Spruce</a>, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.

Wallace continued charting the <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a> for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna. On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig "Helen". After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.

Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig "Jordeson", which was sailing from Cuba to London. The "Jordeson"'s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.

After his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20%28Argentina%29">Rio Negro</a> until the Indian town of <a href="Jativa">Jativa</a> on <a href="Orinoco%20River">Orinoco River</a> basin and as far west as Micúru (<a href="Mit%C3%BA">Mitú</a>) on the <a href="Uaup%C3%A9s%20River">Uaupés River</a>. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaupés River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included "On the Monkeys of the Amazon") and two books; "Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses" and "Travels on the Amazon". He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists—most significantly, Darwin.

From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Museum%20of%20Zoology">Cambridge University Museum of Zoology</a>. Wallace had as many as a hundred assistants who collected on his behalf. Among these, his most trusted assistant was a Malay by the name of Ali who later called himself <a href="Ali%20Wallace%20%28naturalist%29">Ali Wallace</a>. While Wallace collected insects, many of the bird specimens were collected by his assistants including around 5000 collected and prepared by Ali. Wallace's observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the <a href="Wallace%20line">Wallace line</a>.

Wallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science. One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog "<a href="Rhacophorus%20nigropalmatus">Rhacophorus nigropalmatus</a>", known as Wallace's <a href="flying%20frog">flying frog</a>. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.

Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>", which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>, who called it his "favorite bedside companion" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially "<a href="Lord%20Jim">Lord Jim</a>".

In 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society of London</a>. Later that year, he visited Darwin at <a href="Down%20House">Down House</a>, and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>. During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>, <a href="warning%20colouration">warning colouration</a>, and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species. In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.

After a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement. In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, <a href="William%20Mitten">William Mitten</a>, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built <a href="The%20Dell%20%28Thurrock%29">the Dell</a>, a house of concrete, on land he leased in <a href="Grays">Grays</a> in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874), Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).

In the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>".

Despite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.

In 1876, Wallace needed a £500 advance from the publisher of "The Geographical Distribution of Animals" to avoid having to sell some of his personal property. Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.

<a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in "The Malay Archipelago". Mill asked him to join the general committee of his <a href="Land%20Tenure%20Reform%20Association">Land Tenure Reform Association</a>, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.

In 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, "Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims", on the subject. He criticised the UK's <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people. In 1889, Wallace read "<a href="Looking%20Backward">Looking Backward</a>" by <a href="Edward%20Bellamy">Edward Bellamy</a> and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor. After reading "<a href="Progress%20and%20Poverty">Progress and Poverty</a>", the best selling book by the progressive land reformist <a href="Henry%20George">Henry George</a>, Wallace described it as "Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century."

Wallace opposed <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit. In the 1890 article "Human Selection" he wrote, "Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent ..." In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a <a href="Fiat%20money">pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold</a>, which impressed the economist <a href="Irving%20Fisher">Irving Fisher</a> so much that he dedicated his 1920 book "Stabilizing the Dollar" to Wallace.

Wallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of <a href="militarism">militarism</a>. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the <a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a> in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea "...that this new horror is "inevitable," and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships."

In 1898, Wallace published a book entitled "The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures" about developments in the 19th century. The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism. Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book "The Revolt of Democracy" just weeks before his death.

Wallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published "Island Life" as a sequel to "The Geographic Distribution of Animals". In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>, spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist <a href="Alice%20Eastwood">Alice Eastwood</a> as his guide, exploring the flora of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper "English and American Flowers". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>" used information he collected on his American trip, and information he had compiled for the lectures.

On 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier. He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called him "the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century." Another commentator in the same edition said "No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'."

Some of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at <a href="Broadstone%2C%20Dorset">Broadstone, Dorset</a>. Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.

Unlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>. The concept had been advocated by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a>, <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Edmond%20Grant">Robert Grant</a>, among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a>, even revolutionary connotations.

Prominent anatomists and geologists such as <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, <a href="Adam%20Sedgwick">Adam Sedgwick</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> attacked it vigorously. It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.

He was also profoundly influenced by <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>' work, "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>", a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845:

In 1847, he wrote to Bates:
Wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories. During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers—such as the Amazon and its major tributaries—often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper "On the Monkeys of the Amazon". Near the end of the paper he asks the question, "Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?"

In February 1855, while working in <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> on the island of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, Wallace wrote "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", a paper which was published in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Natural%20History">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</a>" in September 1855. In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>. His conclusion that "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species" has come to be known as the "Sarawak Law". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.

The paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did <a href="Edward%20Blyth">Edward Blyth</a> who thought it "Good! Upon the whole! ... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into "species"." Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the <a href="progressive%20creationism">progressive creationism</a> of the time and wrote that it was "nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him." Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a "species sketch" of his continuing work in May 1856.

By February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago of the reality of evolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:

According to his autobiography, it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about <a href="Thomas%20Robert%20Malthus">Thomas Robert Malthus</a>'s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of <a href="Ternate">Ternate</a> at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of <a href="Halmahera">Gilolo</a>. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman <a href="Maarten%20Dirk%20van%20Renesse%20van%20Duivenbode">Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode</a>. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.

Wallace describes how he discovered natural selection as follows:

Wallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper "On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that "without speculation there is no good and original observation" while commenting that "I believe I go much further than you". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, "<a href="On%20the%20Tendency%20of%20Species%20to%20form%20Varieties%3B%20and%20on%20the%20Perpetuation%20of%20Varieties%20and%20Species%20by%20Natural%20Means%20of%20Selection">On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type</a>", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> if he thought it worthwhile. Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term "natural selection", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying "he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal." Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> in 1857.

Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.

Over the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.

After the publication of Darwin's "On the Origin of Species", Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper "Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species" in order to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the "Origin" on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.

An even lengthier defence of Darwin's work was "Creation by Law", a review Wallace wrote in 1867 for the "<a href="Quarterly%20Journal%20of%20Science">Quarterly Journal of Science</a>" of the book "The Reign of Law", which had been written by <a href="George%20Campbell%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">George Campbell</a>, the 8th Duke of Argyll, as a refutation of natural selection. After an 1870 meeting of the <a href="British%20Science%20Association">British Science Association</a>, Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were "no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have."

Historians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably <a href="Peter%20J.%20Bowler">Peter J. Bowler</a>, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather <a href="group%20selection">group selection</a>. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.

Others have noted that another difference was that Wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment. They point to a largely overlooked passage of Wallace's famous 1858 paper:

The <a href="cybernetics">cybernetician</a> and anthropologist <a href="Gregory%20Bateson">Gregory Bateson</a> would observe in the 1970s that, though writing it only as an example, Wallace had "probably said the most powerful thing that'd been said in the 19th Century". Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book "Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity", and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and <a href="systems%20theory">systems theory</a>.

In 1867, Darwin wrote to Wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes. Darwin had come to believe that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>, an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a> had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by <a href="John%20Jenner%20Weir">John Jenner Weir</a> that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. "Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic. In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea. <a href="Aposematism">Warning coloration</a> was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of <a href="Colours%20of%20animals">animal coloration</a> in general and the concept of protective coloration in particular. It was also part of a lifelong disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection. In his 1878 book "Tropical Nature and Other Essays", he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection. He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book "Darwinism". In 1890, he wrote a critical review in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" of his friend <a href="Edward%20Bagnall%20Poulton">Edward Bagnall Poulton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Colours%20of%20Animals">The Colours of Animals</a>" which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the "aesthetic preferences of the insect world".

In 1889, Wallace wrote the book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>", which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the <a href="Wallace%20effect">Wallace effect</a>, later referred to as <a href="Reinforcement%20%28speciation%29">reinforcement</a>. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.

In 1864, Wallace published a paper, "The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'", applying the theory to humankind. Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although <a href="Thomas%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> had in "<a href="Evidence%20as%20to%20Man%27s%20Place%20in%20Nature">Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</a>". He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not "regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape". He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the "recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that ... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded." For this paper he won Darwin's praise.

Shortly afterwards, Wallace became a <a href="spiritualism">spiritualist</a>. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the <a href="wikt%3Araison%20d%27%C3%AAtre">raison d'être</a> of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science <a href="Michael%20Shermer">Michael Shermer</a> has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not <a href="teleological">teleological</a> (purpose driven) and that it was not <a href="anthropocentric">anthropocentric</a> (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled "The World of Life", which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.

In many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's "<a href="Descent%20of%20Man">Descent of Man</a>", occasionally in strong disagreement.

Both Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose ("teleology") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:

Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles. In 1889, Wallace published the book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>" as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection. Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.

In 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a>, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the <a href="ecozone">zoogeographic regions</a> still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">connecting North America and South America</a>) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, "The Geographical Distribution of Animals", was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on <a href="zoogeography">zoogeography</a> for the next 80 years.

In this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that <a href="tapirs">tapirs</a> had originated in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia. Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">mass extinction of megafauna</a> in the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. In "The Geographical Distribution of Animals" (1876) he wrote, "We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared". He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, but by the time he wrote "World of Life" (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were "due to man's agency".

In 1880, Wallace published the book "Island Life" as a sequel to "The Geographical Distribution of Animals". It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the <a href="Galapagos">Galapagos</a> and <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>s. "Island Life" was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.

Wallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In "Tropical Nature and Other Essays" (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (<a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion. In "Island Life", Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, he wrote:

Wallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In "The World of Life" (1911) he wrote:

Wallace's 1904 book "Man's Place in the Universe" was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the <a href="planetary%20habitability">likelihood of life on other planets</a>. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the <a href="liquid%20phase">liquid phase</a>. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).

His treatment of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with a book "Is Mars Habitable?" to criticise the claims made by <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> that there were <a href="Martian%20canals">Martian canals</a> built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions. Among other things, Wallace pointed out that <a href="spectroscopic%20analysis">spectroscopic analysis</a> had shown no signs of <a href="water%20vapour">water vapour</a> in the <a href="Martian%20atmosphere">Martian atmosphere</a>, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible. Richard Milner comments: "It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace ... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals." Wallace originally became interested in the topic because his <a href="anthropocentric">anthropocentric</a> philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe.

Wallace also wrote poetic verse, an example being 'A Description Of Javita' from his book 'Travels on the Amazon'.

The poem begins:

'Tis where the streams divide, to swell the floods

Of the two mighty rivers of our globe;

Where gushing brooklets in their narrow beds'

It continues then to describe the people of the village and their lives in detail, although it is not an idyllic description:

There is an Indian village; all around,

The dark, eternal, boundless forest spreads

Its varied foliage. Stately palm-trees rise

On every side, and numerous trees unknown

Save by strange names uncouth to English ears.

Here I dwelt awhile the one white man

Among perhaps two hundred living souls.

They pass a peaceful and contented life'

The poem is a lyrical description of the life of a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a> in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between the lives of the people living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.

Wallace concludes:

I'd be an Indian here, and live content

To fish, and hunt, and paddle my canoe,

And see my children grow, like young wild fawns,

In health of body and in peace of mind,

Rich without wealth, and happy without gold !

The poem is referenced and partially recited in the BBC television series '<a href="The%20Ascent%20of%20Man">The Ascent of Man</a>'.

In a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:

Wallace was an enthusiast of <a href="phrenology">phrenology</a>. Early in his career, he experimented with <a href="hypnosis">hypnosis</a>, then known as <a href="mesmerism">mesmerism</a>. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success. When he began his experiments with mesmerism, the topic was very controversial and early experimenters, such as <a href="John%20Elliotson">John Elliotson</a>, had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment. Wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>. In 1893, he wrote:

Wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at <a href="s%C3%A9ance">séance</a>s, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.

Spiritualism appealed to many educated <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorians</a> who no longer found traditional religious doctrine, such as that of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a>, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists <a href="William%20Crookes">William Crookes</a> and <a href="Lord%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a>, the mathematician <a href="Augustus%20De%20Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a>, and the Scottish publisher <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>.

During the 1860s the stage magician <a href="John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne">John Nevil Maskelyne</a> exposed the trickery of the <a href="Davenport%20brothers">Davenport brothers</a>. Wallace was unable to accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods, and stated that Maskelyne possessed supernatural powers. However, in one of his writings Wallace dismissed Maskelyne, referring to a lecture exposing his tricks.

In 1874, Wallace visited the spirit photographer <a href="Frederick%20Hudson%20%28photographer%29">Frederick Hudson</a>. A photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced and Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring "even if he had by some means obtained possession of all the photographs ever taken of my mother, they would not have been of the slightest use to him in the manufacture of these pictures. I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with my mother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate." However, Hudson's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872.

Wallace's very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation. In 1875 Wallace published the evidence he believed proved his position in his book "On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism" which is a compilation of essays he wrote over a period of time. In his chapter entitled 'Modern Spiritualism: Evidence of Men of Science', Wallace refers to "three men of the highest eminence in their respective departments" who were Professor De Morgan, Professor Hare and Judge Edmonds who all investigated spiritualist phenomena. However, Wallace himself is only quoting their results and was not present at any of their investigations. His vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a>, and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Evidence of this can be seen in Wallace's letters dated 22 November and 1 December 1866, to Thomas Huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which Huxley, politely but emphatically, declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination. Others, such as the physiologist <a href="William%20Benjamin%20Carpenter">William Benjamin Carpenter</a> and zoologist <a href="E.%20Ray%20Lankester">E. Ray Lankester</a> became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace's work for the rest of his career. When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> responded:

Hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request.

In 1870, a <a href="Flat%20Earth">Flat-Earth</a> proponent named John Hampden offered a £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10 km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.

The judge for the wager, the editor of "Field" magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.

In the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a>. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a> was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.

Another factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.

In 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, "Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime", attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by "The Lancet", which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.

As a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s <a href="Royal%20Medal">Royal Medal</a> and <a href="Darwin%20Medal">Darwin Medal</a> in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.

He was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.

Recently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for "New Yorker" magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000. There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.
In a 2010 book, the environmentalist <a href="Tim%20Flannery">Tim Flannery</a> claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,' and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.

The <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, London, co-ordinated <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace%20centenary">commemorative events for the Wallace centenary</a> worldwide in the 'Wallace100' project in 2013. On 24 January, his portrait was unveiled in the Main Hall of the museum by <a href="Bill%20Bailey">Bill Bailey</a>, a fervent admirer. On the <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> programme "Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero", first broadcast on 21 April 2013, Bailey revealed how Wallace cracked evolution by revisiting places where Wallace discovered exotic species. Episode one featured <a href="orangutans">orangutans</a> and <a href="flying%20frog">flying frog</a>s in Bailey's journey through <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Episode two featured <a href="birds%20of%20paradise">birds of paradise</a>. On 7 November 2013, the 100th anniversary of Wallace's death, Sir <a href="David%20Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> unveiled a statue of Wallace at the museum. The statue was donated by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund, and was sculpted by <a href="Anthony%20Smith%20%28sculptor%29">Anthony Smith</a>. It depicts Wallace as a young man, collecting in the jungle. November 2013 also marked the debut of "The Animated Life of A. R. Wallace", a paper-puppet animation film dedicated to Wallace's centennial.


Wallace was a prolific author. In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>"). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology. An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.



A more comprehensive list of Wallace's publications that are available online, as well as a full bibliography of all of Wallace's writings, has been compiled by the historian <a href="Charles%20H.%20Smith%20%28historian%20of%20science%29">Charles H. Smith</a> at The Alfred Russel Wallace Page.

Alboin

Alboin (530sJune 28, 572) was king of the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> from about 560 until 572. During his reign the Lombards ended their <a href="migration%20period">migrations</a> by settling in Italy, the northern part of which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting effect on Italy and the <a href="Pannonian%20Basin">Pannonian Basin</a>; in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a> and his departure from <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> ended the dominance there of the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a>.

The period of Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia following the death of his father, <a href="Audoin">Audoin</a>, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping to take advantage of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>'s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29">Gothic War</a>.

After gathering a large coalition of peoples, Alboin crossed the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a> in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly took control of most of <a href="Venetia%20%28region%29">Venetia</a> and <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. <a href="Pavia">Pavia</a> offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.

Alboin was assassinated on June 28, 572, in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother, <a href="Helmichis">Helmichis</a>, with the support of Alboin's wife, <a href="Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29">Rosamund</a>, daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected <a href="Cleph">Cleph</a> as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.

The Lombards under King <a href="Wacho">Wacho</a> had migrated towards the east into Pannonia, taking advantage of the difficulties facing the <a href="Ostrogothic%20Kingdom">Ostrogothic Kingdom</a> in Italy following the death of its founder, <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric</a>, in 526. Wacho's death in about 540 brought his son <a href="Walthari">Walthari</a> to the throne, but, as the latter was still a minor, the kingdom was governed in his stead by Alboin's father, Audoin, of the <a href="Gausian%20dynasty">Gausian</a> clan. Seven years later Walthari died, giving Audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning <a href="Lethings">Lethings</a>.

Alboin was probably born in the 530s in Pannonia, the son of Audoin and his wife, <a href="Rodelinda%20%286th%20century%29">Rodelinda</a>. She may have been the niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a>. Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian. Alboin took as his first wife the Christian <a href="Chlothsind">Chlothsind</a>, daughter of the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> King <a href="Chlothar%20I">Chlothar</a>. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler <a href="Theudebald">Theudebald</a> in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option. However, the "<a href="Prosopography%20of%20the%20Later%20Roman%20Empire">Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire</a>" interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.

Alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asfeld">Battle of Asfeld</a> (552), he killed <a href="Turismod">Turismod</a>, son of the Gepid king <a href="Thurisind">Thurisind</a>, in a victory that resulted in the Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a>, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. <a href="Walter%20Goffart">Walter Goffart</a> believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical "<a href="Literary%20topos">topos</a>" of an <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a>.

Alboin came to the throne after the death of his father, sometime between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by <a href="Cunimund">Cunimund</a>, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian <a href="Menander%20Protector">Menander Protector</a> places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian <a href="Walter%20Pohl">Walter Pohl</a>.

An account of the war by the Byzantine <a href="Theophylact%20Simocatta">Theophylact Simocatta</a> sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, claiming it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter <a href="Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29">Rosamund</a>, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the "<a href="Origo%20Gentis%20Langobardorum">Origo Gentis Langobardorum</a>", where she was captured only after the death of her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor <a href="Justin%20II">Justin II</a> sent his son-in-law <a href="Baduarius">Baduarius</a> as "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.

Faced with the possibility of annihilation, Alboin made an alliance in 566 with the <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a> under <a href="Bayan%20I">Bayan I</a>, at the expense of some tough conditions: the Avars demanded a tenth of the Lombards' cattle, half of the war booty, and on the war's conclusion all of the lands held by the Gepids. The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.

In 567 the allies made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the northwest while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the <a href="Timi%C5%9F%20River">Tibiscus</a> and <a href="Danube%20River">Danube</a> rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the "Origo". The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars. Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids. The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.

Despite his success against the Gepids, Alboin had failed to greatly increase his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, even though there are indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called <a href="Plague%20of%20Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the <a href="Three-Chapter%20Controversy">Three-Chapter Controversy</a> sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, <a href="Narses">Narses</a>, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a>, <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a>, <a href="Thuringii">Thuringii</a>, <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>, <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King <a href="Sigebert%20I">Sigebert</a>, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.

The precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. <a href="Neil%20Christie">Neil Christie</a> considers 150,000 to be a realistic size, a number which would make the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of Italy. Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in "Die Langobarden" estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.

As a precautionary move Alboin strengthened his alliance with the Avars, signing what Paul calls a "foedus perpetuum" ("perpetual treaty") and what is referred to in the 9th-century "<a href="Historia%20Langobardorum%20codicis%20Gothani">Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani</a>" as a "pactum et foedus amicitiae" ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200 years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.

A further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as "<a href="foederati">foederati</a>", to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.

The Lombard migration started on Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision to combine the departure with a Christian celebration can be understood in the context of Alboin's recent conversion to <a href="Arianism">Arian Christianity</a>, as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly by political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing the migrants from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as "foederati". It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.

The season chosen for leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.

The road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the <a href="Ptuj">Poetovio</a> – <a href="Celje">Celeia</a> – <a href="Emona">Emona</a> – <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Forum Iulii</a> route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting <a href="Venetia%20%28region%29">Venetia</a>, but it was probably only in 569 that the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a> were crossed at the <a href="Vipava%20Valley">Vipava Valley</a>; the eyewitness <a href="Secundus%20of%20Non">Secundus of Non</a> gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.

The Lombards penetrated into Italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops ("<a href="Late%20Roman%20army%23Limitanei">milities limitanei</a>"). The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty, and the border forts may well have been left unmanned. What seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated. This agrees with Paul the Deacon's narrative, who speaks of a Lombard takeover in <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a> "without any hindrance".

The first town to fall into the Lombards' hands was <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Forum Iulii</a> (Cividale del Friuli), the seat of the local "magister militum". Alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Friuli">Duchy of Friuli</a> and made his nephew and <a href="shield%20bearer">shield bearer</a>, <a href="Gisulf%20I%20of%20Friuli">Gisulf</a>, <a href="Duke%20%28Lombard%29">duke</a> of the region, with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those "<a href="Fara%20%28Lombard%29">farae</a>", or clans, that he preferred.

Alboin's decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the "<a href="comes">comes</a> <a href="civitas">civitatis</a>" (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count ("comes") to duke ("dux") and from county ("comitatus") to duchy ("ducatus") also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.

From Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a>, the most important road junction in the northeast, and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the <a href="List%20of%20bishops%20and%20patriarchs%20of%20Aquileia">Patriarch of Aquileia</a> <a href="Paulinus%20I%20of%20Aquileia">Paulinus</a> fled with his clergy and flock to the island of <a href="Grado%2C%20Italy">Grado</a> in Byzantine-controlled territory.

From Aquileia, Alboin took the <a href="Via%20Postumia">Via Postumia</a> and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid succession <a href="Treviso">Tarvisium</a> (Treviso), <a href="Vicenza">Vicentia</a> (Vicenza), <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, <a href="Brescia">Brixia</a> (<a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>) and <a href="Bergamo">Bergomum</a> (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking <a href="Oderzo">Opitergium</a> (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the <a href="Via%20Annia">Via Annia</a>, such as <a href="Altinum">Altinum</a>, <a href="Padua">Patavium</a> (Padova), <a href="Monselice">Mons Silicis</a> (Monselice), <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a>. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as <a href="Torcello">Torcello</a> and <a href="Eraclea">Heraclia</a>.

Alboin moved west in his march, invading the region of <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a> (north-west Italy) and reaching its capital <a href="Mediolanum">Mediolanum</a> (<a href="Milan">Milan</a>) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the "<a href="vicarius">vicarius</a> Italiae" (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with the administration of the <a href="diocese%20of%20Annonarian%20Italy">diocese of Annonarian Italy</a>. Archbishop <a href="Honoratus%20of%20Mediolanum">Honoratus</a>, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the "vicarius Italiae" to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of <a href="Genoa">Genua</a> (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of "dominus Italiae" (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences in the northern part of the <a href="Po%20plain">Po plain</a>, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.

Several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It has been suggested that the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a vital part of the empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavs</a> in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanids</a> in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's policies eastward.

The impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive, especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562, when the last Gothic stronghold, Verona, was taken. Many men of means (Paul's "possessores") either lost their lives or their goods, but the exact extent of the despoliation of the Roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate. The clergy was also greatly affected. The Lombards were mostly pagans, and displayed little respect for the clergy and Church property. Many churchmen left their <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> to escape from the Lombards, like the two most senior bishops in the north, Honoratus and Paulinus. However, most of the <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s in the north sought an accommodation with the Lombards, as did in 569 the bishop of Tarvisium, Felix, when he journeyed to the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave river</a> to parley with Alboin, obtaining respect for the Church and its goods in return for this act of homage. It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years. The transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern Italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the "<a href="Schism%20of%20the%20Three%20Chapters">Three-Chapter Controversy</a>". In Lombard territory, churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution.

In the view of Pierre Riché, the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.

The first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of <a href="Ticinum">Ticinum</a> (<a href="Pavia">Pavia</a>), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance, sitting at the confluence of the rivers <a href="Po%20%28river%29">Po</a> and <a href="Ticino%20%28river%29">Ticino</a> and connected by waterways to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Italy">Praetorian prefecture of Italy</a>. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the <a href="Alpes%20Maritimae">Alpes Maritimae</a> and the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic coast</a>.

Careful to maintain the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as <a href="Aosta">Augusta Praetoria</a> (Aosta), <a href="Susa%20%28Italy%29">Segusio</a> (Susa), and the island of <a href="Comacina">Amacina</a> in the <a href="Lake%20Como">Larius Lucus</a> (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennines</a> and plundered <a href="Tuscia">Tuscia</a>, but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to <a href="Herwig%20Wolfram">Herwig Wolfram</a>, it was probably only in 578–579 that <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, although it was not completed by the time of his death.

Alboin's problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or "duces", who led each band ("fara") of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as "foederati" but as enemies of the Empire.

The king's disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of Frankish <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a> which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following <a href="Mummolus">Mummolus</a>' victory at <a href="Embrun%2C%20Hautes-Alpes">Embrun</a>. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by <a href="Guntram">Guntram</a> in about 571. Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of <a href="Austrasia">Austrasia</a>, <a href="Sigebert%20I">Sigebert I</a>. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as <a href="Christopher%20Wickham">Chris Wickham</a>.

The weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as very little is known of <a href="Faroald%20I%20of%20Spoleto">Faroald</a> and <a href="Zotto">Zotto</a>'s respective rises to power in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Spoleto">Spoletium</a> (<a href="Spoleto">Spoleto</a>) and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Benevento">Beneventum</a> (<a href="Benevento">Benevento</a>).

Ticinum eventually fell to the Lombards in either May or June 572. Alboin had in the meantime chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric. This choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the Gothic king.

It was in this palace that Alboin was killed on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most detailed narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by <a href="Marius%20Aventicensis">Marius of Aventicum</a> in his "Chronica", written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him, called <a href="Helmichis">Hilmegis</a> (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. <a href="Roger%20Collins">Roger Collins</a> describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.

Also contemporary is <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>' account presented in the "Historia Francorum", and echoed by the later <a href="Chronicle%20of%20Fredegar">Fredegar</a>. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the "Historia" and calls its account of Alboin's demise "a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity".

Elements present in Marius' account are echoed in Paul's "<a href="Historia%20Langobardorum">Historia Langobardorum</a>", which also contains distinctive features. One of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the <a href="skull%20cup">skull cup</a>. In Paul, the events that led to Alboin's downfall unfold in Verona. During a great feast, Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund to drink from his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin "invited her to drink merrily with her father". This reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.
The tale has been often dismissed as a fable and Paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king <a href="Ratchis">Ratchis</a>. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed to be part of a <a href="shamanism">shamanistic</a> ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.

The episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.

In her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and "<a href="spatharios">spatharius</a>" (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then recruited the king's "<a href="cubicularius">cubicularius</a>" (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on <a href="June%2028">June 28</a>, care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.

Peredeo's figure and role is mostly introduced by Paul; the "Origo" had for the first time mentioned his name as "Peritheus", but there his role had been different, as he was not the assassin, but the instigator of the assassination. In the vein of his reading of the skull cup, Goffart sees Peredeo not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character: he notes a similarity between Peredeo's name and the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> word "peritus", meaning "lost", a representation of those Lombards who entered into the service of the Empire.

Alboin's death had a lasting impact, as it deprived the Lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents the death of the last of the line of hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elbe to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and <a href="History%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian</a>s celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.

To complete the <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> and legitimize his claim to the throne, Helmichis married the queen, whose high standing arose not only from being the king's widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining Gepid nation, and as such her support was a guarantee of the Gepids' loyalty to Helmichis. The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona, where many may have opposed Alboin's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire. The Byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot. It was in their interest to stem the Lombard tide by bringing a pro-Byzantine regime into power in Verona, and possibly in the long run break the unity of the Lombards' kingdom, winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments.

The coup ultimately failed, as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke <a href="Cleph">Cleph</a> the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter <a href="Albsuinda">Albsuinda</a>. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

Cleph kept the throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a <a href="Slavery%20in%20medieval%20Europe">slave</a>. Possibly he too was killed at the instigation of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a <a href="Rule%20of%20the%20Dukes">decade of interregnum</a>, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of <a href="Authari">Authari</a>, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an <a href="exarchate%20of%20Ravenna">exarch</a> in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.

The consolidation of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had long-lasting consequences for Italy, as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian unification</a> in 1871.

Alboin, together with other tribal leaders is mentioned in the 10th century <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> poem called "<a href="Widsith">Widsith</a>" (lines 70-75) :
The historical period also formed the basis of the 1961 Italian adventure film "<a href="Sword%20of%20the%20Conqueror">Sword of the Conqueror</a>" (Italian: "Rosmunda e Alboino", German title "Alboin, König der Langobarden"), with <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> as Alboin.

There have been several artistic depictions of events from Alboin's life including <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>' "Alboin and Rosamunde" (1615); <a href="Charles%20Landseer">Charles Landseer</a>'s "Assassination of Alboin, King of the Lombards" (1856); and <a href="Fortunino%20Matania">Fortunino Matania</a>'s illustration "Rosamund captive before King Alboin of the Lombards" (1942).

Ealdred (archbishop of York)

Ealdred (or Aldred; died 11 September 1069) was <a href="Abbot%20of%20Tavistock">Abbot of Tavistock</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> in <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>. He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, he was appointed <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> of <a href="Tavistock%20Abbey">Tavistock Abbey</a> in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.

In 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so. As administrator of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a>, he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Llywelyn">Gruffydd ap Llywelyn</a>, a Welsh ruler.

In 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a> as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood.

Some sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a> as King of England. Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, Ealdred backed <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a> and then endorsed King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a> and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.

Ealdred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to <a href="Lyfing%20of%20Winchester">Lyfing</a>, his predecessor as bishop of Worcester. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became <a href="Abbot%20of%20Gloucester">Abbot of Gloucester</a>. Ealdred was a monk in the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> at <a href="Winchester%20Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043. Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death. No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.

Ealdred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in 1062. He may have acted as <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a>, or subordinate bishop, to his predecessor Lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric, as from about 1043 Ealdred witnessed as an "episcopus", or bishop, and a charter from 1045 or early 1046 names Sihtric as abbot of Tavistock. Lyfing died on 26 March 1046, and Ealdred became bishop of Worcester shortly after. However, Ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that Lyfing had held, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Crediton">Crediton</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Cornwall">Cornwall</a>; King Edward the Confessor (reigned 1043–1066) granted these to <a href="Leofric%20%28bishop%29">Leofric</a>, who combined the two sees at Crediton in 1050.

Ealdred was an advisor to King Edward the Confessor, and was often involved in the royal government. He was also a military leader, and in 1046 he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh. This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhydderch">Gruffydd ap Rhydderch</a>, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Rhydderch">Rhys ap Rhydderch</a>, and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh soldiers who were serving with the English, and Ealdred was defeated.

In 1050, Ealdred went to Rome "on the king's errand", apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat, or centre, of the bishopric of Crediton to Exeter. It may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage, if sources from after the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a> are to be believed. While in Rome, he attended a papal council, along with his fellow English bishop <a href="Herman%20%28bishop%29">Herman</a>. That same year, as Ealdred was returning to England he met <a href="Sweyn%20Godwinson">Sweyn</a>, a son of <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin, Earl of Wessex</a>, and probably absolved Sweyn for having abducted the abbess of <a href="Leominster%20Abbey">Leominster Abbey</a> in 1046. Through Ealdred's intercession, Sweyn was restored to his earldom, which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin <a href="Beorn%20Estrithson">Beorn Estrithson</a>. Ealdred helped Sweyn not only because Ealdred was a supporter of <a href="House%20of%20Godwin">Earl Godwin's family</a> but because Sweyn's earldom was close to his bishopric. As recently as 1049 Irish raiders had allied with Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwent">Gwent</a> in raiding along the <a href="River%20Usk">River Usk</a>. Ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders, but was again routed by the Welsh. This failure underscored Ealdred's need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids. Normally, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Hereford">bishop of Hereford</a> would have led the defence in the absence of an Earl of Hereford, but in 1049 the incumbent, <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Hereford%29">Æthelstan</a>, was blind, so Ealdred took on the role of defender.

Earl Godwin's rebellion against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was a supporter of the earl and his family. Ealdred was present at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family. Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept Harold Godwinson and his brothers as they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred "could not, or would not" capture the brothers. The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of <a href="%C3%86lfric%20Puttoc">Ælfric Puttoc</a>, the Archbishop of York. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held in <a href="Benefice">plurality</a>, or at the same time. Ealdred probably wanted to become Archbishop of York after Ælfric's death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing <a href="Cynesige">Cynesige</a>, a royal chaplain, instead. In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power. By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour. At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.

In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany to obtain Emperor <a href="Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry III</a>'s help in returning <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, son of <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a>, to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King <a href="Andrew%20I%20of%20Hungary">Andrew I</a>, having left England as an infant after his father's death and the accession of <a href="Canute%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with <a href="Herman%20II%20%28Archbishop%20of%20Cologne%29">Hermann II</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Cologne">Archbishop of Cologne</a>. He also was impressed with the buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions. The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help Ealdred. Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court. Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a>, this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.

Ealdred had returned to England by 1055, and brought with him a copy of the "<a href="Pontificale%20Romano-Germanicum">Pontificale Romano-Germanicum</a>", a <a href="Roman%20Pontifical">set of liturgies</a>, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript <a href="Cotton%20library">Cotton Vitellus E xii</a>, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the "<a href="Chrodegang%20of%20Metz">Rule of Chrodegang</a>", a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">secular canons</a>, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.

After Ealdred's return to England he took charge of the sees of Hereford and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ramsbury%20%28ancient%29">Ramsbury</a>. Ealdred also administered <a href="Winchcombe%20Abbey">Winchcombe Abbey</a> and <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester Abbey</a>. The authors of the "Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition" say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060, but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant, or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.

Ealdred became involved with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop <a href="Herman%20%28bishop%29">Herman</a> got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a>. Herman wished to move the seat of his see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close associate of Herman's, and the historian <a href="H.%20R.%20Loyn">H. R. Loyn</a> called Herman "something of an alter ego" to Ealdred. According to the medieval chronicler <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>, Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration of Ramsbury.

The king again employed Ealdred as a diplomat in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric in negotiations with the Welsh. Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop <a href="Leofgar%20of%20Hereford">Leofgar of Hereford</a>, who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace. Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward, but the oath may not have had any obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court. Ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York. The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights. Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.

In 1058 Ealdred made a pilgrimage to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the first English bishop to make the journey. He travelled through Hungary, and the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" stated that "he went to Jerusalem in such state as no-one had done before him". While in Jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the <a href="church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>. It is possible that the reason Ealdred travelled through Hungary was to arrange the travel of Edward the Exile's family to England. Another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to King Edward in Hungary. It is not known exactly when Edward the Exile's family returned to England, whether they returned with Edward in 1057, or sometime later, so it is only a possibility that they returned with Ealdred in 1058.

Very little documentary evidence is available from Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in "<a href="Hemming%27s%20Cartulary">Hemming's Cartulary</a>" as copies only. How the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">diocese of Worcester</a> was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a>, the prior of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the "<a href="Chronicon%20Abbatiae%20de%20Evesham">Evesham Chronicle</a>" states that <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a>, who became abbot of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a> in 1058, administered Worcester before he became abbot.

Cynesige, the archbishop of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, and it appears that Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself.

In 1061 Ealdred travelled to Rome to receive the <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Journeying with him was <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig</a>, another son of Earl Godwin, who was now earl of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred, by "amusing the simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors, had acquired, more by bribery than by reason, the archbishopric of York while still holding his former see." On his arrival in Rome, however, charges of <a href="simony">simony</a>, or the buying of ecclesiastical office, and lack of learning were brought against him, and his elevation to York was refused by <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20II">Pope Nicholas II</a>, who also deposed him from Worcester. The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the "Vita Edwardi", a life of Edward the Confessor, but the "Vita Wulfstani", an account of the life of Ealdred's successor at Worcester, <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a>, says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred. Yet another chronicler, John of Worcester, mentions nothing of any trouble in Rome, and when discussing the appointment of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people. John of Worcester also claims that at Wulfstan's consecration, <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the archbishop of Canterbury extracted a promise from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the Canterbury–York supremacy struggle, the story of Ealdred renouncing any claims to Worcester needs to be considered suspect.

For whatever reason, Ealdred gave up the see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates arrived in England to hold a council and make sure that Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This happened at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed <a href="Urse%20d%27Abetot">Urse d'Abetot</a>'s attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.

While archbishop, Ealdred built at <a href="Beverley">Beverley</a>, expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor Cynesige, as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese. He also built refectories for the canons at York and Southwell. He also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during Edward the Confessor's reign, attempting to discipline and reform the clergy. He held a synod of his clergy shortly before 1066.

John of Worcester, a medieval chronicler, stated that Ealdred crowned King Harold II in 1066, although the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> chroniclers mention Stigand as the officiating prelate. Given Ealdred's known support of Godwin's family, John of Worcester is probably correct. Stigand's position as archbishop was canonically suspect, and as earl Harold had not allowed Stigand to consecrate one of the earl's churches, it is unlikely that Harold would have allowed Stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation. Arguments for Stigand having performed the coronation, however, rely on the fact that no other English source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony; all Norman sources name Stigand as the presider. In all events, Ealdred and Harold were close, and Ealdred supported Harold's bid to become king. Ealdred perhaps accompanied Harold when the new king went to York and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after Harold's consecration.

According to the medieval chronicler <a href="Geoffrey%20Gaimar">Geoffrey Gaimar</a>, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a> Harold entrusted the loot gained from <a href="Harald%20III%20of%20Norway">Harold Hardrada</a> to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did this because he had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a>. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what to do while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.

Ealdred crowned William king on <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a> 1066. An innovation in William's coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning, Ealdred asked the assembled crowd, in English, if it was their wish that William be crowned king. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Coutances">Bishop of Coutances</a> then did the same, but in <a href="Norman%20language">Norman French</a>. In March 1067, William took Ealdred with him when William returned to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, along with the other English leaders Earl <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin of Mercia</a>, Earl <a href="Morcar">Morcar</a>, Edgar the Ætheling, and Archbishop Stigand. Ealdred at <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> 1068 performed the coronation of <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda</a>, William's wife. The "<a href="Laudes%20Regiae">Laudes Regiae</a>", or song commending a ruler, that was performed at Matilda's coronation may have been composed by Ealdred himself for the occasion. In 1069, when the northern <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s rebelled against William and attempted to install Edgar the Ætheling as king, Ealdred continued to support William. He was the only northern leader to support William, however. Ealdred was back at York by 1069; he died there on 11 September 1069, and was buried in his episcopal cathedral. He may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in 1068 and 1069. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of Worcester, Urse d'Abetot, encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a>, Ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him, saying "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse."

After Ealdred's death, one of the restraints on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred was one of a few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1087, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.

Ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority, and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese. He built the monastic church of St Peter at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> (now <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a>, though nothing of his fabric remains), then part of his diocese of Worcester. He also repaired a large part of <a href="Beverley%20Minster">Beverley Minster</a> in the diocese of York, adding a <a href="Presbytery%20%28architecture%29">presbytery</a> and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering "all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower...intermingled with gold in various ways, and in a wonderful fashion". He added a pulpit "in German style" of bronze, gold and silver, surmounted by an arch with a <a href="rood">rood</a> cross in the same materials; these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest.

Ealdred encouraged Folcard, a monk of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury</a>, to write the "Life" of Saint <a href="John%20of%20Beverley">John of Beverley</a>. This was part of Ealdred's promotion of the cult of Saint John, who had only been canonised in 1037. Along with the "Pontificale", Ealdred may have brought back from Cologne the first manuscript of the "<a href="Cambridge%20Songs">Cambridge Songs</a>" to enter England, a collection of Latin <a href="Goliard">Goliard</a>ic songs which became famous in the Middle Ages. The historian Michael Lapidge suggests that the "Laudes Regiae", which are included in Cotton Vitellius E xii, might have been composed by Ealdred, or a member of his household. Another historian, H. J. Cowdrey, argued that the "laudes" were composed at Winchester. These praise songs are probably the same performed at Matilda's coronation, but might have been used at other court ceremonies before Ealdred's death.

Historians have seen Ealdred as an "old-fashioned prince-bishop". Others say that he "raised the see of York from its former rustic state". He was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities. After the Conquest, Ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre- and post-Conquest worlds. One modern historian feels that it was Ealdred who was behind the compilation of the D version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", and gives a date in the 1050s as its composition. Certainly, Ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work, and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the version.

Andrew Jackson

Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the seventh <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from 1829 to 1837. Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and served in both houses of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the "common man" against a "corrupt aristocracy" and to preserve the Union.

Born in the colonial <a href="Waxhaws">Carolinas</a> to a <a href="Scotch-Irish%20Americans">Scotch-Irish</a> family in the decade before the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Jackson became a <a href="American%20frontier">frontier</a> lawyer and married <a href="Rachel%20Donelson%20Robards">Rachel Donelson Robards</a>. He served briefly in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, representing <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. After resigning, he served as a <a href="List%20of%20Justices%20of%20the%20Tennessee%20Supreme%20Court">justice</a> on the <a href="Tennessee%20Supreme%20Court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a> from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">The Hermitage</a>, and became a wealthy, slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the <a href="Creek%20War">Creek War</a> of 1813–1814, winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Horseshoe%20Bend%20%281814%29">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a>. The subsequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Jackson">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a> required the <a href="Muscogee">Creek</a> surrender of vast lands in present-day <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. In the concurrent <a href="War%20of%201812">war against the British</a>, Jackson's victory in 1815 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a> made him a national hero. Jackson then led U.S. forces in the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>, which led to the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">annexation</a> of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824</a>, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> in a <a href="contingent%20election">contingent election</a>. In reaction to the alleged "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" between Adams and <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a>.

Jackson ran again in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a>, defeating Adams in a landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> over what opponents called the "<a href="Tariff%20of%20Abominations">Tariff of Abominations</a>." The <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">crisis</a> was defused when the tariff was <a href="Tariff%20of%201833">amended</a>, and Jackson <a href="Force%20Bill">threatened</a> the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy <a href="Bank%20War">struggle</a>, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party "<a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a>, which forcibly <a href="Trail%20of%20Tears">relocated</a> most members of the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes in the South to <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. Jackson opposed the <a href="abolitionism">abolitionist</a> movement, which grew stronger in his second term. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a "most favored nation" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and recognized the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president.

In his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> and <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>. Though fearful of its effects on the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> debate, Jackson advocated the <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annexation of Texas</a>, which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson has been widely revered in the United States as an advocate for democracy and the common man. Many of his actions proved divisive, garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country. His reputation has suffered since the 1970s, largely due to his role in Indian removal. Surveys of historians and scholars have <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">ranked</a> Jackson favorably among U.S. presidents.

Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767 in the <a href="Waxhaws">Waxhaws</a> region of the Carolinas. His parents were <a href="Scotch-Irish%20Americans">Scots-Irish</a> colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, <a href="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a> who had emigrated from present day <a href="Ulster">Northern Ireland</a> two years earlier. Jackson's father was born in <a href="Carrickfergus">Carrickfergus</a>, <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738. Jackson's parents lived in the village of <a href="Boneybefore">Boneybefore</a>, also in County Antrim. His paternal family line originated in <a href="Eske">Killingswold Grove</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, England.

When they immigrated to North America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Most likely they traveled overland through the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws, straddling the border between <a href="North%20Carolina">North</a> and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). Jackson's father died in a logging accident while clearing land in February 1767 at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born. Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region, and Jackson received schooling from two nearby priests.

Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother's actions immediately following her husband's funeral. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle James Crawford in <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Lancaster County, South Carolina</a>. Jackson may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the <a href="Tariff%20of%201824">Tariff of 1824</a>, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina. As a young boy, Jackson was easily offended and was considered something of a bully. He was, however, said to have taken a group of younger and weaker boys under his wing and been very kind to them.

During the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, Jackson's eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stono%20Ferry">Battle of Stono Ferry</a> on June 20, 1779. Anti-British sentiment intensified following the brutal <a href="Battle%20of%20Waxhaws">Waxhaws Massacre</a> on May 29, 1780. Jackson's mother encouraged him and his elder brother Robert to attend the local militia drills. Soon, they began to help the militia as couriers. They served under Colonel <a href="William%20Richardson%20Davie">William Richardson Davie</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hanging%20Rock">Battle of Hanging Rock</a> on August 6. Andrew and Robert were captured by the British in 1781 while staying at the home of the Crawford family. When Andrew refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving him with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British. Robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword. The two brothers were held as prisoners, contracted <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and nearly starved to death in captivity.

Later that year, their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. She then began to walk both boys back to their home in the Waxhaws, a distance of some 40 miles (64 km). Both were in very poor health. Robert, who was far worse, rode on the only horse that they had, while Andrew walked behind them. In the final two hours of the journey, a torrential downpour began which worsened the effects of the smallpox. Within two days of arriving back home, Robert was dead and Andrew in mortal danger. After nursing Andrew back to health, Elizabeth volunteered to nurse American <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> on board two British ships in the <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> harbor, where there had been an outbreak of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>. In November, she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave. Andrew became an orphan at age 14. He blamed the British personally for the loss of his brothers and mother.

After the Revolutionary War, Jackson received a sporadic education in a local Waxhaw school. On bad terms with much of his extended family, he boarded with several different people. In 1781, he worked for a time as a saddle-maker, and eventually taught school. He apparently prospered in neither profession. In 1784, he left the Waxhaws region for <a href="Salisbury%2C%20North%20Carolina">Salisbury, North Carolina</a>, where he <a href="reading%20law">studied law</a> under attorney Spruce Macay. With the help of various lawyers, he was able to learn enough to <a href="Admission%20to%20practice%20law">qualify for the bar</a>. In September 1787, Jackson was admitted to the North Carolina bar. Shortly thereafter, a friend helped him get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the <a href="Washington%20District%2C%20North%20Carolina">Western District</a> of North Carolina, which would later become the state of Tennessee. During his travel west, Jackson bought his first slave and in 1788, having been offended by fellow lawyer <a href="Waightstill%20Avery">Waightstill Avery</a>, fought his first duel. The duel ended with both men firing into the air, having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement.

Jackson moved to the small frontier town of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> in 1788, where he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockly Donelson, the widow of <a href="John%20Donelson">John Donelson</a>. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, <a href="Rachel%20Jackson">Rachel Donelson Robards</a>. The younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. Her divorce had not been made final, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made. It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

In 1794, Jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer <a href="John%20Overton%20%28judge%29">John Overton</a>, dealing in claims for land reserved by treaty for the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> and <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>. Like many of their contemporaries, they dealt in such claims although the land was in Indian country. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened Indian lands west of the Appalachians within North Carolina to claim by that state's residents. He was one of the three original investors who founded <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in 1819.

After moving to Nashville, Jackson became a protege of <a href="William%20Blount">William Blount</a>, a friend of the Donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the territory. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as a delegate to the Tennessee <a href="constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected its only <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican Party</a>, the dominant party in Tennessee. Jackson soon became associated with the more radical, pro-French and anti-British wing. He strongly opposed the <a href="Jay%20Treaty">Jay Treaty</a> and criticized <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> for allegedly removing Republicans from public office. Jackson joined several other Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington, a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency. In 1797, the state legislature elected him as <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a>. Jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying. He pronounced himself "disgusted with the administration" of President <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> and resigned the following year without explanation. Upon returning home, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected to serve as a judge of the <a href="Tennessee%20Supreme%20Court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a> at an annual salary of $600. Jackson's service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making. Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests.

After arriving in Tennessee, Jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the Tennessee militia. In 1802, while serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he declared his candidacy for major general, or commander, of the Tennessee <a href="Militia%20%28United%20States%29">militia</a>, a position voted on by the officers. At that time, most free men were members of the militia. The organizations, intended to be called up in case of conflict with Europeans or Indians, resembled large social clubs. Jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature. With strong support from western Tennessee, he tied with <a href="John%20Sevier">John Sevier</a> with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, the recognized leader of politics in eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor <a href="Archibald%20Roane">Archibald Roane</a> broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence of land fraud against Sevier. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship, Roane released the evidence. Sevier insulted Jackson in public, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter. Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809.

In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as <a href="Planter%20%28American%20South%29">planter</a>, <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave owner</a>, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in <a href="Gallatin%2C%20Tennessee">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>, in 1803. The next year, he acquired the <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">Hermitage</a>, a plantation in <a href="Davidson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Davidson County</a>, near <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>. He later added to the plantation, which eventually totaled . The primary crop was <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, grown by slaves—Jackson began with nine, owned as many as 44 by 1820, and later up to 150, placing him among the planter elite. Jackson also co-owned with his son Andrew Jackson Jr. the Halcyon plantation in <a href="Coahoma%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Coahoma County, Mississippi</a>, which housed 51 slaves at the time of his death. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.

Men, women, and child slaves were owned by Jackson on three sections of the Hermitage plantation. Slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in cabins made either of brick or logs. The size and quality of the Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food, Jackson supplied them with guns, knives, and fishing equipment. At times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets. The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise. Jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough. At various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation. In one advertisement placed in the Tennessee Gazette in October 1804, Jackson offered "ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred."

The controversy surrounding his marriage to Rachel remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. By May 1806, <a href="Charles%20Dickinson%20%28historical%20figure%29">Charles Dickinson</a>, who, like Jackson, raced horses, had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a <a href="duel">duel</a>. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.

After the Sevier affair and the duel, Jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation. He chose to align himself with former vice president <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, who after leaving office in 1805, his political career over after the killing of <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> in a duel in 1804, went on a tour of what was then the western United States. Burr was extremely well received by the people of Tennessee, and stayed for five days at the Hermitage. Burr's true intentions are not known with certainty. He seems to have been <a href="Burr%20conspiracy">planning</a> a military operation to conquer <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a> and drive the Spanish from <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. To many westerners like Jackson, the promise seemed enticing. Western American settlers had long held bitter feelings towards Spain due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the Spanish to keep Indians living on their lands from raiding American settlements. and by Spain's disinterest in returning <a href="maroons%20%28people%29">fugitive slaves</a>. On October 4, 1806, Jackson addressed the Tennessee militia, declaring that the men should be "at a moment's warning ready to march." On the same day, he wrote to <a href="James%20Winchester">James Winchester</a>, proclaiming that the United States "can conquer not only the Floridas [at that time there was an East Florida and a West Florida.], but all Spanish North America." He continued:

Jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition. However, on November 10, he learned from a military captain that Burr's plans apparently included seizure of New Orleans, then part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> of the United States, and incorporating it, along with lands won from the Spanish, into a new empire. He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of Brigadier General <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>, whom he deeply disliked, in the plan. Jackson acted cautiously at first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, vaguely warning them about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were sent home. Jackson traveled to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand, fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201808">1808</a> against <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>. The latter was part of the Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson lived relatively quietly at the Hermitage in the years after the Burr trial, eventually accumulating 640 acres of land.

Leading up to 1812, the United States found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict. Formal hostilities with Spain or France never materialized, but tensions with Britain increased for a number of <a href="Origins%20of%20the%20War%20of%201812">reasons</a>. Among these was the <a href="Manifest%20destiny">desire</a> of <a href="war%20hawk">many</a> Americans for more land, particularly <a href="Canada%20under%20British%20rule">British Canada</a> and Florida, the latter still controlled by Spain, Britain's European ally. On June 18, 1812, Congress officially declared war on the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, beginning the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Jackson responded enthusiastically, sending a letter to Washington offering 2,500 volunteers. However, the men were not called up for many months. Biographer <a href="Robert%20V.%20Remini">Robert V. Remini</a> claims that Jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the Madison administration for his support of Burr and Monroe. Meanwhile, the United States military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield.

On January 10, 1813, Jackson led an army of 2,071 volunteers to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> to defend the region against British and Native American attacks. He had been instructed to serve under General Wilkinson, who commanded Federal forces in New Orleans. Lacking adequate provisions, Wilkinson ordered Jackson to halt in Natchez, then part of the <a href="Mississippi%20Territory">Mississippi Territory</a>, and await further orders. Jackson reluctantly obeyed. The newly appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="John%20Armstrong%20Jr.">John Armstrong Jr.</a>, sent a letter to Jackson dated February 6 ordering him to dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to Wilkinson. In reply to Armstrong on March 15, Jackson defended the character and readiness of his men, and promised to turn over his supplies. He also promised, instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in Natchez, to march them back to Nashville. The march was filled with agony. Many of the men had fallen ill. Jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick. He paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket. The soldiers began referring to their commander as "Hickory" because of his toughness, and Jackson became known as "Old Hickory." The army arrived in Nashville within about a month. Jackson's actions earned him respect and praise from the people of Tennessee. Jackson faced financial ruin, until his former aide-de-camp <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Benton</a> persuaded Secretary Armstrong to order the army to pay the expenses Jackson had incurred. On June 14, Jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer <a href="William%20Carroll%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">William Carroll</a> against Jesse Benton, the brother of Thomas. In September, Jackson and his top cavalry officer, Brigadier General <a href="John%20Coffee">John Coffee</a>, were involved in a street brawl with the Benton brothers. Jackson was severely wounded by Jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder.

On August 30, a group of <a href="Muscogee">Muscogee</a> (also known as Creek Indians) called the <a href="Red%20Sticks">Red Sticks</a>, so named for the color of their war paint, perpetrated the <a href="Fort%20Mims%20massacre">Fort Mims massacre</a>. During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs <a href="William%20Weatherford">Red Eagle</a> and <a href="Peter%20McQueen">Peter McQueen</a>, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>, a <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> chief who had launched <a href="Tecumseh%27s%20War">Tecumseh's War</a> against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British. The resulting conflict became known as the <a href="Creek%20War">Creek War</a>.
Jackson, with 2,500 men, was ordered to crush the hostile Indians. On October 10, he set out on the expedition, his arm still in a sling from fighting the Bentons. Jackson established <a href="Fort%20Strother">Fort Strother</a> as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tallushatchee">Battle of Tallushatchee</a>. Coming to the relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won another decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talladega">Battle of Talladega</a>. In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother, faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the <a href="Battles%20of%20Emuckfaw%20and%20Enotachopo%20Creek">Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek</a>. Jackson's troops repelled the attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother. Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa River</a>. On March 27, enjoying an advantage of more than 2 to 1, he engaged them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Horseshoe%20Bend%20%281814%29">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a>. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. A subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.

The campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as McQueen fled to <a href="East%20Florida">East Florida</a>. On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, and 10 days later became a <a href="major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a>, in command of the Seventh Military Division. Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's approval, imposed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Jackson">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a>. The treaty required the Muscogee, including those who had not joined the Red Sticks, to surrender 23 million acres (8,093,713 ha) of land to the United States. Most of the Creeks bitterly acquiesced. Though in ill-health from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, Jackson turned his attention to defeating Spanish and British forces. Jackson accused the Spanish of arming the Red Sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing British soldiers into the Floridas. The first charge was true, while the second ignored the fact that it was Jackson's threats to invade Florida which had caused them to seek British protection. In the November 7 <a href="Battle%20of%20Pensacola%20%281814%29">Battle of Pensacola</a>, Jackson defeated British and Spanish forces in a short skirmish. The Spanish surrendered and the British fled. Weeks later, he learned that the British were planning an attack on <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, which sat on the mouth of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and held immense strategic and commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish, placed a force in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> to guard against a possible invasion there, and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city.

The Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, "Jacksa Chula Harjo" or "Jackson, old and fierce."

After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814, Jackson instituted <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">Creole</a> and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with <a href="Jean%20Lafitte">Jean Lafitte</a>'s smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Cochrane">Alexander Cochrane</a> and later General <a href="Edward%20Pakenham">Edward Pakenham</a>, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.
The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23. That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back. On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster. For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured. After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a> had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the "Second American Revolution" against the British. By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the <a href="Thanks%20of%20Congress">Thanks of Congress</a> and awarded a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>.

<a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> ("underwhelmed" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in "<a href="Democracy%20in%20America">Democracy in America</a>" that Jackson "was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans." Some have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure. However, the Spanish, who had sold the Louisiana Territory to France, disputed France's right to sell it to the United States through the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in 1803. Had the British defeated Jackson at New Orleans, they might have held on to the territory or returned it to Spain. Furthermore, Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent stipulated that the United States must return land taken from the Creeks to their original owners, essentially undoing the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Thanks to Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the American government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that Jackson had acquired.

Jackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused to lift martial law in the city. In March 1815, after U.S. District Court Judge <a href="Dominic%20Augustin%20Hall">Dominic A. Hall</a> signed a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" on behalf of a Louisiana legislator whom Jackson had detained, Jackson ordered <a href="Arrest%20of%20Dominic%20Hall%20and%20Louis%20Louaillier">Hall's arrest</a>. State senator Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. He too was put in jail. Jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, and a lawyer, and after the intervention of State Judge <a href="Joshua%20Lewis%20%28judge%29">Joshua Lewis</a>. Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also had signed a writ of "habeas corpus" against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release.

Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson—he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave. Their deaths were not well publicized until the <a href="Coffin%20Handbills">Coffin Handbills</a> were circulated during his 1828 presidential campaign.

Following the war, Jackson remained in command of troops on the southern border of the U.S. He conducted business from the Hermitage. He signed treaties with the Cherokee and Chickasaw which gained for the United States large parts of Tennessee and Kentucky. The treaty with the Chickasaw, finally agreed to later in the year, is commonly known as the <a href="Jackson%20Purchase%20%28U.S.%20historical%20region%29">Jackson Purchase</a>.

Several Native American tribes, which became known as the <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>, straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida. The Seminole, in alliance with escaped slaves, frequently raided Georgia settlements before retreating back into Florida. These skirmishes continually escalated, and the conflict is now known as the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>. In 1816, Jackson led a detachment into Florida which <a href="Battle%20of%20Negro%20Fort">destroyed</a> the <a href="Fort%20Gadsden">Negro Fort</a>, a community of escaped slaves and their descendants. Jackson was ordered by President Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> against the Seminole and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves, after Spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to "terminate the conflict." Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."

Jackson invaded Florida on March 15, 1818, capturing Pensacola. He crushed Seminole and Spanish resistance in the region and captured two British agents, <a href="Arbuthnot%20and%20Ambrister%20incident">Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot</a>, who had been working with the Seminole. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of the men, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had not <a href="Declaration%20of%20war%20by%20the%20United%20States">declared war</a> upon Spain. He was defended by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>. After the ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821, Jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial <a href="Governor%20of%20Florida">Governor of Florida</a> before returning to Tennessee.

In the spring of 1822, Jackson suffered a physical breakdown. His body had two bullets lodged in it, and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning. He regularly coughed up blood, and his entire body shook. Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death. After several months of rest, he recovered. During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs. He obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>, blaming it for causing the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> by contracting credit.

Jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state, but accepted <a href="John%20Overton%20%28judge%29">John Overton's</a> plan to have the legislature nominate him for president. On July 22, 1822, he was officially nominated by the Tennessee legislature. Jackson had come to dislike Secretary of the Treasury <a href="William%20H.%20Crawford">William H. Crawford</a>, who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford. Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. The Panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular. With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. During the <a href="Era%20of%20Good%20Feelings">Era of Good Feelings</a>, the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major issues of the day, most prominently the <a href="Tariff%20of%201824">tariff</a>, Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption. Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.

In 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats. The move was independently orchestrated by his advisors <a href="William%20Berkeley%20Lewis">William Berkeley Lewis</a> and U.S. Senator <a href="John%20Eaton%20%28politician%29">John Eaton</a> in order to defeat incumbent <a href="John%20Williams%20%28Tennessee%29">John Williams</a>, who openly opposed his presidential candidacy. The legislature narrowly elected him. His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history. Although Jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the Senate, he was appointed chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>. Eaton wrote to Rachel that Jackson as a senator was "in harmony and good understanding with every body," including Thomas Hart Benton, now a senator from Missouri, with whom Jackson had fought in 1813. Meanwhile, Jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency, as was customary. Eaton updated an already-written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and, along with others, wrote letters to newspapers praising Jackson's record and past conduct.

Democratic-Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal <a href="Congressional%20nominating%20caucus">Congressional nominating caucus</a>es, but this method had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for president and <a href="Albert%20Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a> for vice president. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" in the "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate." Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office." After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.

In the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral vote</a>, taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a <a href="contingent%20election">contingent election</a> under the terms of the <a href="Twelfth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a>. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election, saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded <a href="internal%20improvement">internal improvement</a>s such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot. Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State. "So you see," Jackson growled, "the Judas of the West has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver. [H]is end will be the same." After the election, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.

Almost immediately, opposition arose to the Adams presidency. Jackson opposed Adams's plan to involve the U.S. in <a href="Panama">Panama</a>'s quest for independence, writing, "The moment we engage in confederations, or alliances with any nation, we may from that time date the down fall of our republic." Adams damaged his standing in his first annual message to Congress, when he argued that Congress must not give the world the impression "that we are palsied by the will of our constituents."

Jackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and Adams's followers became known as the <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republicans</a>. In the large Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a favorite.

The campaign was heavily personal. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press. Jackson was labelled a <a href="slave%20trader">slave trader</a> who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior. A series of pamphlets known as the <a href="Coffin%20Handbills">Coffin Handbills</a> were published to attack Jackson, one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at New Orleans. Another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of American Indians killed in battle, while still another labeled his mother a "common prostitute" and stated that Jackson's father was a "mulatto man."

Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson. Jackson's campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as Minister to Russia, Adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Emperor Alexander I</a>. They also stated that Adams had a billiard table in the White House and that he had charged the government for it.

Rachel had been under extreme stress during the election, and often struggled while Jackson was away. She began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season. Jackson described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast." After struggling for three days, Rachel finally died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828 three weeks after her husband's victory in the election (which began on October 31 and ended on December 2) and 10 weeks before Jackson took office as president. A distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body. He felt that the abuse from Adams's supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him. Rachel was buried at the Hermitage on Christmas Eve. "May God Almighty forgive her murderers," Jackson swore at her funeral. "I never can."

Jackson's name has been associated with Jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. "The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics. Jackson's philosophy as president was similar to that of Jefferson, advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary generation. Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption. He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republican values</a>. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law, he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.

Jackson believed in the ability of the people to "arrive at right conclusions." They had the right not only to elect but to "instruct their agents & representatives." Office holders should either obey the popular will or resign. He rejected the view of a powerful and independent <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> with binding decisions, arguing that "the Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>." Jackson thought that Supreme Court justices should be made to stand for election, and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to ensure democratic rule. He called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the Electoral College. Jackson "was far ahead of his times–and maybe even further than this country can ever achieve."

Jackson departed from the Hermitage on January 19 and arrived in Washington on February 11. He then set about choosing his cabinet members. Jackson chose Van Buren as expected for Secretary of State, Eaton of Tennessee as Secretary of War, <a href="Samuel%20D.%20Ingham">Samuel D. Ingham</a> of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, <a href="John%20Branch">John Branch</a> of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, <a href="John%20M.%20Berrien">John M. Berrien</a> of Georgia as Attorney General, and <a href="William%20T.%20Barry">William T. Barry</a> of Kentucky as Postmaster General. Jackson's first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip. Jackson blamed Adams in part for what was said about Rachel during the campaign, and refused to meet him after arriving in Washington. Therefore, Adams chose not to attend the inauguration.

On March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol. In his inaugural speech, Jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency. He also promised to pursue "reform" by removing power from "unfaithful or incompetent hands." At the conclusion of the ceremony, Jackson invited the public to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, where his supporters held a raucous party. Thousands of spectators overwhelmed the White House staff, and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings. Jackson's populism earned him the nickname "King Mob."

Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the "Petticoat affair" or "Eaton affair." Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's cabinet members and their wives, including Calhoun's wife <a href="Floride%20Calhoun">Floride Calhoun</a>, concerning Secretary of War Eaton and his wife <a href="Margaret%20O%27Neill%20Eaton">Peggy Eaton</a>. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Controversy also ensued because Peggy had married soon after her previous husband's death, and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. Allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkable—but Jackson refused to believe the rumors, telling his Cabinet that "She is as chaste as a virgin!" Jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, who in essence questioned and dishonored Jackson himself by, in attempting to drive the Eatons out, daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet. Jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife. These memories increased his dedication to defending Peggy Eaton.

Meanwhile, the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women was at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian <a href="Daniel%20Walker%20Howe">Daniel Walker Howe</a> notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.

In the spring of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except Barry. Van Buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would "...kill [Van Buren], sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick." Van Buren continued to serve as an important adviser to Jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the 1832 election, making him Jackson's heir-apparent. The Petticoat affair led to the development of the <a href="Kitchen%20Cabinet">Kitchen Cabinet</a>. The Kitchen Cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging.

Throughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with Native American tribes both in the <a href="Old%20Southwest">South</a> and the <a href="Old%20Northwest">Northwest</a>. Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-<a href="European%20American">Anglo</a> American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal. Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included the <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Muscogee">Creek</a>, <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> and the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. The northwest tribes include the <a href="Chippewa">Chippewa</a>, <a href="Odawa">Ottawa</a>, and the <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>.

Relations between Indians and Americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts. Previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to "civilize" the Indians, but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention. There had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue, and out of this policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.

In his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> be set aside for Indian tribes. On May 26, 1830, Congress passed the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a>, which Jackson signed into law two days later. The Act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders. The act specifically pertained to the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law, effectively relinquishing their sovereignty.
Jackson, Eaton, and General Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move. Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw. Lacking Jackson's skills at negotiation, they frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission. The tactics worked, and the chiefs <a href="Treaty%20of%20Dancing%20Rabbit%20Creek">agreed</a> to move. The removal of the Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering. The Seminole, despite the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Payne%27s%20Landing">Treaty of Payne's Landing</a> in 1832, refused to move. In December 1835, this dispute began the <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a>. The war lasted over six years, finally ending in 1842. Members of the Creek Nation had signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Cusseta">Treaty of Cusseta</a> in 1832, allowing the Creek to either sell or retain their land. Conflict later erupted between the Creek who remained and the white settlers, leading to a second <a href="Creek%20War%20of%201836">Creek War</a>. A common complaint amongst the tribes was that the men who had signed the treaties did not represent the whole tribe.

The state of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> became involved in a contentious dispute with the Cherokee, culminating in the 1832 Supreme Court decision in "<a href="Worcester%20v.%20Georgia">Worcester v. Georgia</a>". <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>, writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands, as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople. Jackson is frequently attributed the following response: "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." The quote, apparently indicating Jackson's dismissive view of the courts, was attributed to Jackson by <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, who cited as his source Representative <a href="George%20N.%20Briggs">George N. Briggs</a>. Remini argues that Jackson did not say it because, while it "certainly sounds like Jackson...[t]here was nothing for him to enforce." This is because a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" had never been issued for the missionaries. The Court also did not ask <a href="federal%20marshal">federal marshal</a>s to carry out the decision, as had become standard.

A group of Cherokees led by <a href="John%20Ridge">John Ridge</a> negotiated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20New%20Echota">Treaty of New Echota</a>. Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate. Another faction, led by <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Cherokee%20chief%29">John Ross</a>, unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal. The Cherokee largely considered themselves independent, and not subject to the laws of the United States or Georgia. The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren. Subsequently, as many as 4,000 out of 18,000 Cherokees died on the "<a href="Trail%20of%20Tears">Trail of Tears</a>" in 1838. More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high <a href="Great%20Smoky%20Mountains">Smoky Mountains</a>. The <a href="Black%20Hawk%20War">Black Hawk War</a> took place during Jackson's presidency in 1832 after a group of Indians crossed into U.S. territory.

In an effort to purge the government of corruption, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments. He believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies. He asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster General Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, as well as failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances. Jackson replaced Barry with Treasury Auditor and prominent Kitchen Cabinet member <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a>, who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Post Office Department.
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as president. In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."

Although he was unable to implement these goals, Jackson's time in office did see a variety of other reforms. He supported an act in July 1836 that enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband's pensions. In 1836, Jackson established the ten-hour day in national shipyards.

Jackson enforced the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281820%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, signed by President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">rotation in office</a> was a democratic reform preventing hereditary officeholding and made civil service responsible to the popular will. Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed." Jackson noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another." Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. Jackson, nonetheless, used his presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster, Jackson stated, "[i]f he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."

Jackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>. The political realities of Washington sometimes forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations. Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades) proved to be difficult. Remini claims that because "friendship, politics, and geography constituted the President's total criteria for appointments, most of his appointments were predictably substandard."

In 1828, Congress had approved the "<a href="Tariff%20of%20Abominations">Tariff of Abominations</a>", which set the tariff at an historically high rate. Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they saw as favoring northern interests. The South now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally; and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton. The issue came to a head during Jackson's presidency, resulting in the <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">Nullification Crisis</a>, in which South Carolina threatened disunion.

The <a href="South%20Carolina%20Exposition%20and%20Protest">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</a> of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident came at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. <a href="Robert%20Hayne">Robert Hayne</a> began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States." Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!" – a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"

In May 1830, Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure Jackson for his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War. Calhoun's and Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the "United States Telegraph". Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until Jackson stopped it in July. The "Telegraph", edited by <a href="Duff%20Green">Duff Green</a>, initially supported Jackson. After it sided with Calhoun on nullification, Jackson needed a new organ for the administration. He enlisted the help of longtime supporter <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>, who in November 1830 established a newspaper known as the "Washington Globe", which from then on served as the primary mouthpiece of the Democratic Party.

Jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the <a href="Tariff%20of%201832">Tariff of 1832</a>. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary <a href="Louis%20McLane">Louis McLane</a>, the bill lowered duties from 45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the president on July 14. The bill ultimately failed to satisfy extremists on either side. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828. In response, Jackson sent <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> warships to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession. On December 28, 1832, Calhoun resigned as vice president to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina. This was part of a strategy whereby Calhoun, with less than three months remaining on his vice presidential term, would replace <a href="Robert%20Y.%20Hayne">Robert Y. Hayne</a> in the Senate, who would then become governor. Hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the Senate, especially against fierce criticism from Senator <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a> of Massachusetts.

In December 1832, Jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers," stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed." South Carolina, the president declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason," and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a government not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not a nation." Jackson tended to personalize the controversy, frequently characterizing nullification as a conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted.

Jackson asked Congress to pass a "<a href="Force%20Bill">Force Bill</a>" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff. It was introduced by Senator <a href="Felix%20Grundy">Felix Grundy</a> of Tennessee, and was quickly attacked by Calhoun as "military despotism." At the same time, Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new <a href="Tariff%20of%201833">compromise tariff</a>. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative <a href="Gulian%20C.%20Verplanck">Gulian C. Verplanck</a> of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency. The Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833. The Force Bill passed the same day. Calhoun, Clay, and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition, with the only dissenting vote coming from <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> of Virginia. The new tariff was opposed by Webster, who argued that it essentially surrendered to South Carolina's demands. Jackson, despite his anger over the scrapping of the Verplanck bill and the new alliance between Clay and Calhoun, saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis. He signed both bills on March 2, starting with the Force Bill. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. On May 1, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">disunion</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">southern confederacy</a> the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> question."

Addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his First Annual Address to Congress, Jackson declared it to be his "settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong."

When Jackson took office, spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the <a href="Napoleon">Napoleonic era</a>, caused strained relations between the U.S. and French governments. The <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules. According to Secretary of State <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, relations between the U.S. and France were "hopeless." Jackson's Minister to France, <a href="William%20Cabell%20Rives">William C. Rives</a>, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831, that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages. The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties. The French king <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe I</a> and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In , Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France. Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until Jackson had apologized for his remarks. In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, reparations were paid.

In addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="Siam">Siam</a>. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.

Jackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. Jackson was hesitant in recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected president. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating <a href="Alc%C3%A9e%20Louis%20la%20Branche">Alcée Louis la Branche</a> as chargé d'affaires on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.

Jackson failed in his efforts to open trade with China and Japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.

The <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832 presidential election</a> demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period. The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Henry Clay, now a senator from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="John%20Sergeant%20%28politician%29">John Sergeant</a> of Pennsylvania. The <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a> emerged by capitalizing on opposition to <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>, which existed primarily in New England, after the disappearance and possible murder of <a href="William%20Morgan%20%28anti-Mason%29">William Morgan</a>. The party, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a> of Maryland and <a href="Amos%20Ellmaker">Amos Ellmaker</a> of Pennsylvania. Clay was, like Jackson, a Mason, and so some anti-Jacksonians who would have supported the National Republican Party supported Wirt instead.

In 1816, the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> was chartered by President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812. Monroe had appointed <a href="Nicholas%20Biddle%20%28banker%29">Nicholas Biddle</a> as the Bank's executive. Jackson believed that the Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful." He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections. In his address to Congress in 1830, Jackson called for a substitute for the Bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land. Its only power would be to issue bills of exchange. The address touched off fiery debate in the Senate. Thomas Hart Benton, now a strong supporter of the president despite the brawl years earlier, gave a speech strongly denouncing the Bank and calling for open debate on its recharter. Webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution. Shortly afterward, the "Globe" announced that Jackson would stand for reelection.

Despite his misgivings about the Bank, he supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary <a href="Louis%20McLane">Louis McLane</a>, who was secretly working with Biddle, to recharter a reformed version of the Bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation's debt. This would be done, in part, through the sale of government stock in the Bank. Over the objections of <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a>, an irreconcilable opponent of the Bank, Jackson allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the Bank.

Clay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill. He and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration. Biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. On January 6, 1832 Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter without any of the proposed reforms. The submission came four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832. Jackson determined to veto it. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson declared, "The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it." Jackson officially vetoed the bill on July 10. The veto message was crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew and advisor <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a>. It attacked the Bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy. The veto was considered "one of the strongest and most controversial" presidential statements and "a brilliant political manifesto." The <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republican Party</a> immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue. Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.

At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process. On July 21, Clay said privately, "The campaign is over, and I think we have won the victory." Jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match for Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity. Jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. Jackson won the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party eventually declined. Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.

In 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation. Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. He removed McLane from the Treasury Department, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing <a href="Edward%20Livingston">Edward Livingston</a>. He replaced McLane with <a href="William%20J.%20Duane">William J. Duane</a>. In September, he fired Duane for refusing to remove the deposits. Signalling his intent to continue battling the Bank, he replaced Duane with Taney. Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed. They were placed in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration's policies, known to critics as <a href="pet%20banks">pet banks</a>. Biddle responded by stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic. The moves were intended to force Jackson into a compromise. "Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress," he wrote. At first, Biddle's strategy was successful, putting enormous pressure on Jackson. But Jackson handled the situation well. When people came to him complaining, he referred them to Biddle, saying that he was the man who had "all the money." Jackson's approach worked. Biddle's strategy backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment.

In 1834, those who disagreed with Jackson's expansion of executive power united and formed the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>, calling Jackson "King Andrew I," and named their party after the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">English Whigs</a> who <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">opposed</a> seventeenth century British monarchy. A movement emerged among Whigs in the Senate to censure Jackson. The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Clay, which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and Jackson. Jackson called Clay "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel." On March 28, the Senate voted to censure Jackson 26–20. It also rejected Taney as Treasury Secretary. The House however, led by <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a> chairman <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>, declared on April 4 that the Bank "ought not to be rechartered" and that the depositions "ought not to be restored." It voted to continue allowing pet banks to be places of deposit and voted even more overwhelmingly to investigate whether the Bank had deliberately instigated the panic. Jackson called the passage of these resolutions a "glorious triumph." It essentially sealed the Bank's demise. The Democrats later suffered a temporary setback. Polk ran for Speaker of the House to replace <a href="Andrew%20Stevenson">Andrew Stevenson</a>. After Southerners discovered his connection to Van Buren, he was defeated by fellow-Tennessean <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, a Democrat-turned-Whig who opposed Jackson's removal policy.

The national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills.

On January 1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his vetoes of legislation had he deemed extravagant. In December 1835, Polk defeated Bell in a rematch and was elected Speaker. Finally, on January 16, 1837, when the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters. The expunction movement was led ironically by Benton.

In 1836, in response to increased land speculation, Jackson issued the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a>, an <a href="executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">executive order</a> that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was high demand for specie, which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes, contributing to the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. The White House Van Buren biography notes, "Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of 'boom and bust,' which was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular..."

The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at Jackson. He had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the navy for <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS "Cygnet" to <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of <a href="Mary%20Ball%20Washington">Mary Ball Washington</a>, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s mother. During a stopover near <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a>, Randolph appeared and struck the president. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the writer <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>. Jackson declined to press charges.

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the United States occurred just outside the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a>. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> Representative <a href="Warren%20R.%20Davis">Warren R. Davis</a>, <a href="Richard%20Lawrence%20%28failed%20assassin%29">Richard Lawrence</a>, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including <a href="Davy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCrockett">Davy Crockett</a>, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Lawrence offered a variety of explanations for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the president dead, "money would be more plenty," (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell." Finally, Lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed English king—specifically, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a>, dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.

Afterwards, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same <a href="Divine%20providence">Providence</a> that also protected their young nation. The incident became a part of Jacksonian mythos. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life. His suspicions were never proven.

During the summer of 1835, Northern <a href="abolitionism">abolitionists</a> began sending anti-slavery tracts through the postal system into the South. Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials, which were deemed "incendiary," and some began to riot. Jackson wanted sectional peace, and desired to placate Southerners ahead of the 1836 election. He fiercely disliked the abolitionists, whom he believed were, by instituting sectional jealousies, attempting to destroy the Union. Jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection. He supported the solution of Postmaster General Amos Kendall, which gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts. That December, Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of "incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection."

Jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office. The last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823, led by <a href="Stephen%20Harriman%20Long">Stephen H. Harriman</a> on the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red River of the North</a>. Jackson's predecessor, President Adams, attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adams' expedition plans. Eventually, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to Jefferson and the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, Jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a>. Jackson put Secretary of the Navy <a href="Mahlon%20Dickerson">Mahlon Dickerson</a> in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, during the presidency of Van Buren. One <a href="brig">brig</a> ship, , later used in the expedition; having been commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, confirming the existence of the <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> continent.

In spite of economic success following Jackson's vetoes and war against the Bank, reckless speculation in land and railroads eventually caused the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841, when the economy began to rebound.

Jackson appointed six justices to the Supreme Court. Most were undistinguished. His first appointee, <a href="John%20McLean">John McLean</a>, had been nominated in Barry's place after Barry had agreed to become postmaster general. McLean "turned Whig and forever schemed to win" the presidency. His next two appointees–<a href="Henry%20Baldwin%20%28judge%29">Henry Baldwin</a> and <a href="James%20Moore%20Wayne">James Moore Wayne</a>–disagreed with Jackson on some points but were poorly regarded even by Jackson's enemies. In reward for his services, Jackson nominated Taney to the Court to fill a vacancy in January 1835, but the nomination failed to win Senate approval. Chief Justice Marshall died in 1835, leaving two vacancies on the court. Jackson nominated Taney for Chief Justice and <a href="Philip%20Pendleton%20Barbour">Philip Pendleton Barbour</a> for Associate Justice. Both were confirmed by the new Senate. Taney served as Chief Justice until 1864, presiding over a <a href="Taney%20Court">court</a> that upheld many of the precedents set by the <a href="Marshall%20Court">Marshall Court</a>. He was generally regarded as a good and respectable judge, but his opinion in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" largely overshadows his career. On the last full day of his presidency, Jackson nominated <a href="John%20Catron">John Catron</a>, who was confirmed.

Two new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson's presidency: <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> (June 15, 1836) and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> (January 26, 1837). Both states increased Democratic power in Congress and helped Van Buren win the presidency in 1836. This was in keeping with the tradition that new states would support the party which had done the most to admit them.

In 1837, after serving two terms as president, Jackson was replaced by his chosen successor Martin Van Buren and retired to the Hermitage. He immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics. He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union." Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the Specie Circular as president.

As a solution to the panic, he supported an <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of <a href="Hard%20money%20%28policy%29">gold or silver</a> and would be restricted from printing <a href="Banknote">paper money</a> so as to prevent further <a href="inflation">inflation</a>. A coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 presidential election</a>. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats when Jackson ran. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee. He favored the nomination of Polk for vice president at the <a href="1840%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1840 Democratic National Convention</a> over controversial incumbent <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>. No nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.

Harrison won the election, and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress. "The democracy of the United States has been shamefully beaten," Jackson wrote to Van Buren. "but I trust, not conquered." Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler. Jackson was encouraged because Tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines. Sure enough, Tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank, bringing satisfaction to Jackson and other Democrats. After the second veto, Tyler's entire cabinet, with the exception of <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, resigned.

Jackson strongly favored the <a href="Texas%20annexation">annexation of Texas</a>, a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency. While Jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment, his belief that the British would use Texas as a base to threaten the United States overrode his other concerns. He also insisted that Texas was part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States. At the request of Senator <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> of Mississippi, acting on behalf of the Tyler administration, which also supported annexation, Jackson wrote several letters to Texas president <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the United States would benefit Texas. Initially prior to the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844 election</a>, Jackson again supported Van Buren for president and Polk for vice president. A treaty of annexation was signed by Tyler on April 12, 1844, and submitted to the Senate. When a letter from Secretary of State Calhoun to British Ambassador <a href="Richard%20Pakenham">Richard Pakenham</a> linking annexation to slavery was made public, anti-annexation sentiment exploded in the North and the bill failed to be ratified. Van Buren decided to write the "Hamlet letter," opposing annexation. This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the South. The Whig nominee, Henry Clay, also opposed annexation, and Jackson recognized the need for the Democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the South. If the plan failed, Jackson warned, Texas would not join the Union and would potentially fall victim to a Mexican invasion supported by the British.

Jackson met with Polk, <a href="Robert%20Armstrong%20%281792%E2%80%931854%29">Robert Armstrong</a>, and Andrew Jackson Donelson in his study. He then pointed directly at a startled Polk, telling him that, as a man from the southwest and a supporter of annexation, he would be the perfect candidate. Polk called the scheme "utterly abortive," but agreed to go along with it. At the <a href="1844%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1844 Democratic National Convention</a>, Polk emerged as the party's nominee after Van Buren failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates. <a href="George%20M.%20Dallas">George M. Dallas</a> was selected for vice president. Jackson convinced Tyler to drop his plans of running for re-election as an independent by promising, as Tyler requested, to welcome the president and his allies back into the Democratic Party and by instructing Blair to stop criticizing the president. Polk won the election, defeating Clay. A bill of annexation was passed by Congress in February and signed by Tyler on March 1.

Jackson died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a> and <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. According to a newspaper account from the Boon Lick Times, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. ... When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live." In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to Andrew Jackson Jr. except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members.

Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and <a href="Lyncoya%20Jackson">Lyncoya</a>, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Battle of Tallushatchee. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis on July 1, 1828, at the age of sixteen.

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, <a href="Daniel%20Smith%20Donelson">Daniel Smith Donelson</a>, and Andrew Jackson Donelson were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece <a href="Emily%20Donelson">Emily Donelson</a> to serve as hostess at the White House. Emily was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson, who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 ran for vice president on the <a href="Know%20Nothing">American Party</a> ticket. The relationship between the president and Emily became strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess. <a href="Sarah%20Yorke%20Jackson">Sarah Yorke Jackson</a>, the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used <a href="Rip%20Raps">Rip Raps</a> as a retreat.

Jackson's quick temper was notorious. Biographer <a href="H.%20W.%20Brands">H. W. Brands</a> notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: "Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. ... His close associates all had stories of his blood-curdling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his record—in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously."

On the last day of his presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun." On his deathbed, he was once again quoted as regretting that he had not hanged Calhoun for treason. "My country would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come," he said. Remini expresses the opinion that Jackson was typically in control of his temper, and that he used his anger, along with his fearsome reputation, as a tool to get what he wanted.

Jackson was a lean figure, standing at tall, and weighing between on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough. Much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.

In 1838, Jackson became an official member of the <a href="Downtown%20Presbyterian%20Church%20%28Nashville%29">First Presbyterian Church</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>. Both his mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives, but Jackson himself had postponed officially entering the church in order to avoid accusations that he was joining only for political reasons.

Jackson was a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, initiated at Harmony Lodge No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have served as Grand Master of a state's Grand Lodge until <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> in 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Museum">Tennessee State Museum</a>. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the Hermitage.

Jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in American history. Historian <a href="Charles%20Grier%20Sellers">Charles Grier Sellers</a> says, "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage." There has never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for "his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers." He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies. He has been lauded as the champion of the common man, while criticized for his treatment of Indians and for other matters. <a href="James%20Parton">James Parton</a> was the first man after Jackson's death to write a full biography of him. Trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject, he wrote:

Jackson was criticized by his contemporary <a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> in "<a href="Democracy%20in%20America">Democracy in America</a>" for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:

In the 20th century, Jackson was written about by many admirers. <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.</a>'s "Age of Jackson" (1945) depicts Jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper-class tyranny. From the 1970s to the 1980s, Robert Remini published a three-volume biography of Jackson followed by an abridged one-volume study. Remini paints a generally favorable portrait of Jackson. He contends that Jacksonian democracy "stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history—<a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populism</a>, <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressivism</a>, the <a href="New%20Deal">New</a> and <a href="Fair%20Deal">Fair</a> Deals, and the programs of the <a href="New%20Frontier">New Frontier</a> and <a href="Great%20Society">Great Society</a>." To Remini, Jackson serves as "the embodiment of the new American ... This new man was no longer British. He no longer wore the queue and silk pants. He wore trousers, and he had stopped speaking with a British accent." Other 20th-century writers such as <a href="Richard%20Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> and <a href="Bray%20Hammond">Bray Hammond</a> depict Jackson as an advocate of the sort of "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>" capitalism that benefits the rich and oppresses the poor.

Jackson's initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Indians and American settlers has been a source of controversy. Starting mainly around 1970, Jackson came under attack from some historians on this issue. <a href="Howard%20Zinn">Howard Zinn</a> called him "the most aggressive enemy of the Indians in early American history" and "exterminator of Indians." Conversely, in 1969, <a href="Francis%20Paul%20Prucha">Francis Paul Prucha</a> argued that Jackson's removal of the "Five Civilized Tribes" from the extremely hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very existence. Similarly, Remini claims that, if not for Jackson's policies, the Southern tribes would have been totally wiped out, just like other tribes-namely, the <a href="Yamasee">Yamasee</a>, <a href="Mahican">Mahican</a>, and <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansett</a>–which did not move. Jackson has long been honored, along with Thomas Jefferson, in the <a href="Jefferson%E2%80%93Jackson%20Day">Jefferson–Jackson Day</a> fundraising dinners held by state Democratic Party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders. Because both Jefferson and Jackson were slave owners, as well as because of Jackson's Indian removal policies, many state party organizations have renamed the dinners.

Brands argues that Jackson's reputation suffered since the 1960s as his actions towards Indians and African Americans received new attention. He also claims that the Indian controversy overshadowed Jackson's other achievements. Brands notes that he was often hailed during his lifetime as the "second George Washington," because, while Washington had fought for independence, Jackson confirmed it at New Orleans and made the United States a <a href="great%20power">great power</a>. Over time, while the Revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience, memory of the War of 1812, including the Battle of New Orleans, has sharply declined. Brands argues that this is because once America had become a military power, "it was easy to think that America had been destined for this role from the beginning."

Still, Jackson's performance in office compared to other presidents has generally been ranked in the top half in public opinion polling. His position in <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a>'s poll dropped from 13th in 2009 to 18th in 2017.

Jackson <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents%20on%20currency%23Andrew%20Jackson">has appeared</a> on U.S. banknotes as far back as 1869, and extending into the 21st century. His image has appeared on the $5, $10, $20 and $10,000 note. Most recently, his image has appeared on the U.S. $20 Federal reserve note beginning in 1928. In 2016, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Lew">Jack Lew</a> announced his goal that by 2020 an image of <a href="Harriet%20Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> would replace Jackson's depiction on the front side of the $20 banknote, and that an image of Jackson would be placed on the reverse side, though the final decision will be made by his successors.

Jackson has appeared on several postage stamps. He first appeared on an 1863 two-cent stamp, which is commonly referred to by collectors as the "<a href="Black%20Jack%20%28stamp%29">Black Jack</a>" due to the large <a href="portrait%20painting">portraiture</a> of Jackson on its face printed in pitch black. During the American Civil War, the Confederate government issued two <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate postage stamps</a> bearing Jackson's portrait, one a and the other a , both issued in 1863.

Numerous counties and cities are named after him, including the city of Jacksonville in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>; the cities of Jackson in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Missouri">Missouri</a>, and <a href="Jackson%2C%20Tennessee">Tennessee</a>; Jackson County in <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Ohio">Ohio</a>, and <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Oregon</a>; and <a href="Jackson%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Jackson Parish</a> in Louisiana.

Memorials to Jackson include a set of four identical <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a>s by the sculptor <a href="Clark%20Mills%20%28sculptor%29">Clark Mills</a>: in <a href="Lafayette%20Square%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Lafayette Square</a>, Washington, D.C.; in <a href="Jackson%20Square%20%28New%20Orleans%29">Jackson Square</a>, New Orleans; in Nashville on the grounds of the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Capitol">Tennessee State Capitol</a>; and in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Other equestrian statues of Jackson have been erected elsewhere, as in the State Capitol grounds in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>. That statue controversially identifies him as one of the "presidents North Carolina gave the nation," and he is featured alongside James Polk and <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, both U.S. presidents born in North Carolina. There is a bust of Andrew Jackson in <a href="Plaza%20Ferdinand%20VII">Plaza Ferdinand VII</a> in <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, where he became the first governor of the <a href="Florida%20Territory">Florida Territory</a> in 1821. There is also a 1928 <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20%28National%20Statuary%20Hall%20Collection%29">bronze sculpture</a> of Andrew Jackson by <a href="Belle%20Kinney%20Scholz">Belle Kinney Scholz</a> and <a href="Leopold%20Scholz">Leopold Scholz</a> in the U.S. Capitol Building as part of the <a href="National%20Statuary%20Hall%20Collection">National Statuary Hall Collection</a>.

Jackson and his wife Rachel were the main subjects of a 1951 historical novel by <a href="Irving%20Stone">Irving Stone</a>, "The President's Lady", which told the story of their lives up until Rachel's death. The novel was the basis for the <a href="The%20President%27s%20Lady">1953 film of the same name</a> starring <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> as Jackson and <a href="Susan%20Hayward">Susan Hayward</a> as Rachel.

Jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions. <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a> played Jackson in "<a href="The%20Gorgeous%20Hussy">The Gorgeous Hussy</a>" (1936), a fictionalized biography of Peggy Eaton starring <a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>. "<a href="The%20Buccaneer%20%281938%20film%29">The Buccaneer</a>" (1938), depicting the Battle of New Orleans, included Hugh Sothern as Jackson, and was <a href="The%20Buccaneer%20%281958%20film%29">remade in 1958</a> with Heston again playing Jackson. <a href="Basil%20Ruysdael">Basil Ruysdael</a> played Jackson in <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s 1955 <a href="Davy%20Crockett%20%28TV%20miniseries%29">"Davy Crockett" TV miniseries</a>. <a href="Wesley%20Addy">Wesley Addy</a> appeared as Jackson in some episodes of the 1976 <a href="PBS">PBS</a> <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> "<a href="The%20Adams%20Chronicles">The Adams Chronicles</a>".

Jackson is the protagonist of the comedic historic rock musical "<a href="Bloody%20Bloody%20Andrew%20Jackson">Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</a>" (2008) with music and lyrics by <a href="Michael%20Friedman%20%28composer%29">Michael Friedman</a> and book by <a href="Alex%20Timbers">Alex Timbers</a>.

Archimedes

Archimedes of Syracuse (; ; ) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="Greek%20mathematics">mathematician</a>, <a href="physics">physicist</a>, <a href="engineering">engineer</a>, <a href="inventor">inventor</a>, and <a href="astronomy">astronomer</a>. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading <a href="scientist">scientist</a>s in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern <a href="calculus">calculus</a> and <a href="mathematical%20analysis">analysis</a> by applying concepts of <a href="infinitesimals">infinitesimals</a> and the <a href="method%20of%20exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a> to derive and rigorously prove a range of <a href="geometry">geometrical</a> <a href="theorem">theorem</a>s, including the <a href="area%20of%20a%20circle">area of a circle</a>, the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> and <a href="volume">volume</a> of a <a href="sphere">sphere</a>, and the area under a <a href="parabola">parabola</a>.

Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of <a href="pi">pi</a>, defining and investigating the <a href="Archimedes%20spiral">spiral</a> bearing his name, and creating a system using <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a> for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding <a href="Fluid%20statics">hydrostatics</a> and <a href="statics">statics</a>, including an explanation of the principle of the <a href="lever">lever</a>. He is credited with designing innovative <a href="machine">machine</a>s, such as his <a href="Archimedes%27%20screw">screw pump</a>, <a href="block%20and%20tackle">compound pulleys</a>, and defensive war machines to protect his native <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> from invasion.

Archimedes died during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Syracuse%20%28213%E2%80%93212%20BC%29">Siege of Syracuse</a> when he was killed by a <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a>, which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.

Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until by <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a> in <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <a href="Eutocius%20of%20Ascalon">Eutocius</a> in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <a href="Archimedes%20Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.

Archimedes was born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, at that time a self-governing <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">colony</a> in <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a>, located along the coast of <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a>. The date of birth is based on a statement by the <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantine Greek</a> historian <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a> that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>", Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> about whom nothing else is known. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> wrote in his "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>" that Archimedes was related to King <a href="Hiero%20II%20of%20Syracuse">Hiero II</a>, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, where <a href="Conon%20of%20Samos">Conon of Samos</a> and <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works ("<a href="Archimedes%27%20use%20of%20infinitesimals">The Method of Mechanical Theorems</a>" and the "<a href="Archimedes%27%20cattle%20problem">Cattle Problem</a>") have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.

Archimedes died c. 212 BC during the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>, when Roman forces under General <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long <a href="siege">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Archimedes was contemplating a <a href="mathematical%20diagram">mathematical diagram</a> when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he must not be harmed. Marcellus called Archimedes "a geometrical <a href="Hekatonkheires%23Hesiod">Briareus</a>".

The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as ""<a href="Noli%20turbare%20circulos%20meos">Noli turbare circulos meos</a>"," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch. <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a>, writing in "Memorable Doings and Sayings" in the 1st century AD, gives the phrase as ""...sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare"'" – "... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this. The phrase is also given in <a href="Katharevousa%20Greek">Katharevousa Greek</a> as "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε!" ("Mē mou tous kuklous taratte!").

The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <a href="orator">orator</a> <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> was serving as <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.

The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> in his "<a href="The%20Histories%20%28Polybius%29">The Histories</a>" was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <a href="Livy">Livy</a>. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.

The most widely known <a href="anecdote">anecdote</a> about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>, a <a href="votive%20crown">votive crown</a> for a temple had been made for <a href="Hiero%20II%20of%20Syracuse">King Hiero II of Syracuse</a>, who had supplied the pure <a href="gold">gold</a> to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some <a href="silver">silver</a> had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its <a href="density">density</a>.
While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a href="volume">volume</a> of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "<a href="Eureka%20%28word%29">Eureka</a>!" (, "heúrēka"!", meaning "I have found [it]!"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.

The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in <a href="fluid%20statics">hydrostatics</a> as <a href="Archimedes%27%20principle">Archimedes' principle</a>, which he describes in his treatise "On Floating Bodies". This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a <a href="buoyancy">buoyant force</a> equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." In a 12th-century text titled "Mappae clavicula" there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem "Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris" of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.

A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a> described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the "<a href="Syracusia">Syracusia</a>", which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The "Syracusia" is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity. According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> and a temple dedicated to the goddess <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <a href="Archimedes%27%20screw">Archimedes' screw</a> was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <a href="Hanging%20Gardens%20of%20Babylon">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>. The world's first seagoing <a href="steamboat">steamship</a> with a <a href="propeller">screw propeller</a> was the <a href="SS%20Archimedes">SS "Archimedes"</a>, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.

The <a href="Claw%20of%20Archimedes">Claw of Archimedes</a> is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker", the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled "Superweapons of the Ancient World" built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.

Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a <a href="parabolic%20reflector">parabolic reflector</a> to burn ships attacking <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>.
The 2nd century AD author <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a> wrote that during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Syracuse%20%28213%E2%80%93212%20BC%29">Siege of Syracuse</a> (c. 214–212 BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, <a href="Anthemius%20of%20Tralles">Anthemius of Tralles</a> mentions <a href="burning-glass">burning-glass</a>es as Archimedes' weapon. The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a <a href="heliostat">heliostat</a> or <a href="solar%20furnace">solar furnace</a>.

This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes. It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <a href="bronze">bronze</a> or <a href="copper">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship.

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <a href="Skaramagas">Skaramagas</a> naval base outside <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of <a href="bitumen">tar</a> paint, which may have aided combustion. A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.

In October 2005 a group of students from the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30 cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a wooden ship at a range of around 100 feet (30 m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show "<a href="MythBusters">MythBusters</a>", using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <a href="autoignition%20temperature">autoignition temperature</a>, which is around 300 °C (570 °F).

When "MythBusters" broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. "MythBusters" also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.

In December 2010, "MythBusters" again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled "President's Challenge". Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a of a Roman sailing ship 400 feet (120 m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 °C (410 °F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, <a href="Glare%20%28vision%29">dazzling</a>, or distracting the crew of the ship.

While Archimedes did not invent the <a href="lever">lever</a>, he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work "On the Equilibrium of Planes". Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a> of the followers of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and are sometimes attributed to <a href="Archytas">Archytas</a>. According to <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a>, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." () Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <a href="block%20and%20tackle">block-and-tackle</a> <a href="pulley">pulley</a> systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <a href="lever">lever</a>age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <a href="catapult">catapult</a>, and with inventing the <a href="odometer">odometer</a> during the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a>. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> "<a href="De%20re%20publica">De re publica</a>", which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse c. 212 BC, General <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="Thales">Thales of Miletus</a> and <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <a href="Gaius%20Sulpicius%20Gallus">Gaius Sulpicius Gallus</a> to <a href="Lucius%20Furius%20Philus">Lucius Furius Philus</a>, who described it thus:

This is a description of a <a href="planetarium">planetarium</a> or <a href="orrery">orrery</a>. <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled . Modern research in this area has been focused on the <a href="Antikythera%20mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, another device built  BC that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <a href="Differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">differential gearing</a>. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.

While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> wrote: "He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life."
Archimedes was able to use <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s in a way that is similar to modern <a href="Integral">integral calculus</a>. Through proof by contradiction (<a href="reductio%20ad%20absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <a href="method%20of%20exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In "<a href="Measurement%20of%20a%20Circle">Measurement of a Circle</a>" he did this by drawing a larger <a href="regular%20hexagon">regular hexagon</a> outside a <a href="circle">circle</a> and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the <a href="area">area</a> of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the <a href="square">square</a> of the <a href="radius">radius</a> of the circle (πr). In "<a href="On%20the%20Sphere%20and%20Cylinder">On the Sphere and Cylinder</a>", Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a> of real numbers.
In "Measurement of a Circle", Archimedes gives the value of the <a href="square%20root">square root</a> of 3 as lying between (approximately 1.7320261) and (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused <a href="John%20Wallis">John Wallis</a> to remark that he was: "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results." It is possible that he used an <a href="iteration">iterative</a> procedure to calculate these values.

In "<a href="The%20Quadrature%20of%20the%20Parabola">The Quadrature of the Parabola</a>", Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a <a href="parabola">parabola</a> and a straight line is times the area of a corresponding inscribed <a href="triangle">triangle</a> as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29%23History%20of%20the%20theory%20of%20infinite%20series">infinite</a> <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a> with the <a href="Geometric%20series%23Common%20ratio">common ratio</a> :

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller <a href="secant%20line">secant line</a>s, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series which sums to .

In "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>", Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of <a href="Hiero%20II%20of%20Syracuse">Hiero II</a>), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the <a href="myriad">myriad</a>. The word is from the Greek "murias", for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 <a href="Names%20of%20large%20numbers">vigintillion</a>, or 8.

The works of Archimedes were written in <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric Greek</a>, the dialect of ancient <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>. The written work of Archimedes has not survived as well as that of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>, and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them by other authors. <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> mentions "<a href="On%20Sphere-Making">On Sphere-Making</a>" and another work on <a href="polyhedron">polyhedra</a>, while <a href="Theon%20of%20Alexandria">Theon of Alexandria</a> quotes a remark about <a href="refraction">refraction</a> from the "Catoptrica". During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> Greek architect <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a> (c. 530 AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <a href="Eutocius%20of%20Ascalon">Eutocius</a> in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by <a href="Th%C4%81bit%20ibn%20Qurra">Thābit ibn Qurra</a> (836–901 AD), and Latin by <a href="Gerard%20of%20Cremona">Gerard of Cremona</a> (c. 1114–1187 AD). During the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, the "Editio Princeps" (First Edition) was published in <a href="Basel">Basel</a> in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin. Around the year 1586 <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.





Archimedes' "<a href="Book%20of%20Lemmas">Book of Lemmas</a>" or "Liber Assumptorum" is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. The scholars <a href="T.L.%20Heath">T.L. Heath</a> and <a href="Marshall%20Clagett">Marshall Clagett</a> argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The "Lemmas" may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.

It has also been claimed that <a href="Heron%27s%20formula">Heron's formula</a> for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes. However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by <a href="Hero%20of%20Alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</a> in the 1st century AD.

The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the <a href="Archimedes%20Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a>. In 1906, the Danish professor <a href="Johan%20Ludvig%20Heiberg%20%28historian%29">Johan Ludvig Heiberg</a> visited <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a <a href="palimpsest">palimpsest</a>, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as <a href="vellum">vellum</a> was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of "On Floating Bodies" in the original Greek. It is the only known source of "The Method of Mechanical Theorems", referred to by <a href="Suda">Suidas</a> and thought to have been lost forever. "Stomachion" was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the <a href="Walters%20Art%20Museum">Walters Art Museum</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> and <a href="light">light</a> to read the overwritten text.

The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest are:



a. In the preface to "On Spirals" addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes says that "many years have elapsed since Conon's death." <a href="Conon%20of%20Samos">Conon of Samos</a> lived , suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.

b. The treatises by Archimedes known to exist only through references in the works of other authors are: "<a href="On%20Sphere-Making">On Sphere-Making</a>" and a work on polyhedra mentioned by Pappus of Alexandria; "Catoptrica", a work on optics mentioned by <a href="Theon%20of%20Alexandria">Theon of Alexandria</a>; "Principles", addressed to Zeuxippus and explaining the number system used in "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>"; "On Balances and Levers"; "On Centers of Gravity"; "On the Calendar". Of the surviving works by Archimedes, <a href="T.L.%20Heath">T.L. Heath</a> offers the following suggestion as to the order in which they were written: "On the Equilibrium of Planes I", "The Quadrature of the Parabola", "On the Equilibrium of Planes II", "On the Sphere and the Cylinder I, II", "On Spirals", "On Conoids and Spheroids", "On Floating Bodies I, II", "On the Measurement of a Circle", "The Sand Reckoner".

c. <a href="Carl%20Benjamin%20Boyer">Boyer, Carl Benjamin</a> "A History of Mathematics" (1991) "Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron's formula — "k" = , where "s" is the semiperimeter — was known to Archimedes several centuries before Heron lived. Arabic scholars also attribute to Archimedes the 'theorem on the broken <a href="chord%20%28geometry%29">chord</a>' ... Archimedes is reported by the Arabs to have given several proofs of the theorem."

d. "It was usual to smear the seams or even the whole hull with pitch or with pitch and wax". In Νεκρικοὶ Διάλογοι ("Dialogues of the Dead"), <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a> refers to coating the seams of a <a href="skiff">skiff</a> with wax, a reference to pitch (tar) or wax.

Apus

Apus is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern sky</a>. It represents a <a href="bird-of-paradise">bird-of-paradise</a>, and its name means "without feet" in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in his 1603 "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted and gave the brighter stars their <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756.

The five brightest stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 3.8 is <a href="Alpha%20Apodis">Alpha Apodis</a>, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of the Sun. Marginally fainter is <a href="Gamma%20Apodis">Gamma Apodis</a>, another ageing giant star. <a href="Delta%20Apodis">Delta Apodis</a> is a <a href="double%20star">double star</a>, the two components of which are 103 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a> apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have been found to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>.

Apus was one of twelve constellations created by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a> who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1603 under the Dutch name "De Paradijs Voghel", "The Bird of Paradise", and Plancius called the constellation "Paradysvogel Apis Indica"; the first word is <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> for "bird of paradise". "Apis" (Latin for "bee") is assumed to have been a typographical error for "avis" ("bird").

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. Bayer called it "Apis Indica" while fellow astronomers <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> and his son-in-law <a href="Jakob%20Bartsch">Jakob Bartsch</a> called it "Apus" or "Avis Indica". The name "Apus" is derived from the Greek "apous", meaning "without feet". This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed. Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>'s <a href="Timeline%20of%20the%20Magellan%E2%80%93Elcano%20circumnavigation">expedition</a> brought them home. The constellation later lost some of its tail when <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> used those stars to establish <a href="Octans">Octans</a> in the 1750s.

Covering 206.3 square degrees and hence 0.5002% of the sky, Apus ranks 67th of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole <a href="constellation">constellation</a> is visible to observers south of <a href="7th%20parallel%20north">7°N</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Ara%20%28constellation%29">Ara</a>, <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a> and <a href="Circinus">Circinus</a> to the north, <a href="Musca">Musca</a> and <a href="Chamaeleon">Chamaeleon</a> to the west, Octans to the south, and <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Aps'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −67.48° and −83.12°.

Lacaille gave twelve stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s, labelling them Alpha through to Kappa, including two stars next to each other as Delta and another two stars near each other as Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5. <a href="Beta%20Apodis">Beta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Apodis">Gamma</a> and <a href="Delta%20Apodis">Delta Apodis</a> form a narrow triangle, with <a href="Alpha%20Apodis">Alpha Apodis</a> lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.

Alpha Apodis is an <a href="giant%20star">orange giant</a> of spectral type K3III located 430 ± 20 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8.

Apollo 15

Apollo 15 was the ninth manned mission in the United States' <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>, the eighth to be successful, and the fourth to <a href="Moon%20landing">land on the Moon</a>. It was the first <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">J mission</a>, with a longer stay on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> and a greater focus on science than earlier landings. Apollo 15 saw the first use of the <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a>.

The mission began on July 26, 1971, and ended on August 7, the lunar surface exploration taking place between July 30 and August 2. <a href="Apollo%20Commander">Commander</a> <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> and <a href="Lunar%20Module%20Pilot">Lunar Module Pilot</a> <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a> landed near <a href="Hadley%20Rille">Hadley Rille</a> and explored the local area using the rover, allowing them to travel further from the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">lunar module</a> than had been possible on previous missions. They spent 18 hours on the Moon's surface on <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA), and collected of surface material.

At the same time, <a href="Command%20Module%20Pilot">Command Module Pilot</a> <a href="Alfred%20Worden">Alfred Worden</a> orbited the Moon, operating the sensors in the <a href="scientific%20instrument%20module">SIM</a> bay of the <a href="Apollo%20service%20module">service module</a>. This suite of instruments collected data on the Moon and its environment using a panoramic camera, a <a href="gamma-ray%20spectrometer">gamma-ray spectrometer</a>, a mapping camera, a laser <a href="altimeter">altimeter</a>, a <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a>, and a lunar subsatellite deployed at the end of Apollo 15's stay in <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a>. On the journey home, Worden performed the first <a href="spacewalk">spacewalk</a> in deep space, and the mission splashed down safely despite the loss of one of its three parachutes.

The mission accomplished its goals but was marred by negative publicity the following year when it emerged that <a href="Apollo%2015%20postal%20covers%20incident">the crew had carried unauthorized postal covers</a> to the lunar surface, some of which were sold by a West German stamp dealer. The members of the crew were reprimanded for poor judgment, and did not fly in space again. Apollo 15 is also remembered for the finding of the <a href="Genesis%20Rock">Genesis Rock</a>, and for Scott's use of a hammer and a feather to validate <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s theory that absent air resistance, objects drop at the same rate.

In 1962, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> contracted for fifteen <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rockets to achieve the Apollo program's goal of a manned landing on the Moon by 1970; at the time no one knew how many missions this would require. Since success was obtained in 1969 with the sixth Saturn V on <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>, nine rockets remained available for a hoped-for <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions%23Follow-on%20lunar%20missions">total of ten landings</a>. These plans included a heavier, extended version of the <a href="Apollo%20spacecraft">Apollo spacecraft</a> to be used in the last five missions (Apollo 16 through 20). The revamped lunar module would be capable of up to a 75-hour stay, and would carry a <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> to the Moon's surface. The service module would house a package of orbital experiments to gather data on the Moon. In the original plan, Apollo 15 was to be the last of the non-extended missions, to land in <a href="Censorinus%20%28crater%29">Censorinus crater</a>. But in anticipation of budget cuts, NASA cancelled the last three landing missions by September 1970. Apollo 15 became the first of three extended missions, known as J missions, and the landing site was moved to <a href="Hadley%20Rille">Hadley Rille</a>, originally planned for <a href="Apollo%2019">Apollo 19</a>.

Scott was born in 1932 in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, and had graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1954. Serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>, Scott had received two advanced degrees from <a href="MIT">MIT</a> in 1962 before being selected as one of the <a href="List%20of%20astronauts%20by%20year%20of%20selection%231963">third group of astronauts</a> the following year. He flew in <a href="Gemini%208">Gemini 8</a> in 1966 alongside <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and as command module pilot of <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a> in 1969. Worden was born in 1932 in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson, Michigan</a>, and like his commander, had attended West Point (class of 1955) and served in the Air Force. Worden earned two master's degrees in engineering from the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> in 1963. Irwin had been born in 1930 in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, and had attended the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, graduating in 1951 and serving in the Air Force, receiving a master's degree from Michigan in 1957. Both Worden and Irwin were selected in the <a href="List%20of%20astronauts%20by%20year%20of%20selection%231966">fifth group of astronauts</a> (1966), and Apollo 15 would be their only spaceflight.

The backup crew was <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Richard F. Gordon Jr.</a> as commander, <a href="Vance%20D.%20Brand">Vance D. Brand</a> as command module pilot and <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison H. Schmitt</a> as lunar module pilot. By the usual rotation of crews, the three would most likely have flown <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions">Apollo 18</a>, which was canceled. Brand flew later on the <a href="Apollo-Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a> and on <a href="STS-5">STS-5</a>, the first operational <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> mission. With NASA under intense pressure to send a professional scientist to the Moon, Schmitt, a geologist, was selected as LMP of <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a> in preference to <a href="Joe%20Engle">Joe Engle</a>.
Apollo 15's support crew consisted of astronauts <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Allen">Joseph P. Allen</a>, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Parker">Robert A. Parker</a> and <a href="Karl%20Gordon%20Henize">Karl G. Henize</a>. All three were scientist-astronauts, <a href="List%20of%20astronauts%20by%20selection%231967">selected in 1967</a>, as the prime crew felt they needed more assistance with the science than with the piloting. None of the support crew would fly during the Apollo program, waiting until the Space Shuttle program to go into space.

The flight controllers for Apollo 15 were as follows:


During a mission the <a href="Flight%20controller%23CAPCOM">capsule communicators</a> (CAPCOMs), always fellow astronauts, were the only people who normally would speak to the crew. For Apollo 15, the CAPCOMs were Allen, Brand, <a href="C.%20Gordon%20Fullerton">C. Gordon Fullerton</a>, Gordon, Henize, <a href="Edgar%20D.%20Mitchell">Edgar D. Mitchell</a>, Parker, Schmitt and <a href="Alan%20B.%20Shepard">Alan B. Shepard</a>.

Schmitt and other scientist-astronauts advocated for a greater place for science on the early Apollo missions. They were often met with disinterest from other astronauts, or found science displaced by higher priorities. Schmitt realized that what was needed was an expert teacher who could fire the astronauts' enthusiasm, and contacted <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> geologist <a href="Leon%20Silver">Lee Silver</a>, whom Schmitt introduced to <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a>'s commander, <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, and to its lunar module pilot, <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a>, then in training for their mission. Lovell and Haise were willing to go on a field expedition with Silver, and geology became a significant part of their training. Geologist <a href="Farouk%20El-Baz">Farouk El-Baz</a> trained the prime crew's command module pilot, <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a> to inform his planned observations from lunar orbit. The crew's newly-acquired skills mostly went unused, due to the explosion that damaged the Apollo 13 spacecraft, and caused an abort of the mission. Apollo 14's CMP, <a href="Stu%20Roosa">Stu Roosa</a>, was enthusiastic about geology, but the mission commander, Shepard, less so.
Already familiar with the spacecraft as the backup crew for Apollo 12, Scott, Worden and Irwin could devote more of their training time as prime crew for Apollo 15 to geology and sampling techniques. Scott was determined that his crew bring back the maximum amount of scientific data possible, and met with Silver in April 1970 to begin planning the geological training. Schmitt's assignment as Apollo 15's backup LMP made him an insider, and allowed him to spark competition between the prime and backup crews. The cancellation of two Apollo missions in September 1970 transformed Apollo 15 into a J mission, with a longer stay on the lunar surface, and the first <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> (LRV). This change was welcomed by Scott, who according to David West Reynolds in his account of the Apollo Program, was "something more than a hotshot pilot. Scott had the spirit of a true explorer", one determined to get the most from the J mission. The additional need for communications, including from planned experiments and the rover, required the near-rebuilding of the <a href="Honeysuckle%20Creek%20Tracking%20Station">Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station</a> in Australia.
Geology field trips took place about once a month throughout the crew's 20 months of training. At first Silver would take the commanders and LMPs from the prime and backup crews to geological sites in Arizona and New Mexico as if for a normal field geology lesson, but closer to launch, these trips became more realistic. Crews began to wear mock-ups of the backpacks they would carry, and communicate using <a href="walkie-talkie">walkie-talkie</a>s to a CAPCOM in a tent. The CAPCOM was accompanied by a geologist unfamiliar with the area who would rely on the astronauts' descriptions to interpret the findings, and familiarized the crew members with describing landscapes to people who could not see them. Considering himself a serious amateur, Scott came to enjoy field geology.

The decision to land at Hadley came in September 1970. The Site Selection Committee had narrowed the field down to two sites — Hadley Rille, a deep channel on the edge of <a href="Mare%20Imbrium">Mare Imbrium</a> close to the <a href="Montes%20Apenninus">Apennine mountains</a> or the crater <a href="Marius%20%28crater%29">Marius</a>, near which were a <a href="Marius%20Hills">group of low, possibly volcanic, domes</a>. Although not ultimately his decision, the commander of a mission always held great sway. To David Scott the choice was clear, as Hadley "had more variety. There is a certain intangible quality which drives the spirit of exploration and I felt that Hadley had it. Besides it looked beautiful and usually when things look good they are good." The selection of Hadley was made although NASA lacked high resolution images of the landing site; none had been made as the site was considered too rough to risk one of the earlier Apollo missions. The proximity of the Apennine mountains to the Hadley site required a landing approach trajectory of 26 degrees, far steeper than the 15 degrees in earlier Apollo landings.

The expanded mission meant that Worden spent much of his time at <a href="Rockwell%20International">North American Rockwell</a>'s facilities at <a href="Downey%2C%20California">Downey, California</a>, where the command and service module (CSM) was being built. He undertook a different kind of geology training. Working with El-Baz, he studied maps and photographs of the craters he would pass over while orbiting alone in the CSM. As El-Baz listened and gave feedback, Worden learned how to describe lunar features in a way that would be useful to the scientists who would listen to his transmissions back on Earth. Worden found El-Baz to be an enjoyable and inspiring teacher. Worden usually accompanied his crewmates on their geology field trips, though he was often in an airplane overhead, describing features of the landscape as the plane simulated the speed at which the lunar landscape would pass below the CSM.

The demands of the training strained Worden's marriage and also that of Irwin; each sought Scott's advice, fearing that divorce might endanger their places on the mission as not projecting the image NASA wanted for the astronauts. Scott consulted Director of Flight Crew Operations <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, their boss, who stated what was important was that the astronauts do their jobs. Although the Irwins overcame their marital difficulties, Worden divorced before the mission.

Apollo 15 used command and service module CSM-112, which was given the <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a> "Endeavour", named after <a href="HMS%20Endeavour">HMS "Endeavour"</a>, and lunar module LM-10, call sign "Falcon", named after the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a> mascot. Scott explained the choice of the name "Endeavour" on the grounds that its captain, <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> had commanded the first purely scientific sea voyage, and Apollo 15 was the first lunar landing mission on which there was a heavy emphasis on science. Apollo 15 took with it a small piece of wood from Cook's ship while "Falcon" carried two falcon feathers to the Moon in recognition of the crew's service in the Air Force.
Technicians at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> had some problems with the instruments in the service module's scientific instrument module (<a href="scientific%20instrument%20module">SIM</a>) bay. Some instruments were late in arriving, and principal investigators or representatives of NASA contractors sought further testing or to make small changes. Mechanical problems came from the fact the instruments were designed to operate in space, but had to be tested on the surface of the Earth. As such, things like the 7.5 m (24 ft) booms for the <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass</a> and <a href="gamma%20ray%20spectrometer">gamma ray spectrometer</a>s could only be tested using equipment that tried to mimic the space environment, and, in space, the mass spectrometer boom several times did not fully retract.

On the lunar module, the <a href="fuel">fuel</a> and <a href="oxidizer">oxidizer</a> tanks were enlarged on both the descent and ascent stages and the <a href="Rocket%20engine%20nozzle">engine bell</a> on the descent stage was extended. Batteries and <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s were added for increased electrical power. In all this increased the weight of the lunar module to , heavier than previous models.

If Apollo 15 had flown as an H mission, it would have been with CSM-111 and LM-9. That CSM was used by the <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz Test Project</a> in 1975, but the lunar module went unused and is now at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Visitor%20Complex">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</a>. "Endeavour" is on display at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>.

The <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> that launched Apollo 15 was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready model of the rocket. As the payload of the rocket was greater, changes were made to the rocket and to its launch trajectory. It was launched in a more southerly direction (80–100 degrees <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a>) than that of previous missions, and the Earth <a href="parking%20orbit">parking orbit</a> was lowered to . These two changes meant more could be launched. The <a href="propellant">propellant</a> reserves were reduced and the number of retrorockets on the <a href="S-IC">S-IC</a> first stage (used to separate the spent first stage from the <a href="S-II">S-II</a> second stage) reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer. Changes were also made to the S-II to dampen <a href="pogo%20oscillation">pogo oscillation</a>s.

Once all major systems were installed in the Saturn V, it was moved from the <a href="Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building">Vehicle Assembly Building</a> to the launch site, <a href="Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a>A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) were struck by <a href="lightning">lightning</a> at least four times. There was no damage to the vehicle, and only minor damage to ground support equipment.

The Apollo 15 astronauts wore redesigned <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a>s. On all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar flights, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling, and communications connections in two parallel rows of three. On Apollo 15, the new suits, dubbed the "<a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L%23A7LB%20Spacesuit%20%28Apollo%2C%20Skylab%20and%20ASTP%29">A7LB</a>", had the connectors situated in triangular pairs. This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), from the right shoulder to the left hip, aided in suiting and unseating in the cramped confines of the spacecraft. It also allowed for a new waist joint, letting the astronauts bend completely over, and also sit on the rover. Upgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks. As in all missions from and after Apollo 13, the commander's suit bore a red stripe on the helmet, arms and legs.

Worden wore a suit similar to those worn by the Apollo 14 astronauts, but modified to interface with Apollo 15's equipment. Gear only needed for lunar surface EVAs, such as the liquid cooling garment, was not included with Worden's suit, as the only EVA he was expected to do was one to retrieve film cartridges from the SIM bay on the flight home.

A vehicle that could operate on the surface of the Moon had been considered by NASA since the early 1960s. An early version was called MOLAB, which had a closed cabin and would have massed about ; some scaled-down prototypes were tested in Arizona. As it became clear NASA would not soon establish a lunar base, such a large vehicle seemed unnecessary. Still, a rover would enhance the J missions, which were to concentrate on science, though its mass was limited to about and it was not then clear that so light a vehicle could be useful. NASA did not decide to proceed with a rover until May 1969, as <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>, the dress rehearsal for the Moon landing, made its way home from lunar orbit. <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> got the contract for three rovers on a <a href="cost-plus%20contract">cost plus basis</a>; overruns (especially in the navigation system) meant that the three vehicles eventually cost a total of $40 million. These cost overruns gained considerable media attention at a time of greater public weariness with the space program, when NASA's budget was being cut.

The Lunar Roving Vehicle could be folded into a space 5 ft by 20 in (1.5 m by 0.5 m). Unloaded, it weighed 460 lb (209 kg) and when carrying two astronauts and their equipment, 1500 lb (700 kg). Each wheel was independently driven by a ¼ <a href="horsepower">horsepower</a> (200 W) electric motor. Although it could be driven by either astronaut, the commander always drove. Travelling at speeds up to 6 to 8 mph (10 to 12 km/h), it meant that for the first time the astronauts could travel far afield from their lander and still have enough time to do some scientific experiments. During pre-launch testing, the LRV was given additional bracing, lest it collapse if someone sat on it under Earth conditions.

The Apollo 15 Particles and Fields Subsatellite (PFS-1) was a small satellite released into lunar orbit from the SIM bay just before the mission left orbit to return to Earth. Its main objectives were to study the plasma, particle, and magnetic field environment of the Moon and map the lunar gravity field. Specifically, it measured plasma and energetic particle intensities and vector magnetic fields, and facilitated tracking of the satellite velocity to high precision. A basic requirement was that the satellite acquire fields and particle data everywhere on the orbit around the Moon. As well as measuring magnetic fields, the satellite contained sensors to study the Moon's <a href="Mass%20concentration%20%28astronomy%29">mass concentrations</a>, or mascons. The satellite orbited the Moon and returned data from August 4, 1971 until January 1973, when, following multiple failures of the subsatellite's electronics, ground support was terminated. It is believed to have crashed into the Moon sometime thereafter.

Apollo 15 was launched on July 26, 1971, at 9:34 AM <a href="Eastern%20time">EDT</a> from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> at <a href="Merritt%20Island">Merritt Island</a>, Florida. The time of launch was at the very start of the two-hour, 37 minute launch window, which would allow Apollo 15 to arrive at the Moon with the proper lighting conditions at Hadley Rille; had the mission been postponed beyond another window on July 27, it could not have been rescheduled until late August. The astronauts had been wakened five and a quarter hours before launch by Slayton, and after breakfast and suiting up, had been taken to Pad 39A, launch site of all seven attempts at manned lunar landing, and entered the spacecraft about three hours before launch. There were no unplanned delays in the countdown.

At 000:11:36 into the mission, the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> engine shut down, leaving Apollo 15 in its planned parking orbit in <a href="Low%20Earth%20Orbit">Low Earth Orbit</a>. The mission remained there for some 2 hours and 40 minutes, allowing the crew (and Houston, via telemetry) to check the spacecraft's systems. At 002:50.02.6 into the mission, the S-IVB was restarted for <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a> (TLI), placing the craft on a path to the Moon. Before TLI, the craft had completed 1.5 orbits around the Earth.
The command and service module (CSM) and the lunar module remained attached to the nearly-exhausted S-IVB booster. Once trans-lunar injection had been achieved, placing the spacecraft on a trajectory towards the Moon, <a href="Detonating%20cord">explosive cords</a> separated the CSM from the booster as Worden operated the CSM's thrusters to push it away. Worden then maneuvered the CSM to dock with the LM (mounted on the end of the S-IVB), and the combined craft was then separated from the S-IVB by explosives. After Apollo 15 separated from the booster, the S-IVB maneuvered away, and, as planned, impacted the Moon about an hour after the crewed spacecraft entered lunar orbit, though due to an error the impact was away from the intended target. The booster's impact was detected by the <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a>s left on the Moon by Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, providing useful scientific data.

There was a malfunctioning light on the craft's <a href="service%20propulsion%20system">service propulsion system</a> (SPS); after considerable troubleshooting, the astronauts did a test burn of the system that also served as a midcourse correction. This occurred about 028:40:00 into the mission. Fearing that the light meant the SPS might unexpectedly fire, the astronauts avoided using the control bank that had the faulty light, bringing it online only for major burns, and controlling it manually. After the mission returned, the malfunction proved to be caused by a tiny bit of wire trapped within the switch.
After purging and renewing the LM's atmosphere to eliminate any contamination, the astronauts entered the LM about 34 hours into the mission, needing to check the condition of its equipment and move in items that would be required on the Moon. Much of this work was televised back to Earth, the camera operated by Worden. The crew discovered a broken outer cover on the Range/Range Rate tapemeter. This was a concern not only because an important piece of equipment, providing information on distance and rate of approach, might not work properly, but because bits of the glass cover were floating around "Falcon"'s interior. The tapemeter was supposed to be in a helium atmosphere, but due to the breakage, it was in the LM's oxygen atmosphere. Testing on the ground verified the tapemeter would still work properly, and the crew removed most of the glass using a vacuum cleaner and adhesive tape.

As yet, there had been only minor problems, but at about 61:15:00 mission time (the evening of July 28 in Houston), Scott discovered a leak in the water system while preparing to chlorinate the water supply. The crew could not tell where it was coming from, and the issue had the potential to become serious. The experts in Houston found a solution, which was successfully implemented by the crew. The water was mopped up with towels, which were then put out to dry in the tunnel between the command module (CM) and lunar module—Scott stated it looked like someone's laundry.

At 073:31:14 into the mission, a second midcourse correction, with less than a second of burn, was made. Although there were four opportunities to make midcourse corrections following TLI, only two needed to be used. Apollo 15 approached the Moon on July 29, and the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) burn had to be made using the SPS, on the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a>, out of radio contact with Earth. If no burn occurred, Apollo 15 would emerge from the lunar shadow and come back in radio contact faster than expected; the continued lack of communication allowed <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control</a> to conclude that the burn had taken place. When contact resumed, Scott did not immediately give the particulars of the burn, but spoke admiringly of the beauty of the Moon, causing Alan Shepard, the Apollo 14 commander, who was awaiting a television interview, to grumble, "To hell with that shit, give us details of the burn." The 398.36-second burn took place at 078:31:46.7 into the mission at an altitude of above the Moon, and placed Apollo 15 in an elliptical lunar orbit of .

On Apollo 11 and 12, the lunar module decoupled from the CSM and descended to a much lower orbit from which the lunar landing attempt commenced; to save fuel in an increasingly heavy lander, beginning with Apollo 14, the SPS in the service module made that burn, known as descent orbit insertion (DOI), with the lunar module still attached to the CSM. The initial orbit Apollo 15 was in had its <a href="apocynthion">apocynthion</a>, or high point, over the landing site at Hadley; a burn at the opposite point in the orbit was performed, with the result that Hadley would now be under the craft's <a href="pericynthion">pericynthion</a>, or low point. The DOI burn was performed at 082:39:49.09 and took 24.53 seconds; the result was an orbit with apocynthion of and pericynthion of . Overnight between July 29 and 30, as the crew rested, it became apparent to Mission Control that <a href="Mass%20concentration%20%28astronomy%29">mass concentrations</a> in the Moon were making Apollo 15's orbit increasingly elliptical—pericynthion was by the time the crew was awakened on July 30. This, and uncertainty as to the exact altitude of the landing site, made it desirable that the orbit be modified, or trimmed. Using the craft's <a href="Reaction%20control%20system">RCS</a> thrusters, this took place at 095:56:44.70, lasting 30.40 seconds, and raised the pericynthion to and the apocynthion to .

As well as preparing the lunar module for its descent, the crew continued observations of the Moon (including of the landing site at Hadley) and provided television footage of the surface. Then, Scott and Irwin entered the lunar module in preparation for the landing attempt. Undocking was planned for 100:13:56, over the far side of the Moon, but nothing happened when separation was attempted. After analyzing the problem, the crew and Houston decided the probe instrumentation umbilical was likely loose or disconnected; Worden went into the tunnel connecting the command and lunar modules and determined this was so, seating it more firmly. With the problem resolved, "Falcon" separated from "Endeavour" at 100:39:16.2, about 25 minutes late, at an altitude of . Worden in "Endeavour" executed a SPS burn at 101:38:58.98 to send "Endeavour" to an orbit of by in preparation for his scientific work.

Aboard "Falcon", Scott and Irwin prepared for powered descent initiation (PDI), the burn that was to place them on the lunar surface, and, after Mission Control gave them permission, they initiated PDI at 104:30:09.4 at an altitude of , slightly higher than planned. During the first part of the descent, "Falcon" was aligned so that the astronauts were on their backs and thus could not see the lunar surface below them, but after the craft made a pitchover maneuver, they were upright and could see the surface in front of them. Scott, who as commander performed the landing, was confronted with a landscape that did not at first seem to resemble what he had seen during simulations. Part of this was due to an error in the landing path of some , of which CAPCOM <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Ed Mitchell</a> informed the crew prior to pitchover; part because the craters Scott had relied on in the simulator were difficult to make out under lunar conditions, and he initially could not see Hadley Rille. He concluded that they were likely to overshoot the planned landing site, and, once he could see the rille, started maneuvering the vehicle to move the computer's landing target back towards the planned spot, and looked for a relatively smooth place to land.
Below about , Scott could see nothing of the surface because of the quantities of lunar dust being displaced by "Falcon"'s exhaust. "Falcon" had a larger <a href="Rocket%20engine%20nozzle">engine bell</a> than previous LMs, in part to accommodate a heavier load, and the importance of shutting down the engine at initial contact rather than risk "blowback", the exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface and going back into the engine (possibly causing an explosion) had been impressed on the astronauts by mission planners. Thus, when Irwin called "Contact", indicating that one of the probes on the landing leg extensions had touched the surface, Scott immediately shut off the engine, letting the lander fall the remaining distance to the surface. Already moving downward at about per second, "Falcon" dropped from a height of . Scott's speed resulted in what was likely the hardest lunar landing of any of the manned missions, at about per second, causing a startled Irwin to yell "Bam!" Scott had landed "Falcon" on the rim of a small crater he could not see, and the lander settled back at an angle of 6.9 degrees and to the left of 8.6 degrees. Irwin described it in his autobiography as the hardest landing he had ever been in, and he feared that the craft would keep tipping over, forcing an immediate abort.

"Falcon" landed at 104:42:29.3 (22:16:29 GMT on July 30), with approximately 103 seconds of fuel remaining, about from the planned landing site. After Irwin's exclamation, Scott reported, "Okay, Houston. The "Falcon" is on the Plain at Hadley." Once within the planned landing zone, the increased mobility provided by the Lunar Roving Vehicle made unnecessary any further maneuvering.

With "Falcon" due to remain on the lunar surface for almost three days, Scott deemed it important to maintain the <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian rhythm</a> they were used to, and as they had landed in the late afternoon, Houston time, the two astronauts were to sleep before going onto the surface. But the time schedule allowed Scott to open the lander's top hatch (usually used for docking) and spend a half hour looking at their surroundings, describing them, and taking photographs. Lee Silver had taught him the importance of going to a high place to survey a new field site, and the top hatch served that purpose. Deke Slayton and other managers had initially been in opposition, due to the oxygen that would be lost, but Scott got his way. During the only standup <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (standup EVA) ever performed through the top hatch on the lunar surface, Scott was able to make plans for the following day's EVA. He offered Irwin a chance to look out as well, but this would have required rearranging the umbilicals connecting Irwin to "Falcon"'s life support system, and he declined. After repressurizing the spacecraft, Scott and Irwin removed their space suits for sleep, becoming the first astronauts to doff their suits while on the Moon.
Throughout the sleep period Mission Control in Houston monitored a slow but steady oxygen loss. Scott and Irwin eventually were awakened an hour early, and the source of the problem was found to be an open valve on the urine transfer device. In post-mission debriefing, Scott recommended that future crews be woken at once under similar circumstances. After the problem was solved, the crew began preparation for the first Moon walk.

After donning their suits and depressurizing the cabin, Scott and Irwin began their first full EVA, becoming the seventh and eighth humans, respectively, to walk on the Moon. They attempted to deploy the lunar rover, stored folded up on the outside of "Falcon"'s descent stage, but this proved troublesome due to the slant of the lander. The experts in Houston suggested lifting the front end of the rover as the astronauts pulled it out, and this worked. One of the batteries gave a zero voltage reading, but this proved to be an instrumentation problem. A greater concern was that the front wheel steering would not work, but the rear wheel steering was sufficient to maneuver the vehicle. The rover carried a <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">television camera</a>, controlled remotely from Houston by NASA's Ed Fendell. The resolution was not high compared to the still photographs that would be taken, but the camera allowed the geologists on Earth to indirectly participate in Scott and Irwin's activities.

The rille was not visible from the landing site, but as Scott and Irwin drove over the rolling terrain, it came into view. They were able to see Elbow Crater, and they began to drive in that direction. Reaching Elbow, a known location, allowed Mission Control to backtrack and get closer to pinpointing the location of the lander. The astronauts took samples there, and then drove to another crater on the flank of <a href="Mount%20Hadley%20Delta">Mount Hadley Delta</a>, where they took more. After concluding this stop, they returned to the lander to drop off their samples and prepare to set up the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP), the scientific instruments that would remain when they left. Scott had difficulty drilling the holes required for the heat flow experiment, and the work was not completed when they had to return to the lander. The first EVA lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes.

The rover's front steering, inoperative during the first EVA, worked during the second and third ones. The target of the second EVA, on August 1, was the slope of Mount Hadley Delta, where the pair sampled boulders and craters along the <a href="Montes%20Apenninus">Apennine Front</a>. They spent an hour at Spur Crater, during which the astronauts secured what came to be one of the more famous lunar samples, #15415, more commonly known as the "<a href="Genesis%20Rock">Genesis Rock</a>". This rock, an <a href="anorthosite">anorthosite</a>, is believed to be part of the early lunar crust—the hope of finding such a specimen had been one reason the Hadley area had been chosen. Once back at the landing site, Scott continued to try to drill holes for experiments at the ALSEP site, with which he had struggled the day before. After conducting soil-mechanics experiments and raising the <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">U.S. flag</a>, Scott and Irwin returned to the LM. EVA 2 lasted 7 hours and 12 minutes.

Although Scott had eventually been successful at drilling the holes, he and Irwin had been unable to retrieve a core sample, and this was an early order of business during EVA 3, their third and final moonwalk. Time that could have been devoted to geology ticked away as Scott and Irwin attempted to pull it out. Once it had been retrieved, more time passed as they attempted to break the core into pieces for transport to Earth. Hampered by an incorrectly-mounted vise on the rover, they eventually gave up on this—the core would be transported home with one segment longer than planned. Scott wondered if the core was worth the amount of time and effort invested, and the CAPCOM, Joe Allen, assured him that it was. The core proved one of the most important items brought back from the Moon, revealing much about its history, but the expended time meant the planned visit to a group of hills known as the <a href="North%20Complex">North Complex</a> had to be scrubbed. Instead, the crew again ventured to the edge of Hadley Rille, this time to the northwest of the immediate landing site.
Once the astronauts were beside the LM, Scott used a kit provided by the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">Postal Service</a> to cancel a <a href="first%20day%20cover">first day cover</a> of two stamps being issued on August 2, the current date. Scott then performed an experiment in view of the television camera, using a feather and hammer to demonstrate <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s theory that all objects in a given gravity field fall at the same rate, regardless of mass, in the absence of <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a>. He dropped the hammer and feather at the same time; because of the negligible lunar atmosphere, there was no drag on the feather, which hit the ground at the same time as the hammer. This was Joe Allen's idea (he also served as CAPCOM during it) and was part of an effort to find a memorable popular science experiment to do on the Moon along the lines of Shepard's hitting of golf balls. The feather was from a falcon, a mascot at the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a>.
Scott then drove the rover to a position away from the LM, where the television camera could be used to observe the lunar liftoff. Near the rover, he left a small aluminum statuette called "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>", along with a plaque bearing the names of 14 known American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who had died in the furtherance of space exploration. The memorial was left while the television camera was turned away; he told Mission Control he was doing some cleanup activities around the rover. Scott disclosed the memorial in a post-flight news conference. He also placed a Bible on the control panel of the rover before leaving it for the last time to enter the LM.

The EVA lasted 4 hours, 49 minutes and 50 seconds. In total, the two astronauts spent 18 hours outside the LM and collected approximately of lunar samples.

After the departure of "Falcon", Worden in "Endeavour" executed a burn to take the CSM to a higher orbit. While "Falcon" was on the Moon, the mission effectively split, Worden and the CSM being assigned their own CAPCOM and flight support team.
Worden got busy with the tasks that were to occupy him for much of the time he spent in space alone: photography and operating the instruments in the SIM bay. The door to the SIM bay had been explosively jettisoned during the translunar coast. Filling previously-unused space in the service module, the SIM bay contained a gamma-ray spectrometer, mounted on the end of a boom, an X-ray spectrometer and a laser altimeter, which failed part way through the mission. Two cameras, a stellar camera and a metric camera, together comprised the mapping camera, which was complimented by a panoramic camera, derived from <a href="Corona%20%28satellite%29">spy technology</a>. The altimeter and cameras permitted the exact time and location from which pictures were taken to be determined. Also present were an alpha particle spectrometer, which could be used to detect evidence of lunar volcanism, and a mass spectrometer, also on a boom in the hope it would be unaffected by contamination from the ship. The boom would prove troublesome, as Worden would not always be able to get it to retract.
"Endeavour" was slated to pass over the landing site at the moment of planned landing, but Worden could not see "Falcon" and did not spot it until a subsequent orbit. He also exercised to avoid muscle atrophy, and Houston kept him up to date on Scott and Irwin's activities on the lunar surface. The panoramic camera did not operate perfectly, but provided enough images that no special adjustment was made. Worden took many photographs through the command module's windows, often with shots taken at regular intervals. His task was complicated by the lack of a working mission timer in the Lower Equipment Bay of the command module, as its circuit breaker had popped en route to the Moon. Worden's observations and photographs would inform the decision to send <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a> to <a href="Taurus-Littrow">Taurus-Littrow</a> to search for evidence of volcanic activity. There was a communications blackout when the CSM passed over the far side of the Moon from Earth; Worden greeted each resumption of contact with the words, "Hello, Earth. Greetings from "Endeavour"", expressed in different languages. Worden and El-Baz had come up with the idea, and the geology instructor had aided the astronaut in accumulating translations. 

Results from the SIM bay experiments would include the conclusion, from data gathered by the X-ray spectrometer that there was greater fluorescent X-ray flux than anticipated, and that the lunar highlands were richer in aluminum than were the mares. "Endeavour" was in a more inclined orbit than previous manned missions, and Worden saw features that were not known previously, supplementing photographs with thorough descriptions.

By the time Scott and Irwin were ready to take off from the lunar surface and return to "Endeavor", the CSM's orbit had drifted due to the rotation of the Moon, and a plane change burn was required to ensure that the CSM's orbit would be in the same plane as that of the LM once it took off from the Moon. Worden accomplished the 18-second burn with the SPS.

"Falcon" lifted off the Moon at 17:11:22 GMT on August 2 after 66 hours and 55 minutes on the lunar surface. Docking with the CSM took place just under two hours later. After the astronauts transferred samples and other items from the LM to the CSM, the LM was sealed off, jettisoned, and intentionally crashed into the lunar surface, an impact registered by the seismometers left by Apollo 12, 14 and 15. The jettison proved difficult because of problems getting airtight seals, requiring a delay in discarding the LM. After the jettison, Slayton came on the loop to recommend that the astronauts take sleeping pills, or at least that Scott and Irwin do so. Scott as mission commander refused to allow it, feeling there was no need. During the EVAs, the doctors had noticed irregularities in the heartbeats of both Scott and Irwin, of which the crew was not informed during the flight. Irwin had heart problems after retiring as an astronaut and died in 1991 of a heart attack; Scott felt that he as commander should have been informed of the biomedical readings. NASA doctors at the time theorized the heart readings were due to <a href="hypokalemia">potassium deficiency</a>, due to their hard work on the surface and inadequate resupply through liquids.
The crew spent the next two days working on orbital science experiments, including more observations of the Moon from orbit and releasing the subsatellite. The three-person crew departed lunar orbit with another burn of the SPS engine of 2 minutes 21 seconds at 21:22:45 GMT on August 4. The next day, on the return trip to Earth, Worden performed a spacewalk in deep space, the first of its kind, to retrieve exposed film from the SIM bay. Later on in the day, the crew set a record for the longest Apollo flight to that point.

On approach to Earth on August 7, the service module was jettisoned, and the command module <a href="Atmospheric%20reentry">reentered the Earth's atmosphere</a>. Although one of the three parachutes on the CM failed to deploy properly, likely due to damage as the spacecraft vented fuel, only two were required for a safe landing (one extra for redundancy). Upon landing in the North Pacific Ocean, the CM and crew were recovered and taken aboard the recovery ship, , after a mission lasting 12 days, 7 hours, 11 minutes and 53 seconds.

The mission objectives for Apollo 15 were to "perform selenological inspection, survey, and sampling of materials and surface features in a pre-selected area of the Hadley-Appenine region. Emplace and activate surface experiments. Evaluate the capability of the Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time, increased extravehicular operations, and surface mobility. [and] Conduct inflight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit." It achieved all those objectives. The mission also completed a long list of other tasks, including experiments. One of the photographic objectives, to obtain images of the <a href="gegenschein">gegenschein</a> from lunar orbit, was not completed, as the camera was not pointed at the proper spot in the sky. According to the conclusions in the "Apollo 15 Mission Report", the journey "was the fourth lunar landing and resulted in the collection of a wealth of scientific information. The Apollo system, in addition to providing a means of transportation, excelled as an operational scientific facility."

According to David Woods in the "Apollo Lunar Flight Journal",
Despite the successful mission, the careers of the crew were tarnished by a deal they had made before the flight to carry postal covers to the Moon in exchange for about $7,000 each, which they planned to set aside for their children. Walter Eiermann, who had many professional and social contacts with NASA employees and the astronaut corps, served as intermediary between the astronauts and a West German stamp dealer, Hermann Sieger, and Scott carried about 400 covers onto the spacecraft; they were subsequently transferred into "Falcon" and remained inside the lander during the astronauts' activities on the surface of the Moon. After the return to Earth, 100 of the covers were given to Eiermann, who passed them on to Sieger, receiving a commission. No permission had been received from Slayton to carry the covers, as required.

The 100 covers were put on sale to Sieger's customers in late 1971 at a price of about $1,500 each. After receiving the agreed payments, the astronauts returned them, and accepted no compensation. In April 1972, Slayton learned that unauthorized covers had been carried, and removed the three as the backup crew for <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a>. The matter became public in June 1972 and the three astronauts were reprimanded for poor judgment; none ever flew in space again. During the investigation, the astronauts had surrendered those covers still in their possession; after Worden filed suit, they were returned in 1983. 

Another controversy surrounding the "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>" statuette that Scott had left on the Moon, arose later. Before the mission, Scott had made a verbal agreement with Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck to <a href="sculpture">sculpt</a> the statuette. Scott's intent, in keeping with NASA's strict policy against commercial exploitation of the US government's space program, was for a simple memorial with a minimum of publicity, keeping the artist anonymous, no commercial replicas being made except for a single copy for public exhibit at the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> commissioned after the sculpture's public disclosure during the post-flight press conference. Van Hoeydonck claims to have had a different understanding of the agreement, by which he would have received recognition as the creator of a tribute to human space exploration, with rights to sell replicas to the public. Under pressure from NASA, Van Hoeydonck canceled a plan to publicly sell 950 signed copies. 

The Apollo 15 <a href="mission%20patch">mission patch</a> carries Air Force motifs, a nod to the crew's service there, just as the Apollo 12 all-Navy crew's patch had featured a sailing ship. The circular patch features stylized red, white and blue birds flying over Hadley Rille. Immediately behind the birds, a line of craters form the <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numeral</a> XV. The Roman numerals were hidden in emphasized outlines of some craters after NASA insisted that the mission number be displayed in <a href="Arabic%20numerals">Arabic numerals</a>. The artwork is circled in red, with a white band giving the mission and crew names and a blue border. Scott contacted fashion designer <a href="Emilio%20Pucci">Emilio Pucci</a> to design the patch, who came up with the basic idea of the three-bird motif on a square patch. The crew changed the shape to round and the colors from blues and greens to a patriotic red, white and blue. Worden stated that each bird also represented an astronaut, white being his own color (and as Command Module Pilot, uppermost), Scott being the blue bird and Irwin the red. The colors also matched <a href="Corvette">Corvette</a>s driven by the astronauts at KSC; they were photographed with the cars and the training LRV for the June 11, 1971 edition of <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life"</a> magazine.

The halo area of the Apollo 15 landing site, created by the LM's exhaust plume, was observed by a camera aboard the Japanese lunar orbiter <a href="SELENE">SELENE</a> and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008. This corresponds well to photographs taken from the Apollo 15 command module showing a change in surface reflectivity due to the plume, and was the first visible trace of manned landings on the Moon seen from space since the close of the Apollo program.

Ælfheah of Canterbury

Ælfheah (<a href="circa">c.</a> 953 – 19 April 1012) was an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. He became an <a href="anchorite">anchorite</a> before being elected abbot of <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath Abbey</a>. His reputation for piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the <a href="Bishop">episcopate</a>, and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. Ælfheah furthered the cult of <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a> and also encouraged learning. He was captured by <a href="Viking">Viking</a> raiders in 1011 during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Canterbury">Siege of Canterbury</a> and later killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. Ælfheah was <a href="Canonization">canonised</a> as a <a href="saint">saint</a> in 1078. <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>.

Purportedly born in <a href="Weston%2C%20Bath">Weston</a> on the outskirts of Bath, Ælfheah became a monk early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of <a href="Deerhurst">Deerhurst</a>, but then moved to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity and rose to become <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a>, but this is not accepted by all historians. Indications are that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.

Probably due to the influence of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984, and was consecrated on 19 October that year. While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large <a href="Pipe%20organ">organ</a> in the <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">cathedral</a>, audible from over a mile (1600 m) away and said to require more than 24 men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches, and promoted the cult of <a href="Swithun">Swithun</a> and his own predecessor, <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold of Winchester</a>. One act promoting Æthelwold's cult was the <a href="translation%20%28relic%29">translation</a> of Æthelwold's body to a new tomb in the cathedral at Winchester, which Ælfheah presided over on 10 September 996.

Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders, <a href="Olaf%20Tryggvason">Olaf Tryggvason</a>. Besides receiving <a href="danegeld">danegeld</a>, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.

In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Abingdon">Ælfric</a> as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's head with him as a <a href="relic">relic</a> for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope <a href="Pope%20John%20XVIII">John XVIII</a>, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of Dunstan, ordering the writing of the second "Life of Dunstan", which <a href="Adelard%20of%20Ghent">Adelard of Ghent</a> composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the <a href="Witenagemot">Witenagemot</a>'s recognition of <a href="Wulfsige%20III">Wulfsige of Sherborne</a> as a saint in about 1012.

Ælfheah sent <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Eynsham">Ælfric of Eynsham</a> to <a href="Cerne%20Abbey">Cerne Abbey</a> to take charge of its monastic school. He was present at the council of May 1008 at which <a href="Wulfstan%20II">Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York</a>, preached his "<a href="Sermo%20Lupi%20ad%20Anglos">Sermo Lupi ad Anglos</a>" ("The Sermon of the Wolf to the English"), castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.

In 1011 the <a href="Viking">Danes</a> again raided England, and from 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of Ælfmaer, whose life Ælfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city. Ælfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months. <a href="Godwine%20I">Godwine</a> (<a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>), <a href="Leofrun">Leofrun</a> (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's <a href="Reeve%20%28England%29">reeve</a>, Ælfweard were captured also, but the abbot of <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, <a href="%C3%86lfm%C3%A6r%20%28Bishop%20of%20Sherborne%29">Ælfmær</a>, managed to escape. Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following Ælfheah's capture.

Ælfheah refused to allow a ransom to be paid for his freedom, and as a result was killed on 19 April 1012 at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> (then in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, now part of London), reputedly on the site of <a href="St%20Alfege%20Church%2C%20Greenwich">St Alfege's Church</a>. The account of Ælfheah's death appears in the E version of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>": 

Ælfheah was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death. A contemporary report tells that <a href="Thorkell%20the%20Tall">Thorkell the Tall</a> attempted to save Ælfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering everything he owned except for his ship, in exchange for Ælfheah's life; Thorkell's presence is not mentioned in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", however. Some sources record that the final blow, with the back of an axe, was delivered as an <a href="Coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">act of kindness</a> by a Christian convert known as "Thrum." Ælfheah was buried in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. In 1023 his body was moved by King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> to <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, with great ceremony. Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a> following Ælfheah's death.

Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Gregory VII</a> canonised Ælfheah in 1078, with a <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast day</a> of 19 April. <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, the first <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">post-Conquest</a> archbishop, was dubious about some of the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of Ælfheah's sanctity, but Ælfheah and <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a> were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's calendar of saints. Ælfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early 12th century under <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, who was instrumental in retaining Ælfheah's name in the church calendar. After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, Ælfheah's remains together with those of Dunstan were placed around the high altar, at which Thomas Becket is said to have commended his life into Ælfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom during the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket controversy</a>. The new shrine was sealed in lead, and was north of the high altar, sharing the honour with Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the high altar. A "Life of Saint Ælfheah" in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named <a href="Osbern%20of%20Canterbury">Osbern</a>, at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the "Life" is very much a <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.

In the late medieval period, Ælfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, perhaps because of the saint's connection with Cnut. Few church dedications to him are known, with most of them occurring in Kent and one each in London and Winchester; as well as <a href="St%20Alfege%27s%20Church">St Alfege's Church</a> in Greenwich, a <a href="St%20Alfege%27s%20Hospital">nearby hospital</a> (1931–1968) was named after him. In the town of Solihull in the West Midlands <a href="St%20Alphege%20Church%2C%20Solihull">St Alphege Church</a> is dedicated to Ælfheah dating back to approximately 1277. In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Ælfheah, under the name Alphege, designed by <a href="Giles%20Gilbert%20Scott">Giles Gilbert Scott</a> in homage to the ancient Roman church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20in%20Cosmedin">Santa Maria in Cosmedin</a>.

Ælle of Sussex

Ælle (also Aelle or Ella) is recorded in early sources as the first <a href="monarchy">king</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sussex">South Saxons</a>, reigning in what is now called <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, England, from 477 to perhaps as late as 514.

According to the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", Ælle and three of his sons are said to have landed at a place called <a href="Cymenshore">Cymensora</a> and fought against the local <a href="Brython">Britons</a>. The chronicle goes on to report a victory in 491, at present day <a href="Pevensey">Pevensey</a>, where the battle ended with the Saxons slaughtering their opponents to the last man.

Ælle was the first king recorded by the 8th century chronicler <a href="Bede">Bede</a> to have held "<a href="imperium">imperium</a>", or overlordship, over other <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdoms. In the late 9th-century "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" (around four hundred years after his time) Ælle is recorded as being the first <a href="bretwalda">bretwalda</a>, or "Britain-ruler", though there is no evidence that this was a contemporary title. Ælle's death is not recorded and although he may have been the founder of a South Saxon dynasty, there is no firm evidence linking him with later South Saxon rulers. The 12th-century chronicler <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> produced an enhanced version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" that included 514 as the date of Ælle's death, but this is not secure.

Historians are divided on the detail of Ælle's life and existence as it was during the least-documented period in English history of the last two millennia.

By the early 5th century Britain had been <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> for over three hundred and fifty years. Amongst the enemies of Roman Britain were the <a href="Pict">Pict</a>s of central and northern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and the <a href="Gaels">Gaels</a> known as <a href="Scoti">Scoti</a>, who were raiders from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Also vexatious were the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, the name Roman writers gave to the peoples who lived in the northern part of what is now Germany and the southern part of the <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> peninsula. Saxon raids on the southern and eastern shores of England had been sufficiently alarming by the late 3rd century for the Romans to build the <a href="Saxon%20Shore%20Forts">Saxon Shore forts</a>, and subsequently to establish the role of the <a href="Count%20of%20the%20Saxon%20Shore">Count of the Saxon Shore</a> to command the defence against these incursions. Roman control of Britain finally ended in the early part of the 5th century; the date usually given as marking the end of Roman Britain is 410, when the Emperor <a href="Honorius%20%28emperor%29">Honorius</a> sent letters to the British, urging them to look to their own defence. Britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers' claims to the Roman empire, and after 410 the Roman armies never returned.

Sources for events after this date are extremely scarce, but a tradition, reported as early as the mid-6th century by a British priest named <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>, records that the British sent for help against the barbarians to <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Aetius</a>, a Roman <a href="consul">consul</a>, probably in the late 440s. No help came. Subsequently, a British leader named <a href="Vortigern">Vortigern</a> is supposed to have invited continental mercenaries to help fight the Picts who were attacking from the north. The leaders, whose names are recorded as <a href="Hengest">Hengest</a> and <a href="Horsa">Horsa</a>, rebelled, and a long period of warfare ensued. The invaders—<a href="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a>, and <a href="Frisii">Frisians</a>—gained control of parts of England, but lost a major battle at <a href="Mons%20Badonicus">Mons Badonicus</a> (the location of which is not known). Some authors have speculated that Ælle may have led the Saxon forces at this battle, while others reject the idea out of hand.

The British thus gained a respite, and peace lasted at least until the time Gildas was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, from around the end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth. Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of southern England was under the control of the continental invaders.

There are two early sources that mention Ælle by name. The earliest is "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">The Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", a history of the English church written in 731 by <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, a <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n monk. Bede mentions Ælle as one of the Anglo-Saxon kings who exercised what he calls "imperium" over "all the provinces south of the river <a href="Humber">Humber</a>"; "imperium" is usually translated as "overlordship". Bede gives a list of seven kings who held "imperium", and Ælle is the first of them. The other information Bede gives is that Ælle was not a Christian—Bede mentions a later king as "the first to enter the kingdom of heaven".

The second source is the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", a collection of annals assembled in the Kingdom of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> in c. 890, during the reign of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. The "Chronicle" has three entries for Ælle, from 477 to 491, as follows:


The "Chronicle" was put together about four hundred years after these events. It is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles, as well as from oral sources such as sagas, but there is no way to tell where these lines came from. It should also be noted that the terms 'British' and 'Welsh' were used interchangeably, as 'Welsh' is the Saxon word meaning 'foreigner', and was applied to all the native Romano-British of the era.

Three of the places named may be identified :

The "Chronicle" mentions Ælle once more under the year 827, where he is listed as the first of the eight "<a href="bretwaldas">bretwaldas</a>", or "Britain-rulers". The list consists of Bede's original seven, plus <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert of Wessex</a>. There has been much scholarly debate over just what it meant to be a "bretwalda", and the extent of Ælle's actual power in southern England is an open question. It is also noteworthy that there is a long gap between Ælle and the second king on Bede's list, <a href="Ceawlin%20of%20Wessex">Ceawlin of Wessex</a>, whose reign began in the late 6th century; this may indicate a period in which Anglo-Saxon dominance was interrupted in some way.

Earlier sources than Bede exist which mention the South Saxons, though they do not name Ælle. The earliest reference is still quite late, however, at about 692: a charter of King <a href="Nothelm%20of%20Sussex">Nothelm</a>'s, which styles him "King of the South Saxons". Charters are documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which would be witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land. They are one of the key documentary sources for Anglo-Saxon history, but no original charters survive from earlier than 679.

There are other early writers whose works can shed light on Ælle's time, though they do not mention either him or his kingdom. Gildas's description of the state of Britain in his time is useful for understanding the ebb and flow of the Anglo-Saxon incursions. <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a>, a <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> historian, writing not long after Gildas, adds to the meagre sources on population movement by including a chapter on England in one of his works. He records that the peoples of Britain—he names the English, the British, and the Frisians—were so numerous that they were migrating to the kingdom of the Franks in great numbers every year, although this is probably a reference to Britons emigrating to <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a> to escape the Anglo-Saxons. They subsequently gave their name to the area they settled as <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, or "la petite Bretagne" (lit., "little Britain").

The early dates given in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" for the colonization of Sussex are supported by an analysis of the place names of the region. The strongest evidence comes from place names that end in "-ing", such as <a href="Worthing">Worthing</a> and <a href="Angmering">Angmering</a>. These are known to derive from an earlier form ending in "-ingas". "<a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>" for example, derives from "Hæstingas" which may mean "the followers or dependents of a person named Hæsta", although others suggest the heavily Romanised region may have had names of Gallo-Roman origin derived from "-ienses".

From west of Selsey Bill to east of Pevensey can be found the densest concentration of these names anywhere in Britain. There are a total of about forty-five place names in Sussex of this form, but personal names either were not associated with these places or fell out of use. This does not necessarily mean that the Saxons killed or drove out almost all of the native population, despite the slaughter of the Britons reported in the "Chronicle" entry for 491; however, it does imply that the invasion was on a scale that left little space for the British.

These lines of reasoning cannot prove the dates given in the "Chronicle", much less the details surrounding Ælle himself, but they do support the idea of an early conquest and the establishment of a settled kingdom.

If the dates given by the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" are accurate to within half a century, then Ælle's reign lies in the middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, and prior to the final conquest of the Britons. It also seems consistent with the dates given to assume that Ælle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.This in turn would explain the long gap, of fifty or more years, in the succession of the "bretwaldas": if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century, it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>. Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a> (now <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, in <a href="France">France</a>); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from <a href="Dumnonia">Dumnonia</a> (modern <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>), and the area acquired regions known as Dumnonée and Cornouaille. It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.

The dates for Ælle's battles are also reasonably consistent with what is known of events in the kingdom of the Franks at that time. <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a> united the Franks into a single kingdom during the 480s and afterwards, and the Franks' ability to exercise power along the southern coast of the English channel may have diverted Saxon adventurers to England rather than the continent.

It is possible, therefore, that a historical king named Ælle existed, who arrived from the continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered much of what is now Sussex. He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time. This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain. The battles listed in the "Chronicle" are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years. His area of military control may have extended as far as <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and north to the upper <a href="Thames">Thames</a> valley, but it certainly did not extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.

The historian <a href="Guy%20Halsall">Guy Halsall</a> argues that as Ælle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda, it is far more likely that Ælle dates to the mid sixth century, and that the "Chronicle" has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.

Ælle's death is not recorded by the "Chronicle", which gives no information about him, or his sons, or the South Saxons until 675, when the South Saxon king <a href="Aethelwalh%20of%20Sussex">Æthelwalh</a> was baptized.

It has been conjectured that, as Saxon war leader, Ælle may have met his death in the disastrous battle of <a href="Mount%20Badon">Mount Badon</a> when the Britons halted Saxon expansion. If Ælle died within the borders of his own kingdom then it may well have been that he was buried on <a href="Highdown%20Hill">Highdown Hill</a> with his weapons and ornaments in the usual mode of burial among the South Saxons. Highdown Hill is the traditional burial-place of the kings of Sussex.

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by the 18th-century British <a href="proto-feminist">proto-feminist</a> <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, is one of the earliest works of <a href="feminist%20philosophy">feminist philosophy</a>. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should receive a rational education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be "companions" to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.

Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the "Rights of Woman" after reading <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</a>'s 1791 report to the French <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Assembly</a>, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the "Rights of Woman" hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the "Rights of Woman" was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>'s "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). The "Rights of Woman" was actually well received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it "perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century".

"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" was written against the tumultuous background of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the "<a href="Revolution%20controversy">Revolution controversy</a>", British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>", a response to <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790). In his "Reflections", Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> (1642–1651) in which <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In "Reflections" he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's "Rights of Men", published just six weeks after Burke's "Reflections", is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.

When <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</a> presented his "Rapport sur l'instruction publique" (1791) to the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28French%20Revolution%29">National Assembly</a> in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond. In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:

Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them . . . Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.
Wollstonecraft dedicated the "Rights of Woman" to Talleyrand: "Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education." At the end of 1791, French feminist <a href="Olympe%20de%20Gouges">Olympe de Gouges</a> had published her "<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman%20and%20the%20Female%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen</a>", and the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.

The "Rights of Woman" is an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the "Rights of Men". In the "Rights of Men", as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the "Rights of Woman", she is concerned with the rights afforded to "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the "Rights of Woman" addresses the issue of <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. "The Rights of Woman" thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by <a href="Political%20philosophy">political philosophers</a> such as <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.

Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The "Rights of Woman" is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>.

In the 18th century, "sensibility" was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathise with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the <a href="abolitionism">movement to abolish the slave trade</a>. But sensibility also paralysed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, "an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder".

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the "Rights of Woman", sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years. Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as "profoundly separatist"; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling. Furthermore, as <a href="Janet%20Todd">Janet Todd</a>, another scholar of sensibility, argues, "to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men."

One of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the "Rights of Woman" is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as <a href="Catharine%20Macaulay">Catharine Macaulay</a> and <a href="Hester%20Chapone">Hester Chapone</a>, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787), in her children's book, "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788), as well as in the "Rights of Woman".

Stating in her preface that "my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures". Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as "spaniels" and "toys"). While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women might not be able to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.

Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as <a href="James%20Fordyce">James Fordyce</a> and <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28moralist%29">John Gregory</a> as well as educational philosophers such as <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in "" (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational "companions" of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to <a href="wikt%3Aallot">allot</a> to them . . . they might, also, study politics . . . Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue."

For Wollstonecraft, "the most perfect education" is "an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent." In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter <a href="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a>'s. In Chapter 12, "On National Education," she proposes that children be sent to <a href="day%20school">day school</a>s as well as given some education at home "to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures," and that such schools be free for children "five to nine years of age." She also maintains that schooling should be <a href="coeducation">co-educational</a>, contending that men and women, whose marriages are "the cement of society," should be "educated after the same model."

It is debatable to what extent the "Rights of Woman" is a <a href="feminist">feminist</a> text; because the definitions of "feminist" vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words "feminist" and "feminism" were not coined until the 1890s. Moreover, there was no <a href="feminist%20movement">feminist movement</a> to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, <a href="Barbara%20Taylor">Barbara Taylor</a> writes:

Describing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic . . . Treating Wollstonecraft's thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this . . . have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft's political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women's emancipation. Wollstonecraft's leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.

In the "Rights of Woman", Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

However, Wollstonecraft's arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states:

Let it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.
Moreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the "Rights of Woman". Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation—men must come to their aid. Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter "Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society":

I then would <a href="wikt%3Afain">fain</a> convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations. – I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers – in a word, better citizens.

It is Wollstonecraft's last novel, "" (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the "Rights of Woman", that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.

One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the "Rights of Woman" is against false and excessive <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because these women are "the prey of their senses", they cannot think rationally. In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, the passions underpin all reason. This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels "" (1788) and "".

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" is a ""<a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>"" of the "Rights of Woman". For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to "calmly let passion subside into friendship" in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when "two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the "Rights of Woman" eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" while at the same time "exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality."

<a href="Claudia%20L.%20Johnson%20%28scholar%29">Claudia Johnson</a>, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the "Rights of Woman" "a republican manifesto". Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the <a href="Commonwealth%20men">Commonwealth</a> tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a <a href="republicanism">republican</a> ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens. According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft "denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men". If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society. Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Rights of Men</a>" and the "Rights of Woman", of the "masculinization of sensitivity" in such works as <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>".

In the "Rights of Woman" Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her "political criticism," as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, "is couched predominantly in terms of morality". Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual's happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society. This is reflected in her explanation of <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a>. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.

In many ways the "Rights of Woman" is inflected by a <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Rights of Men</a>". Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the "most natural state". She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" of the rich, calling them "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".

But Wollstonecraft's criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: "Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!" Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she "sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich".

In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: "After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature."

In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her "<a href="wikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a>", constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the "Rights of Woman". She uses the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a "treatise" with "arguments" and "principles". However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing "I" and "you", dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text. The "Rights of Woman" further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.

Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, the rhetoric of the "Rights of Woman" is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Rousseau</a>. For example, after excerpting a long passage from "" (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to "capricious tyrants" who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin. Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance and obedience. And like the rich, women's "softness" has "debased mankind".

Wollstonecraft was forced to write the "Rights of Woman" hurriedly to respond to <a href="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a> and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend <a href="William%20Roscoe">William Roscoe</a>: "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject. – Do not suspect me of false modesty – I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word . . . I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." When Wollstonecraft revised the "Rights of Woman" for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.

Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the "Rights of Woman," although <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> published her "Hints", which were "chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the "Vindication of the Rights of Woman"", in the posthumous collection of her works. However, she did begin writing the novel "", which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the "Rights of Woman". It was unfinished at her death and also included in the "Posthumous Works" published by Godwin.

When it was first published in 1792, the "Rights of Woman" was reviewed favourably by the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", the "General Magazine", the "Literary Magazine", "New York Magazine", and the "Monthly Review", although the assumption persists even today that "Rights of Woman" received hostile reviews. It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that "it was an immediate success". Moreover, other writers such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a> and <a href="Mary%20Robinson%20%28poet%29">Mary Robinson</a> specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the "Rights of Woman" in her novel "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20Emma%20Courtney">Memoirs of Emma Courtney</a>" (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.

Although female conservatives such as <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a> excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on "Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work". During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a> and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the "Rights of Woman". The work also provoked outright hostility. The <a href="bluestocking">bluestocking</a> <a href="Elizabeth%20Carter">Elizabeth Carter</a> was unimpressed with the work. <a href="Thomas%20Taylor%20%28neoplatonist%29">Thomas Taylor</a>, the <a href="Neoplatonist">Neoplatonist</a> translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called "A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes": if women have rights, why not <a href="animal%20rights">animals too</a>?

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> published his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. <a href="Richard%20Polwhele">Richard Polwhele</a> targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem "<a href="The%20Unsex%27d%20Females">The Unsex'd Females</a>" (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was "well known" among the responses "A Vindication". One reviewer comments this "ingenious poem" with its "playful sallies of sarcastic wit" against "our modern ladies," though others found it "a tedious, lifeless piece of writing." Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.

Wollstonecraft's ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her "Rights of Woman", for example, did not include her in the collection of "Illustrious and Celebrated Women" she published in 1803. <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel "<a href="Belinda%20%28Edgeworth%20novel%29">Belinda</a>" (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.

The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The "Rights of Woman" was not reprinted until the middle of the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a> wrote "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the "Rights of Woman" as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".
The <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a> (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>) <a href="Millicent%20Garrett%20Fawcett">Millicent Garrett Fawcett</a> wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the "Rights of Woman", cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. While the "Rights of Woman" may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new "experiments in living", as <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft. However, there is some evidence that the "Rights of Woman" may be influencing current feminists. <a href="Ayaan%20Hirsi%20Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, a feminist who is critical of <a href="Women%20and%20Islam">Islam's dictates regarding women</a>, cites the "Rights of Woman" in her autobiography "<a href="Infidel%20%28book%29">Infidel</a>", writing that she was "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights".

A Wizard of Earthsea

A Wizard of Earthsea is a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> novel written by American author <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> and first published by the <a href="small%20press">small press</a> Parnassus in 1968. It is regarded as a classic of children's literature, and of fantasy, within which it was widely influential. The story is set in the fictional <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> of <a href="Earthsea%20%28universe%29">Earthsea</a> and centers around a young <a href="Magician%20%28fantasy%29">mage</a> named <a href="Ged%20%28Earthsea%29">Ged</a>, born in a village on the island of Gont. He displays great power while still a boy and joins the school of wizardry, where his prickly nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows. During a magical duel, Ged's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him. The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature.

The book has often been described as a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>," or coming-of-age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. The structure of the story is similar to that of a <a href="Epic%20poetry">traditional epic</a>, although critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist <a href="Person%20of%20color">dark-skinned</a> in contrast to more typical <a href="White%20people">white-skinned</a> heroes.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" received highly positive reviews, initially as a work for children and later among a general audience, as well. It won the <a href="Boston%20Globe%E2%80%93Horn%20Book%20Award">Boston Globe–Horn Book Award</a> in 1969 and was one of the final recipients of the <a href="Lewis%20Carroll%20Shelf%20Award">Lewis Carroll Shelf Award</a> in 1979. <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> called it one of the "wellsprings" of fantasy literature. Le Guin wrote five subsequent books that are collectively referred to as the "<a href="Earthsea">Earthsea Cycle</a>", together with "A Wizard of Earthsea": "<a href="The%20Tombs%20of%20Atuan">The Tombs of Atuan</a>" (1971), "<a href="The%20Farthest%20Shore">The Farthest Shore</a>" (1972), "<a href="Tehanu">Tehanu</a>" (1990), "<a href="The%20Other%20Wind">The Other Wind</a>" (2001), and "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea">Tales from Earthsea</a>" (2001). <a href="George%20Slusser">George Slusser</a> described the series as a "work of high style and imagination", while <a href="Amanda%20Craig">Amanda Craig</a> said that "A Wizard of Earthsea" was "the most thrilling, wise, and beautiful children's novel ever".

Early concepts for the Earthsea setting were developed in two short stories, "<a href="The%20Rule%20of%20Names">The Rule of Names</a>" (1964) and "<a href="The%20Word%20of%20Unbinding">The Word of Unbinding</a>" (1964), both published in "<a href="Fantastic%20%28magazine%29">Fantastic</a>". The stories were later collected in Le Guin's anthology "<a href="The%20Wind%27s%20Twelve%20Quarters">The Wind's Twelve Quarters</a>" (1975). Earthsea was also used as the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published. In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of <a href="Ruth%20Robbins">Ruth Robbins</a>, the illustrator of the book) asked Le Guin to try writing a book "for older kids", giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach. Le Guin had no previous experience specifically with the genre of young adult literature, which rose in prominence during the late 1960s. Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on "A Wizard of Earthsea". Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from. Le Guin later said that she chose the medium of fantasy, and the theme of coming of age, with her intended adolescent audience in mind.

The short stories published in 1964 introduced the world of <a href="Earthsea">Earthsea</a> and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's <a href="Earthsea%20%28universe%29%23Magic%20in%20Earthsea">treatment of magic</a>. It also introduced Yevaud, a dragon who featured briefly in "A Wizard of Earthsea". Le Guin's depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> legends as well as <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. Her knowledge of myths and legends, as well as her familial interest in anthropology, have been described by scholar Donna White as allowing her to create "entire cultures" for the islands of Earthsea. The influence of Norse lore in particular can be seen in the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers. The influence of <a href="Taoism">Taoist thought</a> on Le Guin's writing is also visible in the idea of a cosmic "balance" in the universe of Earthsea.

Earthsea itself is an <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> or group of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is <a href="Pre-industrial%20society">preindustrial</a>, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned <a href="Karg">Karg</a>ish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.

The novel follows a young boy called <a href="Ged%20%28Earthsea%29">Duny</a>, nicknamed "Sparrowhawk", born on the island of Gont. Discovering that the boy has great innate power, his aunt teaches him the little magic she knows. When his village is attacked by Kargish raiders, Duny summons a fog to conceal the village and its inhabitants, enabling the residents to drive off the Kargs. Hearing of this, the powerful mage <a href="Aihal">Ogion</a> takes him as an apprentice, giving him his "true name"—Ged. Ogion tries to teach Ged about the "equilibrium", the concept that magic can upset the natural order of the world if used improperly. In an attempt to impress a girl, however, Ged searches Ogion's spell books and inadvertently summons a strange shadow, which has to be banished by Ogion. Sensing Ged's eagerness to act and impatience with his slow teaching methods, Ogion sends him to the renowned school for wizards on the island of Roke.

At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration even among the teachers. He is befriended by an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel of magic. Ged casts a powerful spell intended to raise the spirit of a legendary dead woman, but the spell goes awry and instead releases a shadow creature, which attacks him and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle drives the shadow away, but at the cost of his life.

Ged spends many months healing before resuming his studies. The new Archmage, Gensher, describes the shadow as an ancient evil that wishes to <a href="demonic%20possession">possess</a> Ged, and warns him that the creature has no name. Ged eventually receives his wizard's staff, and takes up residence in the Ninety Isles, providing the poor villagers protection from the dragons that have seized and taken up residence on the nearby island of Pendor, but discovers that he is still being sought by the shadow. Knowing that he cannot guard against both threats at the same time, he sails to Pendor and gambles his life on a guess of the adult dragon's true name. When he is proved right, the dragon offers to tell him the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon and his offspring will never threaten the archipelago.

Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, having heard of the stone of the Terrenon. He is attacked by the shadow, and barely escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, the lady of the castle, shows him the stone, and urges Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Recognizing that the stone harbors one of the Old Powers—ancient, powerful, malevolent beings—Ged refuses. He flees and is pursued by the stone's minions, but <a href="Shapeshifting">transforms</a> into a swift falcon and escapes.

Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont. Unlike Gensher, Ogion insists that all creatures have a name and advises Ged to confront the shadow. Ogion is proved right; when Ged seeks out the shadow, it flees from him. Ged pursues it in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog where the boat is wrecked on a <a href="reef">reef</a>. Ged recovers with the help of an elderly couple marooned on a small island since they were children; the woman gives Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and resumes his pursuit of the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish, he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Naming it with his own name, Ged merges with it and joyfully tells Vetch he is healed and whole.

The first edition of the book, published in 1968, was illustrated by <a href="Ruth%20Robbins">Ruth Robbins</a>. The cover illustration was in color, and the interior of the book contained a map of the archipelago of Earthsea. In addition, each chapter had a black-and-white illustration by Robbins, similar to a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> image. The images represented topics from each chapter; for instance, the very first image depicted the island of Gont, while the illustration for the chapter "The Dragon of Pendor" pictured a flying dragon. The image shown here depicts Ged sailing in his boat "Lookfar", and was used in the 10th chapter, "The Open Sea", in which Ged and Vetch travel from Iffish eastward past all known lands to confront the shadow creature.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" was first published in 1968 by <a href="Parnassus%20Press">Parnassus Press</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, a year before "<a href="The%20Left%20Hand%20of%20Darkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a>", Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her first attempt at writing <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a>, rather than science-fiction. "A Wizard of Earthsea" was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated <a href="Folio%20Society">Folio Society</a> edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works was released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of "A Wizard of Earthsea" in 2018.

Le Guin originally intended for "A Wizard of Earthsea" to be a standalone novel, but decided to write a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and "<a href="The%20Tombs%20of%20Atuan">The Tombs of Atuan</a>" was released in 1971. "<a href="The%20Farthest%20Shore">The Farthest Shore</a>" was written as a third volume after further consideration, and was published in 1972. "The Tombs of Atuan" tells of the story of Ged's attempt to make whole the ring of Erreth Akbe, half of which is buried in the tombs of Atuan in the Kargish lands, from where he must steal it. There, he meets the child priestess Tenar, on whom the book focuses. In "The Farthest Shore", Ged, who has become Archmage, tries to combat a dwindling of magic across Earthsea, accompanied by Arren, a young prince. The first three books are together seen as the "original trilogy"; in each of these, Ged is shown as trying to heal some imbalance in the world. They were followed by "<a href="Tehanu">Tehanu</a>" (1990), "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea">Tales from Earthsea</a>" (2001), and "<a href="The%20Other%20Wind">The Other Wind</a>" (2001), which are sometimes referred to as the "second trilogy".

Initial recognition for the book was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. "A Wizard of Earthsea" received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection "Fantasy for Children", British critic <a href="Naomi%20Lewis">Naomi Lewis</a> described it in the following terms: "[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time." Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that "Le Guin has ... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" by author and journalist <a href="Amanda%20Craig">Amanda Craig</a> said it was "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail." In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians <a href="Eleanor%20Cameron">Eleanor Cameron</a> praised the world building in the story, saying "it is as if [Le Guin] herself has lived on the archipelago." Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as <a href="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> were "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a "fully thought-out inner life" despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.

Commentators have noted that the Earthsea novels in general received less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a>, describing it as "adult chauvinist piggery". In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'". Barbara Bucknall stated that "Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age." Only in later years did "A Wizard of Earthsea" receive attention from a more general audience. Literary scholar T. A. Shippey was among the first to treat "A Wizard of Earthsea" as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> and <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, among others. Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as "a fantasy book for adults", and added that the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as "life and mortality and who are we as human beings", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. The "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went "far beyond" the young adults for whom it was written. It went on to praise the book as "austere but vivid", and said the series was more thoughtful than the "<a href="Narnia">Narnia</a>" books by C. S. Lewis. In his 1980 history of fantasy, <a href="Brian%20Attebery">Brian Attebery</a> called the Earthsea trilogy "the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date". Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a "work of high style and imagination", and the original trilogy of books a product of "genuine epic vision". In 1974, critic <a href="Robert%20Scholes">Robert Scholes</a> compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, saying, "Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure." He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave. In 2014 David Pringle called it "a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound".

"A Wizard of Earthsea" won or contributed to several notable awards for Le Guin. It won the <a href="Boston%20Globe%E2%80%93Horn%20Book%20Award">Boston Globe–Horn Book Award</a> in 1969, and was one of the last winners of the <a href="Lewis%20Carroll%20Shelf%20Award">Lewis Carroll Shelf Award</a> ten years later. In 1984 it won the or the "Golden Sepulka" in Poland. In 2000 Le Guin was given the <a href="Margaret%20A.%20Edwards%20Award">Margaret A. Edwards Award</a> by the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> for young adult literature. The award cited six of her works, including the first four Earthsea volumes, "The Left Hand of Darkness", and "<a href="The%20Beginning%20Place">The Beginning Place</a>". A 1987 poll in "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>" ranked "A Wizard of Earthsea" third among "All-Time Best Fantasy Novels", while in 2014 Pringle listed it at number 39 in his list of the 100 best novels in modern fantasy.

The book has been seen as widely influential within the genre of fantasy. <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> has called "A Wizard of Earthsea" one of the "wellsprings" of fantasy literature. The book has been compared to major works of <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> such as <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and <a href="L.%20Frank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>". The notion that names can exert power is also present in <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s 2001 film "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>"; critics have suggested that that idea originated with Le Guin's Earthsea series. Novelist <a href="David%20Mitchell%20%28author%29">David Mitchell</a>, author of books such as "<a href="Cloud%20Atlas%20%28novel%29">Cloud Atlas</a>", described "A Wizard of Earthsea" as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to "wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin".

Modern writers have credited "A Wizard of Earthsea" for introducing the idea of a "wizard school", which would later be made famous by the "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in "Harry Potter". Reviewers have also commented that the basic premise of "A Wizard of Earthsea", that of a talented boy going to a wizard's school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of "Harry Potter". Ged also receives a scar from the shadow, which hurts whenever the shadow is near him, just as Harry Potter's scar from <a href="Voldemort">Voldemort</a>. Commenting on the similarity, Le Guin said that she did not feel that <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> "ripped her off", but that Rowling's books received too much praise for supposed originality, and that Rowling "could have been more gracious about her predecessors. My incredulity was at the critics who found the first book wonderfully original. She has many virtues, but originality isn't one of them. That hurt."

"A Wizard of Earthsea" focuses on Ged's adolescence and coming of age, and along with the other two works of the original Earthsea trilogy forms a part of Le Guin's dynamic portrayal of the process of growing old. The three novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, and each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character. The novel is frequently described as a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>". Scholar Mike Cadden stated that the book is a convincing tale "to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him". Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.

Ged is depicted as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually realize that there is a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.

The passage at the end of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself and is thus released from its terror, has been pointed to by reviewers as a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a>. Jeanne Walker, for example, wrote that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of "A Wizard of Earthsea", and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader. Walker goes on to say, "The entire action of A Wizard of Earthsea ... portrays the hero's slow realization of what it means to be an individual in society and a self in relation to higher powers. Many readers and critics have commented on similarities between Ged's process of growing up and ideas in <a href="Self%20in%20Jungian%20psychology">Jungian psychology</a>. The young Ged has a scary encounter with a <a href="Shadow%20%28psychology%29">shadow creature</a>, which he later realizes is the dark side of himself. It is only after he recognizes and merges with the shadow that he becomes a whole person. Le Guin said that she had never read <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jung</a> before writing the Earthsea novels.

Le Guin described coming of age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that "Coming of age ... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.

The world of Earthsea is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea (implicit in the name Earthsea), and between people and their natural environment. In addition to physical equilibrium, there is a larger cosmic equilibrium, which everybody is aware of, and which wizards are tasked with maintaining. Describing this aspect of Earthsea, Elizabeth Cummins wrote, "The principle of balanced powers, the recognition that every act affects self, society, world, and cosmos, is both a physical and a moral principle of Le Guin's fantasy world." The concept of balance is related to the novel's other major theme of coming of age, as Ged's knowledge of the consequences of his own actions for good or ill is necessary for him to understand how the balance is maintained. While at the school of Roke, the Master Hand tells him: 

The influence of Taoism on Le Guin's writing is evident through much of the book, especially in her depiction of the "balance". At the end of the novel, Ged, may be seen to embody the Taoist way of life, as he has learned not to act unless absolutely necessary. He has also learned that seeming opposites, like light and dark or good and evil, are actually interdependent. Light and dark themselves are recurring images within the story. Reviewers have identified this belief as evidence of a conservative ideology within the story, shared with much of fantasy. In emphasizing concerns over balance and equilibrium, scholars have argued, Le Guin essentially justifies the status quo, which wizards strive to maintain. This tendency is in contrast to Le Guin's science fiction writing, in which change is shown to have value.

The nature of human evil forms a significant related theme through "A Wizard of Earthsea" as well as the other Earthsea novels. As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him. Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does. When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions, and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself. His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying 

Thus, although there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil was not one of these powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature. This is contrary to conventional Western and Christian storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict. On two different occasions, Ged is tempted to try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.

In Le Guin's fictional universe, to know the <a href="true%20name">true name</a> of an object or a person is to have power over it. Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends. Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them. In "A Wizard of Earthsea", however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has attachment to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound by the power of his name. Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this. Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing. Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the "Rumpelstiltskin theory", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a> in "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>". Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In "A Wizard of Earthsea", Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in "The Tombs of Atuan", thereby allowing her to learn trust.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" and other novels of the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin's early <a href="Hainish%20cycle">Hainish cycle</a> works, although they were written at a similar time. George Slusser described the Earthsea works as providing a counterweight to the "excessive pessimism" of the Hainish novels. He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as "<a href="Vaster%20than%20Empires%20and%20More%20Slow">Vaster than Empires and More Slow</a>". The "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" said the book was pervaded by a "grave joyfulness". In discussing the style of her fantasy works, Le Guin herself said that in fantasy it was necessary to be clear and direct with language, because there is no known framework for the reader's mind to rest upon.

The story often appears to assume that readers are familiar with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid <a href="exposition%20%28narrative%29">exposition</a>: a reviewer wrote that this method "gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying". In keeping with the notion of an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea. At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as "strange and dreamlike", fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms. This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as "free indirect discourse" makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" has strong elements of an <a href="epic%20%28genre%29">epic</a>; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described at the very beginning of the book in the following terms: "some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared "A Wizard of Earthsea" to epics such as "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>". Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.

Le Guin subverted many of the tropes typical to such "monomyths"; the protagonists of her story were all <a href="Person%20of%20color">dark-skinned</a>, in comparison to the <a href="White%20people">white-skinned</a> heroes more traditionally used; the Kargish antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics. Critics have also cited her use of characters from multiple class backgrounds as a choice subversive to conventional Western fantasy. At the same time, reviewers questioned Le Guin's treatment of gender in "A Wizard of Earthsea", and the original trilogy as a whole. Le Guin, who later became known as a <a href="Feminism">feminist</a>, chose to restrict the use of magic to men and boys in the first volume of Earthsea. Initial critical reactions to "A Wizard of Earthsea" saw Ged's gender as incidental. In contrast, "The Tombs of Atuan" saw Le Guin intentionally tell a female coming-of-age story, which was nonetheless described as perpetuating a male-dominated model of Earthsea. "Tehanu" (1990), published as the fourth volume of "Earthsea" 18 years after the third, has been described both by Le Guin and her commentators as a feminist re-imagining of the series, in which the power and status of the chief characters are reversed, and the patriarchal social structure questioned. Commenting in 1993, Le Guin wrote that she could not continue [Earthsea after 1972] until she had "wrestled with the angels of the feminist consciousness".

Several critics have argued that by combining elements of epic, "Bildungsroman", and young adult fiction, Le Guin succeeded in blurring the boundaries of conventional genres. In a 1975 commentary Francis Molson argued that the series should be referred to as "ethical fantasy", a term which acknowledged that the story did not always follow the tropes of heroic fantasy, and the moral questions that it raised. The term did not become popular. A similar argument was made by children's literature critic Cordelia Sherman in 1985; she argued that "A Wizard of Earthsea" and the rest of the series sought "to teach children by dramatic example what it means to be a good adult".

A condensed, illustrated version of the first chapter was printed by <a href="World%20Books">World Books</a> in the third volume of "<a href="Childcraft">Childcraft</a>" in 1989. Multiple audio versions of the book have been released. BBC Radio produced a radioplay version in 1996 narrated by <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a>, and a six-part series adapting the Earthsea novels in 2015, broadcast on <a href="Radio%204%20Extra">Radio 4 Extra</a>. In 2011, the work was produced as an unabridged recording performed by <a href="Rob%20Inglis">Robert Inglis</a>.

Two screen adaptations of the story have also been produced. An original mini-series titled "<a href="Legend%20of%20Earthsea">Legend of Earthsea</a>" was broadcast in 2005 on the <a href="Syfy">Sci Fi Channel</a>. It is based very loosely on "A Wizard of Earthsea" and "The Tombs of Atuan". In an article published in "Salon", Le Guin expressed strong displeasure at the result. She stated that by casting a "petulant white kid" as Ged (who has red-brown skin in the book) the series "<a href="Whitewashing%20in%20film">whitewashed</a> Earthsea", and had ignored her choice to write the story of a non-white character, a choice she said was central to the book. This sentiment was shared by a review in "The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy", which said that "Legend of Earthsea" "totally missed the point" of Le Guin's novels, "ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place".

<a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> released an adaptation of the series in 2006 titled "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea%20%28film%29">Tales from Earthsea</a>". The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, and in particular the use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.

Archaeopteryx

Archaeopteryx (), meaning "old wing" (sometimes referred to by its German name ("original bird" or "first bird")), is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of bird-like <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s that is <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional</a> between non-avian <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered dinosaur</a>s and modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s. The name derives from the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> ("archaīos") meaning "ancient", and ("ptéryx"), meaning "feather" or "wing". Between the late nineteenth century and the early twenty-first century, "Archaeopteryx" had been generally accepted by <a href="Paleontology">palaeontologists</a> and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group <a href="Avialae">Avialae</a>). Older potential avialans have since been identified, including "<a href="Anchiornis">Anchiornis</a>", "<a href="Xiaotingia">Xiaotingia</a>", and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>".

"Archaeopteryx" lived in the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> around 150 million years ago, in what is now southern Germany during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the <a href="equator">equator</a> than it is now. Similar in size to a <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a>, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a <a href="raven">raven</a>, the largest species of "Archaeopteryx" could grow to about in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, "Archaeopteryx" had more in common with other small <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the <a href="dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurids</a> and <a href="troodontidae">troodontids</a>: jaws with sharp <a href="Tooth">teeth</a>, three fingers with <a href="claw">claw</a>s, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which also suggest <a href="homeothermy">warm-bloodedness</a>), and various features of the <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>.

These features make "Archaeopteryx" a clear candidate for a <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional fossil</a> between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, "Archaeopteryx" plays an important role, not only in the study of the <a href="origin%20of%20birds">origin of birds</a>, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single <a href="feather">feather</a> in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of "Archaeopteryx" was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of "Archaeopteryx" have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.

Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (<a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of "Archaeopteryx" was discovered just two years after <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> published "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>". "Archaeopteryx" seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>.

In March 2018, scientists reported that "Archaeopteryx" was likely capable of <a href="Bird%20flight">flight</a>, but in a manner substantially different from that of <a href="Birds">modern birds</a>.

Most of the specimens of "Archaeopteryx" that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils laid down during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 150.8–148.5 million years ago.

"Archaeopteryx" was roughly the size of a <a href="raven">raven</a>, with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to in body length, with an estimated mass of . "Archaeopteryx" feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure to modern-day bird feathers. Despite the presence of numerous avian features, "Archaeopteryx" had many non-avian <a href="theropoda">theropod dinosaur</a> characteristics. Unlike modern birds, "Archaeopteryx" had small teeth, as well as a long bony tail, features which "Archaeopteryx" shared with other dinosaurs of the time.

Because it displays features common to both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, "Archaeopteryx" has often been considered a link between them. In the 1970s, <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a>, following <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>'s lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and "Archaeopteryx" was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the <a href="Talus%20bone">ankle bone</a>, <a href="interdental%20plate">interdental plate</a>s, an <a href="obturator%20foramen">obturator</a> process of the <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that "Archaeopteryx" was remarkably similar to the theropod family <a href="Dromaeosauridae">Dromaeosauridae</a>.

Specimens of "Archaeopteryx" were most notable for their well-developed <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a <a href="barb%20%28feather%29">barb</a>-<a href="barbule">barbule</a>-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The <a href="thumb">thumb</a> did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of <a href="alula">stiff feathers</a>.

The body plumage of "Archaeopteryx" is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved <a href="The%20Berlin%20specimen">Berlin specimen</a>. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of "Archaeopteryx". In the Berlin specimen, there are "trousers" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure, but are somewhat decomposed (they lack <a href="barbicel">barbicel</a>s as in <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s). In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.

A patch of <a href="pennaceous%20feather">pennaceous feather</a>s is found running along its back, which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of "proto-<a href="Down%20feather">down</a>" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur "<a href="Sinosauropteryx">Sinosauropteryx</a>": decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens—and the lower neck.

There is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most "Archaeopteryx" specimens became embedded in <a href="Oxygen%20saturation">anoxic</a> sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (<a href="death%20pose">death pose</a>) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.

In 2011, graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an "Archaeopteryx" specimen. Using <a href="Scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscopy</a> technology and <a href="Energy-dispersive%20X-ray%20spectroscopy">energy-dispersive X-ray</a> analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of <a href="melanosome">melanosome</a>s in the isolated feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant measurements were then compared to those of 87 modern bird species, and the original colour was calculated with a 95% likelihood to be black. The feather was determined to be black throughout, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tip. The feather studied was most probably a dorsal <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">covert</a>, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that "Archaeopteryx" was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the "Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry", new analyses of "Archaeopteryx"'s feathers revealed that the animal may have had light-coloured inner vanes. This interpretation was based on synchrotron imaging of organic sulfur and trace metals, used as proxies for the presence of melanin. However, such biomarkers have been found to be non-specific for melanin, and thus it was suggested that the purported light-and-dark patterns were instead due to non-pigmentary organics and secondary precipitates. In 2014, Carney and colleagues presented additional data that the wing feather's color was matte black (as opposed to iridescent), due to the lower aspect ratio of the melanosomes detected in the fossil. Here they also provided evidence that the previous counter-interpretation of the feather having a light-coloured inner vane was not supported, due to the abundance of matte black melanosomes in this region.

As in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of "Archaeopteryx" were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether "Archaeopteryx" was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony <a href="Sternum">breastbone</a> suggests that "Archaeopteryx" was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>s, or perhaps, to a <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> <a href="sternum">sternum</a>. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between <a href="scapula">scapula</a>, coracoid, and <a href="humerus">humerus</a>—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that "Archaeopteryx" was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by <a href="Philip%20Senter">Philip Senter</a> in 2006, "Archaeopteryx" was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.

"Archaeopteryx" wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced <a href="turning%20radius">turning radius</a>. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush, such as <a href="crows">crows</a> and <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s). The presence of "hind wings", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>", also would have added to the aerial mobility of "Archaeopteryx". The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006, suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a>. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.

The feathers of "Archaeopteryx" were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of "Archaeopteryx" fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in "Archaeopteryx" is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.

In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal "Science" published a paper in which they analysed the <a href="rachis">rachis</a>es of the primary feathers of "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" and "Archaeopteryx". The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that "Archaeopteryx" and "Confuciusornis", were unable to use flapping flight. This study was criticized by <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that "Archaeopteryx" and "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. <a href="Gregory%20Paul">Gregory Paul</a> also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of for the Munich specimen "Archaeopteryx", a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about . Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises across. Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult "Archaeopteryx" would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the <a href="basilisk%20lizard">basilisk lizard</a>, which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits (see <a href="Bird%20flight%23Evolution%20of%20bird%20flight">Evolution of bird flight</a>).

In 2004, scientists analysing a detailed <a href="Computed%20tomography">CT scan</a> of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> of the London "Archaeopteryx" concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that "Archaeopteryx" had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. "Archaeopteryx" had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-<a href="coelurosaurian">coelurosaurian</a> dinosaurs such as "<a href="Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a>" or "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the "Archaeopteryx" brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among <a href="maniraptoran">Maniraptora</a> dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.

Recent studies of flight feather barb geometry reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather, whereas "Archaeopteryx" lacks this large barb angle, indicating potentially weak flight abilities.

"Archaeopteryx" continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the "trees down" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">O. C. Marsh</a>). Other scientists see "Archaeopteryx" as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the "ground up" hypothesis proposed by <a href="Samuel%20Wendell%20Williston">Samuel Wendell Williston</a>). Still others suggest that "Archaeopteryx" might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that "Archaeopteryx" used its wings mainly to escape <a href="Predation">predators</a> by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.

A <a href="histological">histological</a> study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that "Archaeopteryx" grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of "Archaeopteryx" bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates, poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of "Archaeopteryx" come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of "Archaeopteryx" could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in "Archaeopteryx". The poorly vascularized bone of "Archaeopteryx" might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how long it would take to "grow" each specimen of "Archaeopteryx" to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of . The study also found that the avialans "<a href="Jeholornis">Jeholornis</a>" and "<a href="Sapeornis">Sapeornis</a>" grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid "<a href="Mahakala%20%28dinosaur%29">Mahakala</a>". The avialans "<a href="Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a>" and "<a href="Ichthyornis">Ichthyornis</a>" grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>, and the authors speculated that "Archaeopteryx" and the kiwi had similar <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>.

Comparisons between the <a href="sclerotic%20ring">scleral ring</a>s of "Archaeopteryx" and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, similar to most modern birds.

The richness and diversity of the <a href="Solnhofen%20limestone">Solnhofen limestone</a>s in which all specimens of "Archaeopteryx" have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, although scarce, include <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, and "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>".

The excellent preservation of "Archaeopteryx" fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at <a href="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a> indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved. The "Archaeopteryx" specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away. "Archaeopteryx" skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found. The pterosaurs included species such as "<a href="Rhamphorhynchus%20%28pterosaur%29">Rhamphorhynchus</a>" belonging to the <a href="Rhamphorhynchidae">Rhamphorhynchidae</a>, the group which dominated the <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a> currently occupied by <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included "<a href="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a>", were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrants</a> from the larger islands to the north.

The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a>, and sub-<a href="tropical">tropical</a> with a long <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a> and little rain. The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be <a href="Orca%20Basin">Orca Basin</a> in the northern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, although it is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons. The <a href="flora">flora</a> of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low () shrubs. Contrary to reconstructions of "Archaeopteryx" climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree <a href="pollen">pollen</a> also is absent.

The lifestyle of "Archaeopteryx" is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal on the basis of the curvature of the claws which has since been questioned. The absence of trees does not preclude "Archaeopteryx" from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of "Archaeopteryx" point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.

Over the years, twelve body fossil specimens of "Archaeopteryx" and a feather that may belong to it have been found. All of the fossils come from the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> deposits, quarried for centuries, near <a href="Solnhofen">Solnhofen</a>, Germany.
The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Hermann von Meyer</a>. It is currently located at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20Berlin">Natural History Museum of Berlin</a>. This is generally assigned to "Archaeopteryx" and was the initial <a href="holotype">holotype</a>, but whether it is a feather of this species, or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the "typical" "A. lithographica").

The first skeleton, known as the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was unearthed in 1861 near <a href="Langenaltheim">Langenaltheim</a>, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> as "Archaeopteryx macrura", allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> described how some authors had maintained "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the "Archaeopteryx", with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world."

The <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> term "pteryx" () primarily means "wing", but can also designate merely "feather". Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's <a href="Flight%20feather">remex</a> (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the <a href="London">London</a> specimen, to which he referred as a ""Skelett eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten "" ("skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term "Schwinge" which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. "Urschwinge" was the favoured translation of "Archaeopteryx" among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, "ancient pinion" offers a rough approximation.

Since then twelve specimens have been recovered:

The Berlin Specimen (HMN 1880/81) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious <a href="fossil">fossil</a> for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann Dörr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein, the son of K. Häberlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">O. C. Marsh</a> of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>'s Peabody Museum, it eventually was bought for 20,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">Goldmark</a> by the Berlin's Natural History Museum, where it now is displayed. The transaction was financed by <a href="Ernst%20Werner%20von%20Siemens">Ernst Werner von Siemens</a>, founder of the <a href="Siemens%20AG">famous company</a> that bears his name. Described in 1884 by <a href="Wilhelm%20Dames">Wilhelm Dames</a>, it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species, "A. siemensii"; though often considered a synonym of "A. lithographica", several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens.

Composed of a torso, the <a href="Maxberg%20specimen">Maxberg Specimen</a> (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor <a href="Florian%20Heller">Florian Heller</a> in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the <a href="Maxberg%20Museum">Maxberg Museum</a> in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to <a href="Eduard%20Opitsch">Eduard Opitsch</a>, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it was discovered that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.

The Haarlem Specimen (TM 6428/29, also known as the "Teylers Specimen") was discovered in 1855 near <a href="Riedenburg">Riedenburg</a>, Germany, and described as a "<a href="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a> crassipes" in 1857 by Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> and is currently located at the <a href="Teylers%20Museum">Teylers Museum</a> in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen found, but was incorrectly classified at the time. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones, isolated cervical vertebrae, and ribs. In 2017 it was named as a separate genus "<a href="Ostromia">Ostromia</a>", considered more closely related to "<a href="Anchiornis">Anchiornis</a>" from China.

The Eichstätt Specimen (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by <a href="Peter%20Wellnhofer">Peter Wellnhofer</a> in 1974. Currently located at the <a href="Jura%20Museum">Jura Museum</a> in <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus ("Jurapteryx recurva") or species ("A. recurva").

The Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was discovered in the 1970s near <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the <a href="B%C3%BCrgermeister-M%C3%BCller-Museum">Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum</a> in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>" by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, "<a href="Wellnhoferia">Wellnhoferia</a> grandis". It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.

The Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, formerly known as the "Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen") was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the <a href="Pal%C3%A4ontologisches%20Museum%20M%C3%BCnchen">Paläontologisches Museum München</a> in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million <a href="Deutschmark">Deutschmark</a>. What was initially believed to be a bony <a href="sternum">sternum</a> turned out to be part of the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, but a <a href="cartilaginous">cartilaginous</a> sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It has been used as the basis for a distinct species, "A. bavarica", but more recent studies suggest it belongs to "A. siemensii".

An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990 in the younger <a href="M%C3%B6rnsheim%20Formation">Mörnsheim Formation</a> at <a href="Daiting">Daiting</a>, Suevia. Therefore, it is known as the Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a>. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of "Archaeopteryx" at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. The Daiting Specimen was subsequently named "Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi" by Kundrat et al. (2018).

Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and, since 2004, on loan to the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum in Solnhofen, so it is called the Bürgermeister-Müller Specimen; the institute itself officially refers to it as the "Exemplar of the families Ottman & Steil, Solnhofen". As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of "Archaeopteryx", the popular name of this fossil is "chicken wing".

Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the Thermopolis Specimen (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the <a href="Wyoming%20Dinosaur%20Center">Wyoming Dinosaur Center</a> in <a href="Thermopolis%2C%20Wyoming">Thermopolis, Wyoming</a>, it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The "Thermopolis" specimen was described in 2 December 2005 "Science" journal article as "A well-preserved "Archaeopteryx" specimen with theropod features"; it shows that "Archaeopteryx" lacked a reversed toe—a universal feature of birds—limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> ancestry. In 1988, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described. "Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs." The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to "Archaeopteryx siemensii" in 2007. The specimen is considered to represent the most complete and best-preserved "Archaeopteryx" remains yet.

The discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced in 2011, and it was described in 2014. It is one of the more complete specimens, but is missing much of the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name.
Palaeontologists of the <a href="Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a> studied the specimen, which revealed previously unknown features of the plumage, such as feathers on both the upper and lower legs and metatarsus, and the only preserved tail tip.

A twelfth specimen had been discovered by an amateur collector in 2010 at the Schamhaupten quarry, but the finding was only announced in February 2014. It was scientifically described in 2018. It represents a complete and mostly articulated skeleton with skull. It is the only specimen lacking preserved feathers. It is from the <a href="Painten%20Formation">Painten Formation</a> and somewhat older than the other specimens.

Today, fossils of the genus "Archaeopteryx" are usually assigned to one or two species, "A. lithographica" and "A. siemensii", but their taxonomic history is complicated. Ten names have been published for the handful of specimens. As interpreted today, the name "A. lithographica" only referred to the single feather described by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Meyer</a>. In 1954 <a href="Gavin%20de%20Beer">Gavin de Beer</a> concluded that the London specimen was the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name "Archaeopteryx lithographica" be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names "Griphosaurus" and "Griphornis" invalid. The <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a>, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens, which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent <a href="Johann%20Andreas%20Wagner">Johann Andreas Wagner</a> (whose "Griphosaurus problematicus" – "problematic <a href="riddle">riddle</a>-lizard" – was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's "Archaeopteryx"). In addition, in 1977, the Commission ruled that the first species name of the Haarlem specimen, "crassipes", described by Meyer as a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> before its true nature was realized, was not to be given preference over "lithographica" in instances where scientists considered them to represent the same species.

It has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of "Archaeopteryx" described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of "Archaeopteryx". It certainly is a <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a> of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of <a href="feathered%20dinosaur">feathered theropod</a>, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the <a href="Biological%20type">type specimen</a>, the name "Archaeopteryx" should then no longer be applied to the skeletons, thus creating significant <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">nomenclatorial</a> confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or <a href="neotype">neotype</a>. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.

Below is a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> published in 2013 by <a href="Pascal%20Godefroit">Godefroit</a> "et al."

It has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, "A. lithographica". Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as "Archaeornis siemensii", the Eichstätt specimen as "Jurapteryx recurva", the Munich specimen as "Archaeopteryx bavarica", and the Solnhofen specimen as "Wellnhoferia grandis".

In 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of "Archaeopteryx" could be supported: "A. lithographica" (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and "A. siemensii" (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in "A. lithographica" (the claws of "A. siemensii" specimens being relatively simple and straight). "A. lithographica" also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, "Wellnhoferia grandis" (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from "A. lithographica" except in its larger size.

If two names are given, the first denotes the original describer of the "species", the second the author on whom the given name combination is based. As always in <a href="zoological%20nomenclature">zoological nomenclature</a>, putting an author's name in parentheses denotes that the <a href="taxon">taxon</a> was originally described in a different genus.

""Archaeopteryx" vicensensis" (Anon. "fide" Lambrecht, 1933) is a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" for what appears to be an undescribed pterosaur.

Beginning in 1985, an amateur group including <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> and <a href="physicist">physicist</a> <a href="Lee%20Spetner">Lee Spetner</a> published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of "Archaeopteryx" were forged. Their claims were repudiated by <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> and others at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum in London</a>. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of <a href="lithification">lithification</a>; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of <a href="cement">cement</a>, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of "Archaeopteryx" known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.

They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the <a href="counterslab">counterslab</a>. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.

Finally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; one is that <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> wanted to forge evidence in support of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.

Charig "et al." pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner "et al." then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with <a href="calcite">calcite</a>, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through <a href="X-ray%20spectroscopy">X-ray spectroscopy</a>, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig "et al." reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.

Modern paleontology has often classified "Archaeopteryx" as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, "Archaeopteryx" was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether "Archaeopteryx" truly was the first bird. They suggested that "Archaeopteryx" was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that "<a href="Avimimus">Avimimus</a>" was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than "Archaeopteryx". Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.

The discovery of the closely related "<a href="Xiaotingia">Xiaotingia</a>" in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that "Archaeopteryx" is a <a href="deinonychosaur">deinonychosaur</a> rather than an avialan, and therefore, not a "bird" under most common uses of that term. A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found "Archaeopteryx" in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while "Xiaotingia" was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not "Archaeopteryx" is a member of Avialae or not, barring new and better specimens of relevant species.

Phylogenetic studies conducted by Senter, "et al." (2012) and Turner, Makovicky, and Norell (2012) confirmed that "Archaeopteryx" was more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit, "et al." (2013) recovered "Archaeopteryx" as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of "<a href="Eosinopteryx">Eosinopteryx brevipenna</a>". The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing "Xiaotingia", adding "<a href="Jinfengopteryx">Jinfengopteryx elegans</a>" and "Eosinopteryx brevipenna" to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of "Xiaotingia", the analysis conducted by Godefroit, "et al." did not find "Archaeopteryx" to be related particularly closely to "Anchiornis" and "Xiaotingia", which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.

Agnolín and Novas (2013) found "Archaeopteryx" and (possibly synonymous) "<a href="Wellnhoferia">Wellnhoferia</a>" to be the basalmost avialans (Avialae being defined by the authors as including "Archaeopteryx lithographica" and "<a href="Passer">Passer</a>", their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants), with <a href="Microraptoria">Microraptoria</a>, <a href="Unenlagiinae">Unenlagiinae</a>, and the clade containing "Anchiornis" and "Xiaotingia" being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, "et al.", using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of "Eosinopteryx brevipenna", also found "Archaeopteryx" to be a member of Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing "<a href="house%20sparrow">Passer domesticus</a>", but not "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus albertensis</a>" or "<a href="Troodon">Troodon formosus</a>"). "Archaeopteryx" was found to form a <a href="Evolutionary%20grade">grade</a> at the base of Avialae with "Xiaotingia", "Anchiornis", and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>". Compared to "Archaeopteryx", "Xiaotingia" was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both "Anchiornis" and "<a href="Aurornis">Aurornis</a>" were found to be more distantly so.

Bulgaria

Bulgaria (; ), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (, "", ), is a country in <a href="Southeast%20Europe">Southeast Europe</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Romania">Romania</a> to the north, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="North%20Macedonia">North Macedonia</a> to the west, <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the south, and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to the east. The capital and largest city is <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>; other major cities are <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, <a href="Varna">Varna</a> and <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's <a href="List%20of%20European%20countries%20by%20area">16th-largest country</a>. 

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="Karanovo%20culture">Karanovo culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, <a href="Persians">Persians</a>, <a href="Celts">Celts</a> and <a href="ancient%20Macedonians">ancient Macedonians</a>; stability came when the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading <a href="Bulgars">Bulgar</a> horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which dominated most of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and significantly influenced <a href="Slavs">Slavic</a> cultures by developing the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic script</a>. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20II">Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries.

The <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">one-party socialist state</a> and part of the Soviet-led <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. The ruling <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on power after the <a href="revolutions%20of%201989">revolutions of 1989</a> and allowed <a href="multi-party">multi-party</a> elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a <a href="democracy">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.

Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> has been a <a href="Unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="parliamentary%20republic">parliamentary republic</a> with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million lives mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Bulgaria">27 provinces</a>, and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s.

Bulgaria is a member of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, and the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>; it is a founding state of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> three times. Its <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> is part of the <a href="European%20Single%20Market">European Single Market</a> and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. <a href="Corruption%20in%20Bulgaria">Widespread corruption</a> is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union for 2018.

The name "Bulgaria" is derived from the "<a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>", a tribe of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> origin that founded the country. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD, but it is possibly derived from the <a href="Proto-Turkic">Proto-Turkic</a> word "bulģha" ("to mix", "shake", "stir") and its derivative "bulgak" ("revolt", "disorder"). The meaning may be further extended to "rebel", "incite" or "produce a state of disorder", i.e. the "disturbers". Ethnic groups in <a href="Inner%20Asia">Inner Asia</a> with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the <a href="Jie%20people">Buluoji</a>, a component of the "<a href="Five%20Barbarians">Five Barbarian</a>" groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a "mixed race" and "troublemakers".

<a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Paleolithic</a>, are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria. The <a href="Karanovo%20culture">Karanovo culture</a> arose circa 6,500 BC and was one of several <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> societies in the region that thrived on <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. The <a href="Copper%20Age">Copper Age</a> <a href="Varna%20culture">Varna culture</a> (fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing <a href="Goldsmith">gold metallurgy</a>. The associated <a href="Varna%20Necropolis">Varna Necropolis treasure</a> contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.

The <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>, appeared on the <a href="Balkans">Balkan Peninsula</a> some time before the 12th century BC. The Thracians excelled in <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and gave the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a> the <a href="Orpheus">Orphean</a> and <a href="Dionysus">Dionysian</a> cults, but remained tribal and stateless. The Persian <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> conquered most of present-day Bulgaria in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">479 BC</a>. The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king <a href="Teres%20I">Teres</a> to form the <a href="Odrysian%20kingdom">Odrysian kingdom</a> in the 470s BC. It was weakened and vassalized by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> in 341 BC, attacked <a href="Tylis">by Celts</a> in the 3rd century, and finally <a href="Thracia">became a province</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in AD 45.

By the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> began spreading in the region around the 4th century. The <a href="Gothic%20Bible">Gothic Bible</a>—the first <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic language</a> book—was created by <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> bishop <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a> in what is today northern Bulgaria around 381. The region came under <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> control after the <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">fall of Rome</a> in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions. This enabled the <a href="Early%20Slavs">Slavs</a> to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>. Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the <a href="Sclaveni">South Slavs</a>, who lived under a <a href="democracy">democracy</a>. The Slavs assimilated the partially <a href="Hellenistic%20period%23Balkans">Hellenized</a>, <a href="Thraco-Romans">Romanized</a>, and <a href="Thracian%20Goths">Gothicized</a> Thracians in the rural areas.

Not long after the Slavic incursion, <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> was once again invaded, this time by the <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a> under <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">Khan</a> <a href="Asparuh%20of%20Bulgaria">Asparukh</a>. Their horde was a remnant of <a href="Old%20Great%20Bulgaria">Old Great Bulgaria</a>, an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680. A peace treaty with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste.

Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. <a href="Krum%20of%20Bulgaria">Krum</a> introduced a written code of law and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pliska">Battle of Pliska</a>, in which Byzantine emperor <a href="Nicephorus%20I">Nicephorus I</a> was killed. <a href="Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris I</a> abolished paganism in favour of <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a> in 864. The <a href="Christianization%20of%20Bulgaria">conversion</a> was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian church</a> and the adoption of the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic alphabet</a>, developed in the capital, <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a>. The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic language</a>. A golden age began during the 34-year rule of <a href="Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon the Great</a>, who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.

After Simeon's death, Bulgaria was weakened by wars with <a href="Magyars">Magyars</a> and <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> and the spread of the <a href="Bogomilism">Bogomil heresy</a>. Preslav was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Rus'</a> and Byzantine invasions. The empire briefly recovered from the attacks under <a href="Samuel%20of%20Bulgaria">Samuil</a>, but this ended when Byzantine emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> defeated the Bulgarian army at <a href="battle%20of%20Kleidion">Klyuch</a> in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle, and by 1018 the Byzantines <a href="Byzantine%20conquest%20of%20Bulgaria">had conquered the First Bulgarian Empire</a>.

After the conquest of Bulgaria, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing <a href="tax%20in%20kind">tax in kind</a> instead. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Patriarchate</a> was reduced to an <a href="Orthodox%20Archbishopric%20of%20Ohrid%20%28ancient%29">archbishopric</a>, but retained its <a href="autocephaly">autocephalous status</a> and its <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s. Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, <a href="Bulgarian%20uprising%20against%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire%20%281040-1041%29">the largest</a> being led by <a href="Peter%20Delyan">Peter Delyan</a>. In 1185 <a href="Asen%20dynasty">Asen dynasty</a> nobles <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20I">Ivan Asen I</a> and <a href="Peter%20IV%20of%20Bulgaria">Peter IV</a> organized a <a href="Uprising%20of%20Asen%20and%20Peter">major uprising</a> which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Tarnovo</a> as the capital.

<a href="Kaloyan">Kaloyan</a>, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of <a href="the%20pope">the pope</a> and received a royal crown from a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>. The empire reached its zenith under <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20II">Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, Serbia and <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a>, while commerce and culture flourished. Ivan Asen's rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.

The Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks followed, enabling the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Mongols</a> to <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Bulgaria%20and%20Serbia">establish suzerainty</a> over the weakened Bulgarian state. In 1277, swineherd <a href="Ivaylo%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivaylo</a> led a <a href="Uprising%20of%20Ivaylo">great peasant revolt</a> that chased the Mongols out of Bulgaria and briefly made him emperor. He was overthrown in 1280 by <a href="boyars">the feudal landlords</a>, whose factional conflicts caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century. These fragmented <a href="rump%20state">rump state</a>s—two tsardoms at <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Vidin">Vidin</a> and <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire%23Ivan%20Alexander%20and%20fall%20of%20Bulgaria">Tarnovo</a> and the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Dobruja">Despotate of Dobrudzha</a>—became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the Southeast: the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a>.

The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan <a href="Murad%20I">Murad I</a> took <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> from the Byzantines in 1362; <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> fell in 1382, followed by <a href="Shumen">Shumen</a> in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</a> which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. <a href="Sozopol">Sozopol</a> was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was <a href="Serfdom">enserfed</a> to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.

<a href="Christians">Christians</a> were considered an <a href="rayah">inferior class</a> of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including <a href="devshirme">devshirme</a>, or "blood tax"), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial <a href="Islamisation">Islamisation</a>. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the <a href="Rum%20Millet">Rum Millet</a>, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Bulgaria">Catholic community</a> in the northwest of the country.

As Ottoman power began to wane, <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Austria</a> and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrians</a> first backed an <a href="First%20Tarnovo%20Uprising">uprising in Tarnovo in 1598</a>, then <a href="Second%20Tarnovo%20Uprising">a second one in 1686</a>, the <a href="Chiprovtsi%20Uprising">Chiprovtsi Uprising</a> in 1688 and finally <a href="Karposh%27s%20Rebellion">Karposh's Rebellion</a> in 1689. The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk%20Kaynarca">Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca</a> in 1774.

The Western European <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a <a href="national%20awakening%20of%20Bulgaria">national awakening of Bulgaria</a>. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 <a href="April%20Uprising">April Uprising</a>. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the <a href="Great%20Powers%23History">Great Powers</a> to take action. They convened the <a href="Constantinople%20Conference">Constantinople Conference</a> in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. In 1877 <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%2C%201877%E2%80%931878">Russia declared war</a> on the Ottomans and defeated them with the help of <a href="Opalchentsi">Bulgarian rebels</a>, particularly during the crucial <a href="Battle%20of%20Shipka%20Pass">Battle of Shipka Pass</a> which secured Russian control over the main road to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> was signed on 3 March 1878 by <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>, <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, roughly on the territories of the <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, and this day is now <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Bulgaria">a public holiday</a> called National Liberation Day. The other <a href="Great%20Powers%23History">Great Powers</a> immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%2C%201878">Treaty of Berlin</a>, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.

The Bulgarian principality won <a href="Serbo-Bulgarian%20War">a war against Serbia</a> and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of <a href="Eastern%20Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a> in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as "the Balkan <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a> and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. After a disastrous defeat in the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a>, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Doiran</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Monastir%20%281917%29">Monastir</a>, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories <a href="immigrated">immigrated</a> to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.
The resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarian dictatorship</a> by Tsar <a href="Boris%20III%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris III</a> (1918–1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of <a href="Axis%20Powers">the Axis</a> but declined to participate in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> and <a href="Rescue%20of%20the%20Bulgarian%20Jews">saved its Jewish population</a> from deportation to <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camps</a>. The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of <a href="Bogdan%20Filov">Bogdan Filov</a> subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944. The communist-dominated <a href="Fatherland%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Fatherland Front</a> took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended. Bulgaria suffered little war damage and the Soviet Union demanded no reparations. But all wartime gains, with the notable exception of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Craiova">Southern Dobrudzha</a>, were lost.

The <a href="Bulgarian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20of%201944">left-wing uprising</a> of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and <a href="People%27s%20Court%20%28Bulgaria%29">the executions</a> of some 1,000–3,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite. But it was not until 1946 that a <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="people%27s%20republic">people's republic</a> was instituted following a referendum. It fell into the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of <a href="Georgi%20Dimitrov">Georgi Dimitrov</a> (1946–1949), who established a repressive, rapidly industrializing <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> state. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly and political repressions eased. The Soviet-style <a href="planned%20economy">planned economy</a> saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">Todor Zhivkov</a> (1954–1989). Compared to wartime levels, national GDP increased five-fold and per capita GDP quadrupled by the 1980s, although severe debt spikes took place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. Zhivkov's daughter <a href="Lyudmila%20Zhivkova">Lyudmila</a> bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. Facing declining birth rates among the ethnic Bulgarian majority, in 1984 Zhivkov's government forced the minority ethnic <a href="Turks%20in%20Bulgaria">Turks</a> to adopt Slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them. These policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.

The Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">Revolutions of 1989</a>. Zhivkov resigned and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Communist Party, now rebranded as the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a>. A <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bulgaria">new constitution</a> that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status in 2003. It became a member of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in 2004 and participated in the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>. After several years of reforms it joined the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and <a href="European%20Single%20Market">single market</a> in 2007 despite Brussels' concerns about government corruption. Bulgaria hosted the 2018 <a href="Presidency%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Presidency of the Council of the European Union</a> at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia.

Bulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern <a href="Balkans">Balkan</a> peninsula, bordering five countries—<a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the south, <a href="North%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> to the west, and <a href="Romania">Romania</a> to the north. The land borders have a total length of , and the coastline has a length of . Its total area of ranks it as the world's 105th-largest country. Bulgaria's geographic coordinates are <a href="43rd%20parallel%20north">43° N</a> <a href="25th%20meridian%20east">25° E</a>. The most notable <a href="topographical">topographical</a> features are the <a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a>, the <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Balkan Mountains</a>, the <a href="Thracian%20Plain">Thracian Plain</a>, and the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a>. The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> defines the border with Romania. The <a href="Thracia">Thracia</a>n Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> and broadening as it reaches the <a href="Bulgarian%20Black%20Sea%20Coast">Black Sea coast</a>.

The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country. The mountainous southwest has two distinct alpine ranges—<a href="Rila">Rila</a> and <a href="Pirin">Pirin</a>, which border the lower but more extensive <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a> to the east. <a href="Musala">Musala</a>, at , is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkan peninsula, and the Black Sea coast is the country's lowest point. Plains occupy about one third of the territory, while plateaux and hills occupy 41%. Most rivers are short and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the <a href="Iskar%20%28river%29">Iskar</a>, has a length of . Other major rivers include the <a href="Struma%20River">Struma</a> and the <a href="Maritsa">Maritsa</a> in the south.

Bulgaria has a changeable climate, which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and continental air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains. Northern Bulgaria averages cooler, and registers more precipitation, than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is , while the highest is . <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> averages about per year, and varies from in <a href="Dobrudja">Dobrudja</a> to more than in the mountains. Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter.

The interaction of climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions has produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species.
Bulgaria's <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, one of the richest in Europe, <a href="List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20Bulgaria">is conserved</a> in three national parks, 11 nature parks, 10 <a href="biosphere%20reserve">biosphere reserve</a>s and 565 protected areas. Ninety-three of the 233 <a href="mammal">mammal</a> species of Europe are found in Bulgaria, along with 49% of <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> and 30% of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a> species. Overall, 41,493 plant and animal species are present. Larger mammals with sizable populations include <a href="deer">deer</a> (106,323 individuals), <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a>s (88,948), <a href="jackal">jackal</a>s (47,293) and <a href="fox">fox</a>es (32,326). <a href="Partridge">Partridge</a>s number some 328,000 individuals, making them the most widespread <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">gamebird</a>. A third of all nesting birds in Bulgaria can be found in <a href="Rila%20National%20Park">Rila National Park</a>, which also hosts Arctic and alpine species at high altitudes. Flora includes more than 3,800 vascular plant species of which 170 are <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger <a href="fungi">fungi</a> in Bulgaria by the Institute of Botany identifies more than 1,500 species. More than 35% of the land area is covered by forests.

In 1998, the Bulgarian government adopted the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources. Bulgaria has some of the largest <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory. It also achieved its <a href="Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> objective of reducing <a href="carbon%20dioxide%20emissions">carbon dioxide emissions</a> by 30% from 1990 to 2009.

Bulgaria ranks 30th in the 2018 <a href="Environmental%20Performance%20Index">Environmental Performance Index</a>, but scores low on air quality. <a href="Particulates">Particulate</a> levels are the highest in Europe, especially in urban areas affected by automobile traffic and coal-based power stations. One of these, the <a href="lignite">lignite</a>-fired <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritsa Iztok-2</a> station, is causing the highest damage to health and the environment in the European Union. Pesticide use in agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution. Water quality began to improve in 1998 and has maintained a trend of moderate improvement. Over 75% of surface rivers meet European standards for good quality.

Bulgaria is a <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> where the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bulgaria">prime minister</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a> and the most powerful executive position. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> for <a href="citizen">citizen</a>s at least 18 years old. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bulgaria">Constitution</a> also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national <a href="referendum">referenda</a>. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.

Unlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected <a href="President%20of%20Bulgaria">president</a> serves as <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the <a href="presidential%20veto">presidential veto</a> by a simple majority vote. Political parties gather in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Assembly</a>, a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.

Overall, Bulgaria displays a pattern of unstable governments. <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a> is serving his third term as prime minister since 2009, when his centre-right, pro-EU party <a href="GERB">GERB</a> won <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202009">the general election</a> and ruled as a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> with 117 seats in the National Assembly. His first government resigned on 20 February 2013 after <a href="Protests%20against%20the%20Borisov%20cabinet">nationwide protests</a> caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards, corruption and the perceived failure of the democratic system. The protest wave was notable for self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties.

The subsequent <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">snap elections in May</a> resulted in a narrow win for <a href="GERB">GERB</a>, but the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> eventually formed a government led by <a href="Plamen%20Oresharski">Plamen Oresharski</a> after Borisov failed to secure parliamentary support. The Oresharski government resigned in July 2014 amid continuing <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bulgarian%20protests%20against%20the%20Oresharski%20cabinet">large-scale protests</a>. A caretaker government took over and called the <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">October 2014 elections</a> which resulted in a third GERB victory, but a total of eight parties entered parliament. Borisov <a href="Second%20Borisov%20Government">formed a coalition</a> with several right-wing parties, but resigned again after the candidate backed by his party failed to win the <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 Presidential election</a>. The <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202017">March 2017 snap election</a> was again won by GERB, but with 95 seats in Parliament. They formed a coalition with the far-right <a href="United%20Patriots">United Patriots</a>, who hold 27 seats.

<a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government. Bulgaria is still <a href="Freedom%20in%20the%20World">listed as "Free"</a>, with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores. The <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a> defines it as a "Flawed democracy".

Bulgaria has a <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> legal system. The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. The legal system is regarded by both domestic and international observers as one of Europe's most inefficient due to pervasive lack of transparency and corruption. Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Bulgaria%29">Ministry of the Interior</a>. The <a href="National%20Police%20Service%20%28Bulgaria%29">General Directorate of National Police</a> (GDNP) combats general crime and maintains public order. GDNP fields 26,578 police officers in its local and national sections. The bulk of criminal cases are transport-related, followed by <a href="theft">theft</a> and drug-related crime; <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20intentional%20homicide%20rate">homicide rates are low</a>. The Ministry of the Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the <a href="Gendarmerie%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Gendarmerie</a>—a specialized branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security.

Bulgaria is a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary state</a>. Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces ("oblasti", singular "<a href="oblast">oblast</a>"). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralization of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces are subdivided into 264 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Bulgaria">municipalities</a>. Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly <a href="centralization">centralized</a> state where the <a href="Government%20of%20Bulgaria">Council of Ministers</a> directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.

Bulgaria became a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">Security Council</a> three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003. It was also among the founding nations of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) in 1975. Euro-Atlantic integration has been a priority since the fall of communism, although the communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the <a href="European%20Communities">European Communities</a> by 1987. Bulgaria signed the European Union <a href="Treaty%20of%20Accession%202005">Treaty of Accession</a> on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. In addition, it has a tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, good ties with China and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and a historical relationship with <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.
Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of both civilian and military advisors in Soviet-allied countries like <a href="Nicaraguan%20Revolution">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="Great%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Libyan%20Arab%20Jamahiriya">Libya</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The first deployment of foreign troops on Bulgarian soil since World War II occurred in 2001, when the country hosted six <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135 Stratotanker</a> aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan. International military relations were further expanded with accession to <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in March 2004 and the US-Bulgarian Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in April 2006. <a href="Bezmer%20Air%20Base">Bezmer</a> and <a href="Graf%20Ignatievo%20Air%20Base">Graf Ignatievo</a> air bases, the <a href="Novo%20Selo%20Range">Novo Selo</a> training range, and a logistics centre in <a href="Aytos%20Logistics%20Center">Aytos</a> subsequently became <a href="List%20of%20joint%20US-Bulgarian%20military%20bases">joint military training facilities</a> cooperatively used by the United States and Bulgarian militaries.

Domestic defence is the responsibility of the all-<a href="volunteer%20military">volunteer</a> <a href="Bulgarian%20armed%20forces">Bulgarian armed forces</a>, composed of <a href="Bulgarian%20land%20forces">land forces</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20Navy">navy</a> and an <a href="Bulgarian%20Air%20Force">air force</a>. The land forces consist of two mechanized brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons. Active troops dwindled from 152,000 in 1988 to 31,300 in 2017, supplemented by 3,000 reservists and 16,000 paramilitary. The inventory consists mostly of Soviet equipment like <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">Mikoyan MiG-29</a> and <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-25">Sukhoi Su-25</a> jets, <a href="S-300%20missile%20system">S-300PT</a> air defence systems and <a href="SS-21%20Scarab">SS-21 Scarab</a> short-range <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>s.

Bulgaria has an open, <a href="developing%20country">upper middle income</a> range <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> where the private sector accounts for more than 70% of GDP. From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities. The loss of <a href="COMECON">COMECON</a> markets in 1990 and the subsequent "<a href="Shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29">shock therapy</a>" of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later, but the average salary of 1,036 leva ($615) per month remains the lowest in the EU. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> of $1.16 per hour.

A <a href="balanced%20budget">balanced budget</a> was achieved in 2003 and the country began running a <a href="budget%20surplus">surplus</a> the following year. Expenditures amounted to $21.15 billion and revenues were $21.67 billion in 2017. Most government spending on institutions is earmarked for security. The ministries of defence, the interior and justice are allocated the largest share of the annual government budget, whereas those responsible for the environment, tourism and energy receive the least amount of funding. Taxes form the bulk of government revenue at 30% of GDP. Bulgaria has some of the lowest corporate income <a href="Tax%20rates%20in%20Europe">tax rates in the EU</a> at a flat 10% rate. The tax system is two-tier. <a href="Value%20added%20tax">Value added tax</a>, <a href="excise%20duties">excise duties</a>, corporate and personal income tax are national, whereas real estate, inheritance, and vehicle taxes are levied by local authorities. Strong economic performance in the early 2000s reduced <a href="government%20debt">government debt</a> from 79.6% in 1998 to 14.1% in 2008. It has since increased to 28.7% of GDP by 2016, but remains the third lowest in the EU.

The <a href="Yugozapaden">Yugozapaden</a> <a href="First-level%20NUTS%20of%20the%20European%20Union">planning area</a> is the most developed region with a <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a> gross domestic product (<a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>) of $26,580 in 2016. It includes the capital city and the surrounding <a href="Sofia%20Province">Sofia Province</a>, which alone generate 42% of national gross domestic product despite hosting only 22% of the population. PPP <a href="GDP">GDP</a> per capita and the cost of living in 2017 stood at 49 and 48.4% of the EU average, respectively. National PPP GDP was estimated at $143.1 billion in 2016, with a per capita value of $20,116. Economic growth statistics take into account illegal transactions from the <a href="informal%20economy">informal economy</a>, which is the largest in the EU as a percentage of economic output. The <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Bank">Bulgarian National Bank</a> issues the national currency, <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">lev</a>, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 levа per euro.

After several consecutive years of high growth, repercussions of the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a> resulted in a 3.6% contraction of GDP in 2009 and increased unemployment. Industrial output declined 10%, mining by 31%, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60% drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010 but intercompany debt exceeded $59 billion, meaning that 60% of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to $97 billion, or 227% of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures, such as increased <a href="economic%20inequality">income inequality</a> and accelerated outward migration, have been "catastrophic" according to the <a href="International%20Trade%20Union%20Confederation">International Trade Union Confederation</a>.

Siphoning of public funds to the families and relatives of politicians from incumbent parties has resulted in fiscal and welfare losses to society. Bulgaria ranks 71st in the <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> and experiences the worst levels of <a href="corruption">corruption</a> in the European Union, a phenomenon that remains a source of profound public discontent. Along with organized crime, corruption has resulted in a rejection of the country's <a href="Schengen%20Area">Schengen Area</a> application and withdrawal of foreign investment. Government officials reportedly engage in embezzlement, influence trading, government procurement violations and bribery with impunity. Government procurement in particular is a critical area in corruption risk. An estimated 10 billion leva ($5.99 billion) of state budget and <a href="Structural%20Funds%20and%20Cohesion%20Fund">European cohesion</a> funds are spent on public tenders each year; nearly 14 billion ($8.38 billion) were spent on public contracts in 2017 alone. A large share of these contracts are awarded to a few politically connected companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made award criteria. Despite repeated criticism from the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>, EU institutions refrain from taking measures against Bulgaria because it supports Brussels on a number of issues, unlike <a href="Poland">Poland</a> or <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>.

The labour force is 3.36 million people, of whom 6.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.6% in industry and 66.6% in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of <a href="chemical%20industry">chemicals</a>, <a href="machinery%20industry">machine building</a>, steel, biotechnology, tobacco and food processing and <a href="refined%20petroleum%20fuel">petroleum refining</a> are among the major industrial activities. Mining alone employs 24,000 people and generates about 5% of the country's GDP; the number of employed in all mining-related industries is 120,000. Bulgaria is Europe's fifth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors.

Two-thirds of food and agricultural exports go to <a href="OECD">OECD</a> countries. Although cereal and vegetable output dropped by 40% between 1990 and 2008, output has since increased, and the 2016–2017 season registered the biggest grain output in a decade. <a href="Maize">Maize</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="oats">oats</a> and <a href="rice">rice</a> are also grown. Quality <a href="Turkish%20tobacco">Oriental tobacco</a> is a significant industrial crop. Bulgaria is also the largest producer globally of <a href="lavender%20oil">lavender</a> and <a href="rose%20oil">rose oil</a>, both widely used in fragrances. Of the services sector, <a href="Tourism%20in%20Bulgaria">tourism</a> is a significant contributor to economic growth. Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. Most of the visitors are Romanian, German, Turkish, British and Russian. <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Veliko Tarnovo</a>, coastal resorts <a href="Golden%20Sands">Golden Sands</a> and <a href="Sunny%20Beach">Sunny Beach</a> and winter resorts <a href="Bansko">Bansko</a>, <a href="Pamporovo">Pamporovo</a> and <a href="Borovets">Borovets</a> are some of the locations most visited by tourists.

Spending on <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> amounts to 0.78% of GDP, and the bulk of public R&D funding goes to the <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> (BAS). Private businesses accounted for more than 73% of R&D expenditures and employed 42% of Bulgaria's 22,000 researchers in 2015. The same year, Bulgaria ranked 39th out of 50 countries in the <a href="Bloomberg%20Innovation%20Index">Bloomberg Innovation Index</a>, the highest score being in education (24th) and the lowest in value-added manufacturing (48th). Chronic government underinvestment in research since 1990 has forced many professionals in science and engineering to leave Bulgaria.
Despite the lack of funding, research in chemistry, <a href="materials%20science">materials science</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a> remains strong. Three per cent of economic output is generated by the <a href="information%20and%20communication%20technologies">information and communication technologies</a> (ICT) sector where 40,000 to 51,000 software engineers are employed. Bulgaria was known as a "Communist <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>" during the Soviet era due to its key role in <a href="COMECON">COMECON</a> computing technology production. The country is a regional leader in <a href="supercomputer">high performance computing</a> and operates "Avitohol", the most powerful supercomputer in Southeast Europe.

Bulgaria has made numerous contributions to <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a>. These include two scientific satellites, more than 200 payloads and 300 experiments in Earth orbit, as well as <a href="Bulgarian%20cosmonaut%20program">two cosmonauts</a> since 1971. Bulgaria was the first country to grow <a href="wheat">wheat</a> and vegetables <a href="Plants%20in%20space">in space</a> with its <a href="SVET%20plant%20growth%20system">Svet</a> <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>s on the <a href="Mir%20space%20station">Mir space station</a>. It was involved in the development of the <a href="Granat">Granat</a> <a href="Gamma-ray%20astronomy">gamma-ray observatory</a> and the <a href="Vega%20program">Vega program</a>, particularly in modelling trajectories and guidance <a href="algorithms">algorithms</a> for both Vega probes. Bulgarian instruments have been used in the <a href="exploration%20of%20Mars">exploration of Mars</a>, including a spectrometer that took the first high quality <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> images of Martian moon <a href="Phobos%20%28moon%29">Phobos</a> with the <a href="Phobos%202">Phobos 2</a> probe. <a href="Cosmic%20ray">Cosmic radiation</a> en route to and around the planet has been mapped by <a href="Liulin%20type%20instruments">Liulin-ML</a> dosimeters on the <a href="ExoMars%20Trace%20Gas%20Orbiter">ExoMars TGO</a>. <a href="RADOM-7">Variants</a> of these instruments have also been fitted to the <a href="Chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan-1</a> lunar probe and the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>. Bulgaria's first <a href="Geosynchronous%20satellite">geostationary communications satellite</a>—<a href="BulgariaSat-1">BulgariaSat-1</a>—was launched by <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> in June 2017.

Bulgaria is actively involved in <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> research, carried out mostly from its scientific base <a href="St.%20Kliment%20Ohridski%20Base">St. Kliment Ohrdiski</a> situated on <a href="Livingston%20Island">Livingston Island</a> in <a href="Western%20Antarctica">Western Antarctica</a>. 

Telephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions. <a href="Vivacom">Vivacom</a> (BTC) serves more than 90% of fixed lines and is one of the three operators providing mobile services, along with <a href="Mtel%20%28Bulgaria%29">A1</a> and <a href="Telenor%20%28Bulgaria%29">Telenor</a>. <a href="Internet">Internet</a> penetration stood at 61.9% of the population aged 16–74, in 2017.

Bulgaria's strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Thermal power plants generate 48.9% of electricity, followed by <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> from the <a href="Kozloduy%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Kozloduy reactors</a> (34.8%) and <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable sources</a> (16.3%). Equipment for a second nuclear power station at <a href="Belene%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Belene</a> has been acquired, but the fate of the project remains uncertain. Installed capacity amounts to 12,668 MW, allowing Bulgaria to exceed domestic demand and export energy.

The national road network has a total length of , of which are paved. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has of railway track and currently a total of of <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed lines</a> are in operation. Rail links are available with Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Serbia, and express trains serve direct routes to <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Sofia and Plovdiv are the country's air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports.

The population of Bulgaria is people according to the 2011 national census. The majority of the population, or 72.5%, reside in urban areas. , Sofia is the most populated urban centre with people, followed by <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> (345,000), <a href="Varna">Varna</a> (344,000), <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a> (209,000) and <a href="Ruse%2C%20Bulgaria">Ruse</a> (160,000). <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> are the main ethnic group and comprise 84.8% of the population. <a href="Turks%20in%20Bulgaria">Turkish</a> and <a href="Roma%20in%20Bulgaria">Roma</a> minorities comprise 8.8 and 4.9%, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities comprise 0.7%, and 0.8% do not self-identify with an ethnic group. Former <a href="National%20Statistical%20Institute%20%28Bulgaria%29">Statistics</a> head <a href="Reneta%20Indzhova">Reneta Indzhova</a> has disputed the 2011 census figures, suggesting the actual population is smaller than reported. The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data and may represent up to 11% of the population. Population density is 65 per square kilometre, almost half the European Union average.

Bulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The <a href="total%20fertility%20rate">total fertility rate</a> (TFR) was estimated at 1.46 children born per woman in 2017. The majority of children are born to unmarried women. Furthermore, a third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5% of families do not have children under the age of 16. The resulting birth rates are among the lowest in the world while <a href="death%20rate">death rate</a>s are among the highest.

High death rates result from a combination of an ageing population, a high number of people at risk of poverty and a weak healthcare system. More than 80% of all deaths are due to <a href="cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="cardiovascular%20conditions">cardiovascular conditions</a>; nearly a fifth of those are avoidable. Mortality rates can be sharply reduced to levels below the EU average through timely and adequate access to medical services, which the healthcare system does not provide fully. Although <a href="healthcare%20in%20Bulgaria">healthcare in Bulgaria</a> is nominally universal, <a href="out-of-pocket%20expenses">out-of-pocket expenses</a> account for nearly half of all healthcare spending, which significantly limits access to medical care. Other problems disrupting care provision are the emigration of doctors due to low wages, understaffed and under-equipped regional hospitals, supply shortages and frequent changes to the basic service package for those insured. The 2018 Bloomberg Health Care Efficiency Index ranked Bulgaria last out of 56 countries. Average <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> is 74.7 years compared with an EU average of 80.2 and a world average of 69.

Public expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well. Educational standards <a href="Education%20in%20Bulgaria">were once high</a>, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average <a href="literacy">literacy</a> stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, <a href="functional%20illiteracy">functional illiteracy</a> is significant. The <a href="Programme%20for%20International%20Student%20Assessment">PISA</a> study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20and%20Science%20%28Bulgaria%29">Ministry of Education and Science</a> partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. Higher education consists of a 4-year <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor</a> degree and a 1-year master's degree. Bulgaria's highest-ranked higher education institution is <a href="Sofia%20University">Sofia University</a>.

<a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a> is the only language with official status and native for % of the population. It belongs to the <a href="Slavic%20group%20of%20languages">Slavic group of languages</a>, but it has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a>, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in <a href="evidentiality">evidentiality</a>), the absence of <a href="noun%20cases">noun cases</a> and <a href="infinitives">infinitives</a>, and the use of a suffixed <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a>. Other major languages are <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> and <a href="Romani%20language">Romani</a>, which according to the 2011 census were spoken natively by 9.1% and 4.2% respectively.

The country scores high in <a href="gender%20equality">gender equality</a>, ranking 18th in the 2018 <a href="Global%20Gender%20Gap%20Report">Global Gender Gap Report</a>. Although <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> was enabled relatively late, in 1937, women today have equal political rights, high workforce participation and legally mandated <a href="Equal%20pay%20for%20equal%20work">equal pay</a>. Bulgaria has the highest ratio of female ICT researchers in the EU, as well as the second-highest ratio of females in the technology sector at 44.6% of the workforce. High levels of female participation are a legacy of the Socialist era. 

More than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>. <a href="Sunni%20Muslims">Sunni Muslims</a> are the second-largest religious community and constitute 10% of Bulgaria's overall religious makeup, although a majority of them are not observant and find the use of <a href="Islamic%20veil">Islamic veil</a>s in schools unacceptable. Less than 3% of the population are affiliated with <a href="Religion%20in%20Bulgaria">other religions</a> and 11.8% are irreligious or do not self-identify with a religion. The <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</a> gained <a href="autocephalous">autocephalous</a> status in AD 927, and has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests. Bulgaria is a <a href="secular%20state">secular state</a> with guaranteed religious freedom by constitution, but Orthodoxy is designated as a "traditional" religion.

Contemporary Bulgarian culture blends the formal culture that helped forge a national consciousness towards the end of Ottoman rule with millennia-old folk traditions. An essential element of Bulgarian folklore is fire, used to banish evil spirits and illnesses. Many of these are personified as witches, whereas other creatures like <a href="Slavic%20dragon">zmey</a> and <a href="samodiva%20%28mythology%29">samodiva</a> (<a href="Supernatural%20beings%20in%20Slavic%20folklore">veela</a>) are either benevolent guardians or ambivalent tricksters. Some rituals against evil spirits have survived and are still practised, most notably <a href="kukeri">kukeri</a> and <a href="survakane">survakari</a>. <a href="Martenitsa">Martenitsa</a> is also widely celebrated. <a href="Nestinarstvo">Nestinarstvo</a>, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of <a href="UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists">UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage</a>.

<a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Bulgaria">Nine historical and natural objects</a> are <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>s: <a href="Pirin%20National%20Park">Pirin National Park</a>, <a href="Srebarna%20Nature%20Reserve">Sreburna Nature Reserve</a>, the <a href="Madara%20Rider">Madara Rider</a>, the Thracian tombs in <a href="Thracian%20Tomb%20of%20Sveshtari">Sveshtari</a> and <a href="Thracian%20Tomb%20of%20Kazanlak">Kazanlak</a>, the <a href="Rila%20Monastery">Rila Monastery</a>, the <a href="Boyana%20Church">Boyana Church</a>, the <a href="Rock-hewn%20Churches%20of%20Ivanovo">Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo</a> and the ancient city of <a href="Nesebar">Nesebar</a>. The Rila Monastery was established by Saint <a href="John%20of%20Rila">John of Rila</a>, Bulgaria's <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a>, whose life has been the subject of numerous literary accounts since Medieval times.

The establishment of the <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav</a> and <a href="Ohrid%20Literary%20School">Ohrid</a> literary schools in the 10th century is associated with a golden period in Bulgarian literature during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The schools' emphasis on Christian <a href="religious%20text">scriptures</a> made the Bulgarian Empire a centre of Slavic culture, bringing Slavs under the influence of Christianity and providing them with <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">a written language</a>. Its alphabet, <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> script, was developed by the Preslav Literary School. The <a href="Tarnovo%20Literary%20School">Tarnovo Literary School</a>, on the other hand, is associated with a Silver age of literature defined by high-quality manuscripts on historical or mystical themes under the <a href="Asen%20dynasty">Asen</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Shishman">Shishman</a> dynasties. Many literary and artistic masterpieces were destroyed by the Ottoman conquerors, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Revival">National Revival</a> in the 19th century. The enormous body of work of <a href="Ivan%20Vazov">Ivan Vazov</a> (1850–1921) covered every genre and touched upon every facet of Bulgarian society, bridging pre-Liberation works with literature of the newly established state. Notable later works are "<a href="Bay%20Ganyo">Bay Ganyo</a>" by <a href="Aleko%20Konstantinov">Aleko Konstantinov</a>, the <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Nietzschean</a> poetry of <a href="Pencho%20Slaveykov">Pencho Slaveykov</a>, the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> poetry of <a href="Peyo%20Yavorov">Peyo Yavorov</a> and <a href="Dimcho%20Debelyanov">Dimcho Debelyanov</a>, the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a>-inspired works of <a href="Geo%20Milev">Geo Milev</a> and <a href="Nikola%20Vaptsarov">Nikola Vaptsarov</a>, and the <a href="Socialist%20Realism">Socialist realism</a> novels of <a href="Dimitar%20Dimov">Dimitar Dimov</a> and <a href="Dimitar%20Talev">Dimitar Talev</a>. <a href="Tzvetan%20Todorov">Tzvetan Todorov</a> is a notable contemporary author, while Bulgarian-born <a href="Elias%20Canetti">Elias Canetti</a> was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 1981.
А religious visual arts heritage includes <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es, <a href="mural">mural</a>s and <a href="icon">icon</a>s, many produced by the medieval <a href="Painting%20of%20the%20Tarnovo%20Artistic%20School">Tarnovo Artistic School</a>. Like literature, it was not until the National Revival when Bulgarian visual arts began to reemerge. <a href="Zahari%20Zograf">Zahari Zograf</a> was a pioneer of the visual arts in the pre-Liberation era. After the Liberation, <a href="Ivan%20Mrkvi%C4%8Dka">Ivan Mrkvička</a>, <a href="Anton%20Mitov">Anton Mitov</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Dimitrov">Vladimir Dimitrov</a>, <a href="Tsanko%20Lavrenov">Tsanko Lavrenov</a> and <a href="Zlatyu%20Boyadzhiev">Zlatyu Boyadzhiev</a> introduced newer styles and substance, depicting scenery from Bulgarian villages, old towns and historical subjects. <a href="Christo">Christo</a> is the most famous Bulgarian artist of the 21st century, known for his outdoor installations.

Folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes. Bulgarian folk music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as <a href="gadulka">gadulka</a>, <a href="gaida">gaida</a>, <a href="kaval">kaval</a> and <a href="davul">tupan</a>. A distinguishing feature is "extended rhythmical time", which has no equivalent in the rest of European music. The <a href="Bulgarian%20State%20Television%20Female%20Vocal%20Choir">State Television Female Vocal Choir</a> won a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in 1990 for its performances of Bulgarian folk music.

Since then, <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a> has deteriorated to the point where Bulgaria scores 111th globally in the World Press Freedom Index, lower than all European Union members and membership candidate states. The government has diverted EU funds to sympathetic media outlets and bribed others to be less critical on problematic topics, while attacks against individual journalists have increased. Collusion between politicians, oligarchs and the media is widespread.

Belarus

Belarus (; , ), officially the Republic of Belarus (, ), formerly known by its <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> name Byelorussia or Belorussia (), is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> bordered by <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the northeast, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> to the south, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> to the west, and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>. Over 40% of its is forested. Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the <a href="Principality%20of%20Polotsk">Principality of Polotsk</a> (11th to 14th centuries), the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>.

In the aftermath of the 1917 <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, Belarus declared independence as the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a>, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The <a href="Socialist%20Soviet%20Republic%20of%20Byelorussia">Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia</a> became a founding <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">constituent republic of the Soviet Union</a> in 1922 and was renamed as the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> were reintegrated into it after the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a>, and were finalized after World War II. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, along with the Soviet Union and the <a href="Ukrainian%20SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a>.

The parliament of the republic proclaimed the <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of Belarus on 1990, and during the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, Belarus declared independence on 1991. <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has served as the country's first president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled "Europe's last dictatorship" by some Western journalists, on account of Lukashenko's self-described <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> style of government. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as <a href="state%20ownership">state ownership</a> of large sections of the <a href="Economy%20of%20Belarus">economy</a>. <a href="Elections%20in%20Belarus">Elections under Lukashenko's rule</a> have been widely criticized as unfair; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus is also the last country in Europe using the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Belarus">death penalty</a>. Belarus's <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a> rating is the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as "not free" by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>, as "repressed" in the <a href="Index%20of%20Economic%20Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>, and is rated as by far the worst country for <a href="press%20freedom">press freedom</a> in Europe in the <a href="Press%20Freedom%20Index">2013–14 Press Freedom Index</a> published by <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, which ranks Belarus 157th out of 180 nations.

In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the <a href="Union%20State">Union State</a>. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic <a href="Belarusians">Belarusian</a>, with sizable minorities of <a href="Russians">Russians</a>, <a href="Poles">Poles</a> and <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a>. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution of Belarus</a> does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is <a href="Belarusian%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a>. The second-most widespread religion, <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Belarus">Roman Catholicism</a>, has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Belarus">national holidays</a>. Belarus is a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> since its founding, the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>, <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organization">CSTO</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Union">EEU</a>, and the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> but nevertheless maintains a <a href="Belarus%E2%80%93European%20Union%20relations">bilateral relationship with the organisation</a>, and likewise participates in two EU projects: the <a href="Eastern%20Partnership">Eastern Partnership</a> and the <a href="Baku%20Initiative">Baku Initiative</a>.

The name "Belarus" is closely related with the term "Belaya Rus", i.e., "<a href="White%20Rus%27">White Rus'</a>". There are several claims to the origin of the name "White Rus'." An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>n lands within the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> that had been populated mostly by <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> who had been Christianized early, as opposed to <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a>, which was predominantly inhabited by pagan <a href="Balts">Balts</a>.

An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population. A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a> (i.e., Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mogilev) had been referred to as "White Rus'".

The name "Rus" is often conflated with its Latin forms "Russia" and "Ruthenia", thus Belarus is often referred to as "White Russia" or "White Ruthenia". The name first appeared in <a href="Medieval%20German%20literature">German</a> and <a href="Medieval%20Latin%20literature">Latin</a> <a href="medieval%20literature">medieval literature</a>; the chronicles of <a href="Jan%20of%20Czarnk%C3%B3w">Jan of Czarnków</a> mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke <a href="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> and his mother at "" in 1381. In some languages, including German, Afrikaans and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, the country is generally called "White Russia" to this day (' and ' respectively).

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VI">Pope Pius VI</a> in 1783 to recognize the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> there, exclaiming "." The first known use of "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir <a href="Jerome%20Horsey">Jerome Horsey</a>, who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court. During the 17th century, the Russian <a href="tsar">tsar</a>s used "White Rus" to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
The term "Belorussia" (, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, "Russia") first rose in the days of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "the Tsar of All the Russias", as "Russia" or the "Russian Empire" was formed by three parts of Russia—the <a href="Great%20Russia">Great</a>, <a href="Little%20Russia">Little</a>, and <a href="White%20Ruthenia">White</a>. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.

After the <a href="Bolshevik%20Revolution">Bolshevik Revolution</a> in 1917, the term "White Russia" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term "Byelorussia" was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, "Byelorussia" became commonly used in the regions of <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a> and <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a> during the interwar period.

The term "Byelorussia" (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Soviet</a> of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called "Republic of Belarus" ( spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be "Belarus". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian language</a> forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution of Belarus</a>.

Accordingly, the name "Byelorussia" was replaced by "Belarus" in English. Likewise, the adjective "Belorussian" or "Byelorussian" was replaced by "Belarusian" in English. "Belarusian" is closer to the original Belarusian term of '. Belarusian intelligentsia in the <a href="Stalin%20era">Stalin era</a> attempted to change the name from "Byelorussia" to a form of "Krivia" because of the supposed connection with Russia. Some nationalists object to the name for the same reason. Several local newspapers kept the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper. Also, those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use "Belorussia". Officially, the full name of the country is "Republic of Belarus" (, , ).

From 5000 to 2000 BC, <a href="Bandkeramik">Bandkeramik</a> cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the <a href="Dnieper-Donets%20culture">Dnieper-Donets culture</a> were found in Belarus and parts of <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the <a href="Huns">Huns</a> and <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by <a href="Baltic%20peoples">Baltic</a> tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.

In the 9th century the territory of modern Belarus became part of <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, a vast East Slavic state ruled by the <a href="Rurikid">Rurikid</a> dynasty. Upon the death of Kievan Rus' ruler <a href="Yaroslav%20I%20the%20Wise">Yaroslav I the Wise</a>, the state split into independent principalities. Many early Rus' principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus%27">Mongol invasion</a> in the 13th century, but the lands of modern Belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and were eventually joined the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>.
There are no sources of military seizure, but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of Polotsk and Lithuania for decades. For example, the Chronicle of Novgorod informs about "Izyaslav had been set to be Knyaz in Luki and covered Novgorod from the Lithuanians" in 1198 when Luki is situated on the east from Polotsk.

Incorporation into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania resulted in an economic, political and ethno-cultural unification of Belarusian lands. Of the principalities held by the Duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people. During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting on the side of Poland against the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> in 1410; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe.

The <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow">Muscovites</a>, led by <a href="Ivan%20III%20of%20Russia">Ivan III of Moscow</a>, began military campaigns in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the lands of Kievan Rus', specifically the territories of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281025%E2%80%931385%29">Kingdom of Poland</a> were joined in a <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> through a <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">marriage of their rulers</a>. This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, created in 1569 by the <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">Union of Lublin</a>.

The Lithuanian nobles were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from <a href="Muscovy">Muscovy</a>.
To strengthen the independence in the format of the union, three editions of the <a href="Statutes%20of%20Lithuania">Statutes of Lithuania</a> were issued in the 16th century. 
The third Article of the Statute establishes that all lands of Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never enter as a part of other states. It allowed to own the land within Grand Duchy of Lithuania only to own families. Anyone from outside Duchy would be honored with property only own it after swearing to Grand Duke of Lithuania. These articles were aimed to defend the rights of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania nobility against Polish, Prussian and other aristocracy of <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>.

In the years following the union, the process of gradual <a href="Polonization">Polonization</a> of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the <a href="Polish%20language">Polish language</a> and <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Ruthenian as the official language—with the Ruthenian language being banned from administrative use. However, the Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the <a href="Belarusian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Belarusian Greek Catholic Church</a>. Statutes were initially only issued in <a href="Ruthenian%20language">Ruthenian language</a> and later also in Polish. Around 1840 the Statutes were banned by the Russian tsar following the <a href="November%20Uprising">November Uprising</a>. Modern Ukrainian lands used it until 1860s.

The union between Poland and Lithuania ended in 1795 with the <a href="Third%20Partition%20of%20Poland">Third Partition of Poland</a> by Imperial Russia, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austria</a>. The Belarusian territories acquired by the Russian Empire under the reign of <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a> were included into the <a href="Belarusian%20Governorate">Belarusian Governorate</a> () in 1796 and held until their occupation by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Under <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a> and <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III</a> the national cultures were repressed. Policies of <a href="Polonization">Polonization</a> changed by <a href="Russification">Russification</a>, which included the return to <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christianity</a> of Belorusian <a href="Union%20of%20Brest">Uniates</a>. Belarusian language was banned in schools while in neighboring <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a> primary school education with <a href="Samogitian%20dialect">Samogitian</a> literacy was allowed.

In a <a href="Russification">Russification</a> drive in the 1840s, <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a> prohibited use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a <a href="January%20Uprising">revolt</a>, led by <a href="Konstanty%20Kalinowski">Konstanty Kalinowski</a>. After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic</a> to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.

During the negotiations of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk%20%28Russia%E2%80%93Central%20Powers%29">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>, Belarus first declared independence under German occupation on 1918, forming the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a>. Immediately afterwards, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> ignited, and the territory of Belarus was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia.
The Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic exists as a <a href="government%20in%20exile">government in exile</a> ever since then; in fact, it is currently the world's longest serving government in exile.

The Belarusian People's Republic was the first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under name "Belarus". Despite significant efforts the state ceased to exist, primarily due to the fact that the territory was continually dominated by the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Army">German Imperial Army</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and than the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>. It existed only from 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the name "Belarus". The choice of the name was probably based the fact that the educated core of the newly formed government was educated in the tsardom universities, with a corresponding education around the ideology of West-Russianism.

The <a href="Republic%20of%20Central%20Lithuania">Republic of Central Lithuania</a> was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following <a href="%C5%BBeligowski%27s%20Mutiny">the staged rebellion</a> of soldiers of the <a href="1st%20Lithuanian%E2%80%93Belarusian%20Division">1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division</a> of the <a href="Polish%20Army">Polish Army</a> under <a href="Lucjan%20%C5%BBeligowski">Lucjan Żeligowski</a>. Centered on the historical capital of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, <a href="Vilna">Vilna</a> (, ), for 18 months the entity served as a <a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a> between <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. After a variety of delays, <a href="Republic%20of%20Central%20Lithuania%20general%20election%2C%201922">a disputed election</a> took place on 8 January 1922, and the territory was annexed to Poland. Żeligowski later in his memoir which was published in London in 1943 condemned the annexation of Republic by Poland, as well as the policy of closing Belarusian schools and general disregard of Marshal <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski">Józef Piłsudski</a>'s confederation plans by Polish ally. Years earlier interrogation report of 19-year-old revolutionary <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski">Pilsudski</a> of March 10, 1887 indicated that he called himself a "belarusian, nobleman".

A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the <a href="Lithuanian%E2%80%93Belorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR</a>. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including <a href="collectivization">collectivization</a> and <a href="Five-Year%20Plans%20for%20the%20National%20Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">five-year plans for the national economy</a>, led to famine and political repression.
In 1939, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the <a href="Peace%20of%20Riga">Peace of Riga</a> two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes <a href="West%20Belarus">West Belarus</a>. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a>. Nazi Germany <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invaded the Soviet Union</a> in 1941. The <a href="Brest%20Fortress">Brest Fortress</a>, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it <a href="Occupation%20of%20Belarus%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">remained in Nazi hands</a> until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi "<a href="Generalplan%20Ost">Generalplan Ost</a>" called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more <a href="Lebensraum">living space</a> in the <a href="Drang%20nach%20Osten">East</a> for Germans.

<a href="World%20War%20II%20casualties%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million</a> (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belarus">Jewish population of Belarus</a> was devastated during <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this conflict that the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory were given to the recently annexed Lithuania.
After the war, Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, on top of the Soviet Union's vote. Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in the western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians. The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn, in accord with the 1919-proposed <a href="Curzon%20Line">Curzon Line</a>.

<a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> implemented a policy of <a href="Sovietization">Sovietization</a> to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from <a href="Western%20world">Western influences</a>. This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government. After Stalin's death in 1953, <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> continued his predecessor's <a href="cultural%20hegemony">cultural hegemony</a> program, stating, "The sooner we all start speaking Russian, the faster we shall build communism."

In 1986, the Byelorussian SSR was exposed to significant <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a> from the explosion at the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl</a> power plant in the neighboring <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Ukrainian SSR</a>.

In June 1988, the archaeologist and leader of the <a href="Conservative%20Christian%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20BPF">Christian Conservative Party of the BPF</a> <a href="Zyanon%20Paznyak">Zyanon Paznyak</a> discovered <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s of victims executed in 1937–41 at <a href="Kurapaty">Kurapaty</a>, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.
In March 1990, elections for seats in the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> of the Byelorussian SSR took place. Though the pro-independence <a href="Belarusian%20Popular%20Front">Belarusian Popular Front</a> took only 10% of the seats, the populace was content with the selection of the delegates. Belarus declared itself sovereign on 1990 by issuing the <a href="Declaration%20of%20State%20Sovereignty%20of%20the%20Belarusian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>.

With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on 1991. <a href="Stanislau%20Shushkevich">Stanislav Shushkevich</a>, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, met with <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> of Russia and <a href="Leonid%20Kravchuk">Leonid Kravchuk</a> of Ukraine on 1991 in <a href="Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa%20Forest">Belavezhskaya Pushcha</a> to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>.

A <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">national constitution</a> was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">President of Belarus</a>.

Two-round elections for the presidency on ( 1994 and 1994) catapulted the formerly unknown <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> into national prominence. He garnered 45% of the vote in the first round and 80% in the second, defeating <a href="Vyachaslau%20Kebich">Vyacheslav Kebich</a> who received 14% of the vote. Lukashenko was re-elected <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">in 2001</a>, <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">in 2006</a>, <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">in 2010</a> and again <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202015">in 2015</a>. Western governments, <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> have criticized Lukashenko's <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> style of government.

Since 2014, following years of embrace of Russian influence in the country, Lukashenko has pressed a revival of Belarusian identity, following the Russian <a href="Annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation">annexation of Crimea</a> and <a href="Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20Ukraine%20%282014%E2%80%93present%29">military intervention in Eastern Ukraine</a>. For the first time, he delivered a speech in <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> (rather than Russian, which most people use), in which he said, "We are not Russian—we are Belarusians", and later encouraged the use of Belarusian. Trade disputes, a border dispute, and a much relaxed official attitude to dissident voices are all part of a weakening of the longtime warm relationship with Russia.

In 2019, Lukashenko had bilateral talks in <a href="Sochi">Sochi</a> with Russian president <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and declared that their two countries "could unite tomorrow, no problem." An idea backed by Putin for years, observers have labeled the potential plan a scheme by Putin to remain in power beyond 2024. However, political scientist <a href="Mikhail%20Vinogradov">Mikhail Vinogradov</a> explained that "Lukashenko will play tough to the public while trying to look weak in front of Putin," and the <a href="Carnegie%20Moscow%20Center">Carnegie Moscow Center</a>'s <a href="Artyom%20Shraibman">Artyom Shraibman</a> suggested that "Moscow will most likely fail to find its base among Belarusians."

Belarus lies between latitudes <a href="51st%20parallel%20north">51°</a> and <a href="57th%20parallel%20north">57° N</a>, and longitudes <a href="23rd%20meridian%20east">23°</a> and <a href="33rd%20meridian%20east">33° E</a>. Its extension from north to south is , from west to east is . It is <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked</a>, relatively flat, and contains large tracts of <a href="marsh">marsh</a>y land. About 40% of Belarus is covered by forests.

Many streams and 11,000 lakes are found in Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman</a>, the <a href="Pripyat%20River">Pripyat</a>, and the <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper</a>. The Neman flows westward towards the Baltic sea and the Pripyat flows eastward to the Dnieper; the Dnieper flows southward towards the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.
The highest point is <a href="Dzyarzhynskaya%20Hara">Dzyarzhynskaya Hara</a> (Dzyarzhynsk Hill) at , and the lowest point is on the Neman River at . The average elevation of Belarus is <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>. The climate features mild to cold winters, with average January minimum temperatures ranging from in southwest (<a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest</a>) to in northeast (<a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>), and cool and moist summers with an average temperature of . Belarus has an average annual rainfall of . The country is in the transitional zone between <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>s and <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime climates</a>.

Natural resources include <a href="peat">peat</a> deposits, small quantities of oil and natural gas, <a href="granite">granite</a>, dolomite (<a href="limestone">limestone</a>), <a href="marl">marl</a>, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl nuclear disaster</a> entered Belarusian territory, and about a fifth of Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of <a href="caesium">caesium</a> binders and <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a> cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a>.

Belarus borders five countries: <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> to the north, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> to the northwest, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> to the west, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the north and the east, and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> to the south. Treaties in 1995 and 1996 demarcated Belarus's borders with Latvia and Lithuania, and Belarus ratified a 1997 treaty establishing the Belarus-Ukraine border in 2009. Belarus and Lithuania ratified final border demarcation documents in February 2007.

Belarus is a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> republic, governed by a <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">president</a> and the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a>. The <a href="term%20of%20office">term</a> for each presidency is five years. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could serve for only two terms as president, but a <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%202004">change in the constitution in 2004</a> eliminated term limits. <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has been the president of Belarus since 1994. In 1996, Lukashenko called for a controversial vote to extend the presidential term from five to seven years, and as a result <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">the election</a> that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. The <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201996">referendum on the extension</a> was denounced as a "fantastic" fake by the chief electoral officer, <a href="Viktar%20Hanchar">Viktar Hanchar</a>, who was removed from the office for official matters only during the campaign. The National Assembly is a <a href="bicameralism">bicameral parliament</a> comprising the 110-member <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belarus">House of Representatives</a> (the lower house) and the 64-member <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">Council of the Republic</a> (the upper house).

The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the <a href="List%20of%20Belarusian%20Prime%20Ministers">prime minister</a>, make constitutional amendments, call for a <a href="Motion%20of%20Confidence">vote of confidence</a> on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.

The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Belarus">Supreme Court</a> and specialized courts such as the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Belarus">Constitutional Court</a>, which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.

In the <a href="Belarusian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202012">2012 parliamentary election</a>, 105 of the 110 members elected to the House of Representatives were not affiliated with any political party. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Belarus">Communist Party of Belarus</a> won 3 seats, and the <a href="Agrarian%20Party%20%28Belarus%29">Agrarian Party</a> and <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Labour%20and%20Justice">Republican Party of Labour and Justice</a>, one each. Most non-partisans represent a wide scope of social organizations such as workers' collectives, public associations, and civil society organizations, similar to the composition of the Soviet legislature.

Neither the pro-Lukashenko parties, such as the <a href="Belarusian%20Socialist%20Sporting%20Party">Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party</a> and the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Labour%20and%20Justice">Republican Party of Labour and Justice</a>, nor the <a href="People%27s%20Coalition%205%20Plus">People's Coalition 5 Plus</a> opposition parties, such as the <a href="Partyja%20BPF">Belarusian People's Front</a> and the <a href="United%20Civil%20Party%20of%20Belarus">United Civil Party of Belarus</a>, won any seats in the <a href="Elections%20in%20Belarus%23Elections%20of%202004">2004 elections</a>. Groups such as the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) declared the election "un-free" because of the opposition parties' poor results and media bias in favor of the government.

In the <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">2006 presidential election</a>, Lukashenko was opposed by <a href="Alaksandar%20Milinkievi%C4%8D">Alaksandar Milinkievič</a>, who represented a coalition of opposition parties, and by <a href="Alaksandar%20Kazulin">Alaksandar Kazulin</a> of the Social Democrats. Kazulin was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the <a href="All%20Belarusian%20People%27s%20Assembly">All Belarusian People's Assembly</a>. Lukashenko won the election with 80% of the vote; the Russian Federation and the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">CIS</a> deemed the vote open and fair while the OSCE and other organizations called the election unfair.

After the December completion of the <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">2010 presidential election</a>, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% of the vote in elections. The runner-up opposition leader <a href="Andrei%20Sannikov">Andrei Sannikov</a> received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.

The judicial system in Belarus lacks independence and is subject to political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and <a href="whistleblower">whistleblower</a> protection and national <a href="ombudsman">ombudsman</a> are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, and the government has made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.

Lukashenko has described himself as having an "authoritarian ruling style". Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship; the government has accused the same Western powers of trying to oust Lukashenko. The <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> has barred Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting and election irregularities in the November 1996 constitutional referendum and parliament by-elections.

The Belarusian government is also criticized for human rights violations and its persecution of non-governmental organisations, independent journalists, national minorities, and opposition politicians. In a testimony to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> labeled Belarus as one of the world's six "<a href="outposts%20of%20tyranny">outposts of tyranny</a>". In response, the Belarusian government called the assessment "quite far from reality". The <a href="Viasna%20Human%20Rights%20Centre">Viasna Human Rights Centre</a> lists 11 political prisoners currently detained in Belarus. Among them is the human rights activist <a href="Ales%20Bialiatski">Ales Bialiatski</a>, Vice President of <a href="International%20Federation%20for%20Human%20Rights">International Federation for Human Rights</a> and head of Viasna.

Lukashenko announced a new law in 2014 that will prohibit <a href="kolkhoz">kolkhoz</a> workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors. The law was compared with <a href="serfdom">serfdom</a> by Lukashenko himself. Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012.

The Byelorussian SSR was one of the two Soviet republics that joined the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> along with the Ukrainian SSR as one of the original 51 members in 1945. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market.

The <a href="union%20of%20Russia%20and%20Belarus">union of Russia and Belarus</a>, a supranational confederation, was established in a 1996–99 series of treaties that called for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy. However, the future of the union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus's repeated delays of monetary union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a <a href="2007%20Russia%E2%80%93Belarus%20energy%20dispute">dispute over the petroleum trade</a>.

On 11 December 2007, reports emerged that a framework for the new state was discussed between both countries. On 2008, Belarusian President Lukashenko said that he had named <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Russia">Russian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> the "prime minister" of the Russia-Belarus alliance. The significance of this act was not immediately clear; some incorrectly speculated that Putin would become president of a unified state of Russia and Belarus after stepping down as Russian president in May 2008.

Belarus was a founding member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS). Belarus has trade agreements with several <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials), including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue.
Bilateral relations with the United States are strained because the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a> supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the <a href="Belarus%20Democracy%20Act%20of%202004">Belarus Democracy Act</a>, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.

Sino-Belarusian relations have improved, strengthened by the visit of President Lukashenko to China in October 2005. Belarus also has strong ties with <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, considered a key partner in the Middle East. In addition to the CIS, Belarus is a member of the <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Community">Eurasian Economic Community</a>, the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a>, the international <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> since 1998, and the <a href="Organization%20on%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe">Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE). As an OSCE member state, Belarus's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the <a href="U.S.%20Helsinki%20Commission">U.S. Helsinki Commission</a>.

Belarus is included in the European Union's <a href="European%20Neighbourhood%20Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

On 15 February 2016 the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> announced the easing of sanctions against Belarus during a meeting by 28 EU foreign ministers at a regular session of the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a>.

Major General <a href="Andrei%20Ravkov">Andrei Ravkov</a> heads the Ministry of Defence, and Alexander Lukashenko (as president) serves as Commander-in-Chief. The armed forces were formed in 1992 using parts of the former <a href="Soviet%20Armed%20Forces">Soviet Armed Forces</a> on the new republic's territory. The transformation of the ex-Soviet forces into the Armed Forces of Belarus, which was completed in 1997, reduced the number of its soldiers by 30,000 and restructured its leadership and military formations.

Most of Belarus's service members are <a href="conscription">conscripts</a>, who serve for 12 months if they have higher education or 18 months if they do not. Demographic decreases in the Belarusians of conscription age have increased the importance of contract soldiers, who numbered 12,000 in 2001. In 2005, about 1.4% of Belarus's gross domestic product was devoted to military expenditure.

Belarus has not expressed a desire to join <a href="NATO">NATO</a> but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997, and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the <a href="ISAF">ISAF</a> mission in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Belarus first began to cooperate with NATO upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995. However, Belarus cannot join NATO because it is a member of the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a>. Tensions between NATO and Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus.

Belarus is divided into six <a href="Oblast">regions</a> (, ), which are named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers.

Each region has a provincial legislative authority, called a region council (, ), which is elected by its residents, and a provincial executive authority called a region administration (, ), whose chairman is appointed by the president. Regions are further subdivided into "<a href="raion">raion</a>s", commonly translated as "districts" (, ).

Each "raion" has its own legislative authority, or "raion" council, (, ) elected by its residents, and an executive authority or "raion" administration appointed by higher executive powers. The six regions are divided into 118 "raions".

The city of Minsk is split into nine districts and enjoys special status as the nation's capital. It is run by an executive committee and has been granted a charter of self-rule.

Belarus is the only European country still using <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>. The <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">U.S.</a> and Belarus were the only two of the 56 member states of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> to have carried out executions during 2011.

In 2014 the share of manufacturing in GDP was 37%, more than two thirds of this amount falls on manufacturing industries. The number of people employed in industry is 32.7% of the working population. The growth rate is much lower than for the economy as a whole – about 1.9% in 2014. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus was one of the world's most industrially developed states by percentage of GDP as well as the richest CIS member-state.

In 2015, 39.3% of Belarusians were employed by state-controlled companies, 57.2% were employed by private companies (in which the government has a 21.1% stake) and 3.5% were employed by foreign companies. The country relies on Russia for various imports, including petroleum. Important agricultural products include potatoes and cattle byproducts, including meat. In 1994, Belarus's main exports included heavy machinery (especially <a href="Belarus%20%28tractor%29">tractors</a>), agricultural products, and energy products.
Economically, Belarus involved itself in the CIS, <a href="Eurasian%20Economic%20Community">Eurasian Economic Community</a>, and <a href="Union%20State">Union with Russia</a>.

In the 1990s, however, industrial production plunged due to decreases in imports, investment, and demand for Belarusian products from its trading partners. GDP only began to rise in 1996; the country was the fastest-recovering former Soviet republic in the terms of its economy. In 2006, GDP amounted to in <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP) dollars (estimate), or about $8,100 per capita. In 2005, GDP increased by 9.9%; the inflation rate averaged 9.5%.

Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, under Lukashenko's leadership, Belarus has maintained government control over key industries and eschewed the large-scale privatizations seen in other former Soviet republics.

In 2006, Belarus's largest trading partner was Russia, accounting for nearly half of total trade, with the European Union the next largest trading partner, with nearly a third of foreign trade. , 38% of Belarusian exported goods go to Russia and 56% of imported goods come from Russia.

Due to its failure to protect labor rights, including passing laws forbidding unemployment or working outside of state-controlled sectors, Belarus lost its EU <a href="Generalized%20System%20of%20Preferences">Generalized System of Preferences</a> status on 2007, which raised tariff rates to their prior <a href="most%20favored%20nation">most favored nation</a> levels. Belarus applied to become a member of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> in 1993.

The labor force consists of more than four million people, among whom women hold slightly more jobs than men. In 2005, nearly a quarter of the population was employed by industrial factories. Employment is also high in agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods, and education. The unemployment rate, according to government statistics, was 1.5% in 2005. There were 679,000 unemployed Belarusians, two-thirds of whom were women. The unemployment rate has been in decline since 2003, and the overall rate of employment is the highest since statistics were first compiled in 1995.

Until 1 July 2016, the currency of Belarus was the <a href="Belarusian%20ruble">Belarusian ruble</a> (BYR). The currency was introduced in May 1992, replacing the <a href="Soviet%20ruble">Soviet ruble</a>. The first coins of the Republic of Belarus were issued on 27 December 1996. The ruble was reintroduced with new values in 2000 and has been in use ever since. As part of the <a href="Union%20State">Union of Russia and Belarus</a>, both states have discussed using a single currency along the same lines as the Euro. This led to a proposal that the Belarusian ruble be discontinued in favor of the <a href="Russian%20ruble">Russian ruble</a> (RUB), starting as early as 2008. The <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Belarus">National Bank of Belarus</a> abandoned pegging the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble in August 2007.

A new currency, the <a href="new%20Belarusian%20ruble">new Belarusian ruble</a> (<a href="ISO%204217">ISO 4217</a> code: BYN) was introduced in July 2016, replacing the <a href="Belarusian%20ruble">Belarusian ruble</a> in a rate of 1:10,000 (10,000 old rubles = 1 new ruble). From 1 July until 31 December 2016, the old and new currencies will be in parallel circulation and series 2000 notes and coins can be exchanged for series 2009 from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021. This <a href="redenomination">redenomination</a> can be considered an effort to fight the high inflation rate.

The banking system of Belarus consists of two levels: Central Bank (National Bank of the Republic of Belarus) and 25 commercial banks. On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper on the black market and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars, euros, durable goods, and canned goods. On 1 June 2011, Belarus requested an economic rescue package from the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>.

According to the National Statistical Committee, , the population is 9.49 million. Ethnic <a href="Belarusians">Belarusians</a> constitute 83.7% of Belarus's total population. The next largest ethnic groups are: <a href="Russians">Russians</a> (8.3%), <a href="Poles">Poles</a> (3.1%), and <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> (1.7%).

Like many other eastern European countries, Belarus has a negative population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its <a href="Total%20fertility%20rate">fertility rate</a> was 1.22, well <a href="Sub-replacement%20fertility">below the replacement rate</a>. Its <a href="net%20migration%20rate">net migration rate</a> is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; the median age of 30–34 is estimated to rise to between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The average life expectancy is 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for women). Over 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are <a href="literate">literate</a>.

Belarus's two official languages are Russian and <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a>; Russian is the most common language used at home, used by 70% of the population, while Belarusian, the official first language, is spoken at home by 23%. Minorities also speak <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Yiddish">Eastern Yiddish</a>. Belarusian, although not as widely used as Russian, is the mother tongue of 53.2% of the population, whereas Russian is the mother tongue of only 41.5%.

According to the census of , 58.9% of all Belarusians adhere to some kind of religion; out of those, <a href="Belarusian%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> (Belarusian Exarchate of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>) makes up about 82%. <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Belarus">Roman Catholicism</a> is practiced mostly in the western regions, and there are also different denominations of Protestantism. Minorities also practice <a href="Greek%20Catholicism">Greek Catholicism</a>, Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism. Overall, 48.3% of the population is Orthodox Christian, 41.1% is not religious, 7.1% is Catholic and 3.3% follows other religions.

Belarus's Catholic minority is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around <a href="Hrodna">Hrodna</a>, is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's <a href="Poles">Polish</a> and <a href="Lithuanian%20people">Lithuanian</a> minorities. In a statement to the media regarding Belarusian-Vatican ties, President Lukashenko stated that Orthodox and Catholic believers are the "two main confessions in our country".

Belarus was once a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the population being <a href="history%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belarus">Jewish</a>. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, deportation, and emigration, so that today it is a very small minority of less than one percent. The <a href="Lipka%20Tatars">Lipka Tatars</a>, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly <a href="Islam%20in%20Belarus">Muslims</a>. According to Article 16 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution</a>, Belarus has no official religion. While the <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of worship</a> is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.

The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the <a href="Slavianski%20Bazaar%20in%20Vitebsk">Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk</a>, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20Independence%20Day">Independence Day</a> and <a href="Victory%20Day%20%289%20May%29">Victory Day</a>, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country.

Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of <a href="Cyril%20of%20Turaw">Cyril of Turaw</a>.

By the 16th century, <a href="Polotsk">Polotsk</a> resident <a href="Francysk%20Skaryna">Francysk Skaryna</a> translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was <a href="Yanka%20Kupala">Yanka Kupala</a>. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as <a href="U%C5%82adzimir%20%C5%BDy%C5%82ka">Uładzimir Žyłka</a>, Kazimir Svayak, <a href="Yakub%20Kolas">Yakub Kolas</a>, <a href="%C5%B9mitrok%20Biadula">Źmitrok Biadula</a>, and <a href="Maksim%20Haretski">Maksim Haretski</a>, wrote for "<a href="Nasha%20Niva">Nasha Niva</a>", a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk.
After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of "Belarusianization" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.

The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by <a href="Vasil%20Byka%C5%AD">Vasil Bykaŭ</a> and <a href="Uladzimir%20Karatkievich">Uladzimir Karatkievich</a>. An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered, was <a href="Ales%20Adamovich">Ales Adamovich</a>. He was named by <a href="Svetlana%20Alexievich">Svetlana Alexievich</a>, the Belarusian winner of the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> 2015, as "her main teacher, who helped her to find a path of her own".
<a href="Music%20of%20Belarus">Music in Belarus</a> largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. In the 19th century, Polish composer <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Moniuszko">Stanisław Moniuszko</a> composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet <a href="Vintsent%20Dunin-Martsinkyevich">Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich</a> and created the opera "Sialanka" ("Peasant Woman"). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet "<a href="Nightingale%20%28ballet%29">Nightingale</a>" by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.

After the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, <a href="Anatoly%20Bogatyrev">Anatoly Bogatyrev</a>, creator of the opera "In Polesye Virgin Forest", served as the "tutor" of Belarusian composers. The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the <a href="Prix%20Benois%20de%20la%20Danse">Benois de la Dance Prize</a> in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world. Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>.

<a href="Marc%20Chagall">Marc Chagall</a> was born in Liozna (near <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>) in 1887. He spent the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> years in Soviet Belarus, becoming one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> and was a founder of the Vitebsk Arts College.

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from <a href="flax">flax</a> or <a href="wool">wool</a>. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns. One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian national flag</a>, adopted in a <a href="Belarusian%20referendum%2C%201995">disputed referendum</a> in 1995.

<a href="Belarusian%20cuisine">Belarusian cuisine</a> consists mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or <a href="stewed">stewed</a>. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals later in the day. <a href="Wheat">Wheat</a> and <a href="rye">rye</a> breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of <a href="bread%20and%20salt">bread and salt</a> when greeting a guest or visitor.

Battle of Bosworth Field

The Battle of Bosworth Field (or Battle of Bosworth) was the last significant battle of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> between the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Houses of Lancaster</a> and <a href="House%20of%20York">York</a> that extended across <a href="England">England</a> in the latter half of the <a href="15th%20century">15th century</a>. Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond</a>, by his victory became the first English monarch of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. His opponent, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a>, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Plantagenet dynasty</a>, making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history.

Richard's reign began in 1483. At the request of his brother <a href="Edward%20IV">Edward IV</a>, Richard was acting as <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a> for his twelve-year-old son <a href="Edward%20V">Edward V</a>. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost popularity when the boy and his younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a>, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of <a href="Market%20Bosworth">Market Bosworth</a> in Leicestershire. <a href="Thomas%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Thomas, Lord Stanley</a>, and <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Battle%20of%20Bosworth%29">Sir William Stanley</a> brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.

Richard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or "battles"). One was assigned to the <a href="John%20Howard%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> and another to the <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced <a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a>. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the King's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.

Henry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age. From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974 the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009 a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location southwest of <a href="Ambion%20Hill">Ambion Hill</a>.

During the 15th century civil war raged across England as the <a href="House%20of%20York">Houses of York</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a> fought each other for the English throne. In 1471 the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Barnet">Barnet</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tewkesbury">Tewkesbury</a>. The Lancastrian <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">King Henry VI</a> and his only son, <a href="Edward%20of%20Westminster%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Edward of Lancaster</a>, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. The Yorkist king, <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a>, was in complete control of England. He <a href="Attainder">attainted</a> those who refused to submit to his rule, such as <a href="Jasper%20Tudor">Jasper Tudor</a> and his nephew <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry</a>, naming them traitors and confiscating their lands. The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds forced them to land in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a>, which was a semi-independent duchy, where they were taken into the custody of <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Duke Francis II</a>. Henry's mother, <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Beaufort">Lady Margaret Beaufort</a>, was a great-granddaughter of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>, uncle of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">King Richard II</a> and father of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">King Henry IV</a>. The Beauforts were originally <a href="Bastard%20%28Law%20of%20England%20and%20Wales%29">bastards</a>, but Henry IV legitimised them on the condition that their descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of the royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and Edward regarded him as "a nobody". The Duke of Brittany, however, viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid in conflicts with France and kept the Tudors under his protection.

Edward IV died 12 years after Tewkesbury on 9 April 1483. His 12-year-old elder son succeeded him as <a href="Edward%20V%20of%20England">King Edward V</a>; the younger son, nine-year-old <a href="Richard%20of%20Shrewsbury%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard of Shrewsbury</a>, was next in line to the throne. Edward V was <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">too young to rule</a> and a <a href="Royal%20Council">Royal Council</a> was established to rule the country until the king's coming of age. Some among the council were worried when it became apparent that the Woodvilles, relatives of Edward IV's widow <a href="Elizabeth%20Woodville">Elizabeth</a>, were plotting to use their control of the young king to dominate the council. Having offended many in their quest for wealth and power, the Woodville family was not popular. To frustrate the Woodvilles' ambitions, <a href="William%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hastings">Lord Hastings</a> and other members of the council turned to the new king's uncle—Richard, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Duke of Gloucester</a>, brother of Edward IV. The courtiers urged Gloucester to assume the role of Protector quickly, as had been previously requested by his now dead brother. On 29 April Gloucester, accompanied by a contingent of guards and <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham</a>, took Edward V into custody and arrested several prominent members of the Woodville family. After bringing the young king to London, Gloucester had two of the Woodvilles (the Queen's brother <a href="Anthony%20Woodville%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Rivers">Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers</a> and her younger son by her first marriage <a href="Richard%20Grey">Richard Grey</a>) executed, without trial, on charges of treason.

On 13 June Gloucester accused Hastings of plotting with the Woodvilles and had him beheaded. Nine days later Gloucester convinced <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> to declare the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth illegal, rendering their children illegitimate and disqualifying them from the throne. With his brother's children out of the way, he was next in the line of succession and was proclaimed King Richard III on 26 June. The timing and extrajudicial nature of the deeds done to obtain the throne for Richard won him no popularity, and rumours that spoke ill of the new king spread throughout England. After they were declared bastards, the two princes were confined in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and never seen in public again.

Discontent with Richard's actions manifested itself in the summer after he took control of the country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian <a href="Charles%20Ross%20%28historian%29">Charles Ross</a> proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.
The plan was to stage uprisings within a short time in southern and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> started 10 days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to <a href="Wem">Wem</a>, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> or <a href="Poole">Poole</a>) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.

The survivors of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry's claim to the throne. At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath to marry Edward IV's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20York">Elizabeth of York</a>, to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from Richard. In mid-1484 Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer <a href="Pierre%20Landais">Pierre Landais</a> took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid. John Morton, a bishop of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France. The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard's England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany. On 16 March 1485 Richard's queen, <a href="Anne%20Neville">Anne Neville</a>, died, and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters, and upset Henry across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV. Anxious to secure his bride, Henry recruited mercenaries formerly in French service to supplement his following of exiles and set sail from France on 1 August.

By the 15th century English <a href="chivalry">chivalric</a> ideas of selfless service to the king had been <a href="Bastard%20feudalism">corrupted</a>. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in individual estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his <a href="Militia%20%28English%29">militia</a>. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the support of his nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.

Small and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors. However, he enjoyed very rough sports and activities that were considered manly. His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward's right-hand man. During the 1480s Richard defended the northern borders of England. In 1482 Edward charged him to lead an army into Scotland with the aim of replacing <a href="James%20III%20of%20Scotland">King James III</a> with the <a href="Alexander%20Stewart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Duke of Albany</a>. Richard's army <a href="Capture%20of%20Berwick%20%281482%29">broke through the Scottish defences and occupied the capital</a>, Edinburgh, but Albany decided to give up his claim to the throne in return for the post of Lieutenant General of Scotland. As well as obtaining a guarantee that the Scottish government would concede territories and diplomatic benefits to the English crown, Richard's campaign retook the town of <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, which the Scots had conquered in 1460. Edward was not satisfied by these gains, which, according to Ross, could have been greater if Richard had been resolute enough to capitalise on the situation while in control of Edinburgh. In her analysis of Richard's character, Christine Carpenter sees him as a soldier who was more used to taking orders than giving them. However, he was not averse to displaying his militaristic streak; on ascending the throne he made known his desire to lead a <a href="Crusades">crusade</a> against "not only the Turks, but all [his] foes".

Richard's most loyal subject was <a href="John%20Howard%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk</a>. The duke had served Richard's brother for many years and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a military veteran, having fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a> in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old <a href="Anne%20de%20Mowbray%2C%208th%20Countess%20of%20Norfolk">Anne de Mowbray</a>, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.

<a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland</a>, also supported Richard's seizure of the throne of England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Marches">Warden of the East March</a>, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, <a href="John%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln</a>, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.

<a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor</a> was unfamiliar with the arts of war and was a stranger to the land he was trying to conquer. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France. Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> and ambassadors like <a href="Pedro%20de%20Ayala">Pedro de Ayala</a> found him more interested in commerce and finance. Having not fought in any battles, Henry recruited several experienced veterans to command his armies. 

<a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">John de Vere</a>, 13th, <a href="Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a>, was Henry's principal military commander. He was adept in the arts of war. At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him. However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford's group came under <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field. The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of <a href="St%20Michael%27s%20Mount">St Michael's Mount</a> in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry's court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler <a href="James%20Blount">Sir James Blount</a>. Oxford's presence raised morale in Henry's camp and troubled Richard III.

In the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, the Stanleys of Cheshire had been predominantly Lancastrians. Sir <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Battle%20of%20Bosworth%29">William Stanley</a>, however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blore%20Heath">Battle of Blore Heath</a> in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471. When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham's rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded. Sir William's elder brother, <a href="Thomas%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley</a>, was not as steadfast. By 1485, he had served three kings, namely <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>, <a href="Edward%20IV">Edward IV</a>, and <a href="Richard%20III">Richard III</a>. <a href="Lord%20Stanley">Lord Stanley</a>'s skilled political manoeuvrings—vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner—gained him high positions; he was Henry's chamberlain and Edward's steward. His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.

<a href="Lord%20Stanley">Lord Stanley</a>'s relations with the king's brother, the eventual <a href="Richard%20III">Richard III</a>, were not cordial. The two had conflicts that erupted into violence around March 1470. Furthermore, having taken <a href="Margaret%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Richmond%20and%20Derby">Lady Margaret</a> as his second wife in June 1472, Stanley was Henry Tudor's stepfather, a relationship which did nothing to win him Richard's favour. Despite these differences, Stanley did not join <a href="Buckingham%27s%20revolt">Buckingham's revolt</a> in 1483. When Richard executed those conspirators who had been unable to flee <a href="England">England</a>, he spared Lady Margaret. However, he declared her titles forfeit and transferred her estates to Stanley's name, to be held in trust for the <a href="Yorkist">Yorkist</a> crown. Richard's act of mercy was calculated to reconcile him with Stanley, but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard's intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family. Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473, but Richard planned to overturn his brother's ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons. Immediately before the Battle of Bosworth, being wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, <a href="George%20Stanley%2C%209th%20Baron%20Strange">Lord Strange</a>, as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.

Henry's initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by <a href="Charles%20VIII%20of%20France">Charles VIII of France</a>. The history of one "John Major" (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians.

Henry's crossing of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in 1485 was without incident. Thirty ships sailed from <a href="Harfleur">Harfleur</a> on 1 August and, with fair winds behind them, landed in his native <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, at Mill Bay (near <a href="Dale%2C%20Pembrokeshire">Dale</a>) on the north side of <a href="Milford%20Haven">Milford Haven</a> on 7 August, easily capturing nearby <a href="Dale%20Castle">Dale Castle</a>. Henry received a muted response from the local population. No joyous welcome awaited him on shore, and at first few individual Welshmen joined his army as it marched inland. Historian <a href="Geoffrey%20Elton">Geoffrey Elton</a> suggests only Henry's ardent supporters felt pride over his Welsh blood. His arrival had been hailed by contemporary Welsh bards such as Dafydd Ddu and Gruffydd ap Dafydd as the true prince and "the youth of Brittany defeating the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>" in order to bring their country back to glory. When Henry moved to <a href="Haverfordwest">Haverfordwest</a>, the county town of <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>, Richard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.

The most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas</a> as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via <a href="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at <a href="Long%20Mountain%20%28Powys%29">Cefn Digoll</a>, <a href="Welshpool">Welshpool</a>. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>.

Since 22 June 1485 Richard had been aware of Henry's impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness. News of Henry's landing reached Richard on 11 August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king's mobilisation. On 16 August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, the assembly point, that night. The city of York, a traditional stronghold of Richard's family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80 men to join the king. Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.

Although London was his goal, Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up <a href="Gilbert%20Talbot%20%28soldier%29">Sir Gilbert Talbot</a> and other English allies, including deserters from Richard's forces. Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry's army was still substantially outnumbered by Richard's forces. Henry's pace through <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause. Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England, and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry's landing. They ranged themselves ahead of Henry's march through the English countryside, meeting twice in secret with Henry as he moved through Staffordshire. At the second of these, at <a href="Atherstone">Atherstone</a> in Warwickshire, they conferred "in what sort to arraign battle with King Richard, whom they heard to be not far off". On 21 August, the Stanleys were making camp on the slopes of a hill north of <a href="Dadlington">Dadlington</a>, while Henry encamped his army at White Moors to the northwest of their camp.
On 20 August, Richard rode from Nottingham to Leicester, joining Norfolk. He spent the night at the Blue Boar inn (demolished 1836). Northumberland arrived the following day. The royal army proceeded westwards to intercept Henry's march on London. Passing <a href="Sutton%20Cheney">Sutton Cheney</a>, Richard moved his army towards <a href="Ambion%20Hill">Ambion Hill</a>—which he thought would be of tactical value—and made camp on it. Richard's sleep was not peaceful and, according to the "<a href="Croyland%20Chronicle">Croyland Chronicle</a>", in the morning his face was "more livid and ghastly than usual".

The Yorkist army, variously estimated at between 7,500 and 12,000 men, deployed on the hilltop along the ridgeline from west to east. Norfolk's group (or "battle" in the parlance of the time) of spearmen stood on the right flank, protecting the cannon and about 1,200 archers. Richard's group, comprising 3,000 infantry, formed the centre. Northumberland's men guarded the left flank; he had approximately 4,000 men, many of them mounted. Standing on the hilltop, Richard had a wide, unobstructed view of the area. He could see the Stanleys and their 4,000–6,000 men holding positions on and around Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry's army.

Henry's force has been variously estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800 French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed the core of Henry's army. <a href="John%20Major%20%28philosopher%29">John Mair</a>, writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component, and this claim is accepted by some modern writers, but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their <a href="Garde%20Ecossaise">elite Scottish knights and archers</a>, and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like <a href="Bernard%20Stewart%2C%20Lord%20of%20Aubigny">Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny</a>.

In their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement. In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood. As Henry's army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, <a href="George%20Stanley%2C%209th%20Baron%20Strange">Lord Strange</a>, if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately. Stanley replied that he had other sons. Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards. Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance. The reply was evasive—the Stanleys would "naturally" come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.

Well aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.

The Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground. Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group, under the command of Sir <a href="Robert%20Brackenbury">Robert Brackenbury</a>, started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men fled the field. Norfolk lost one of his senior officers, <a href="Walter%20Devereux%2C%207th%20Baron%20Ferrers%20of%20Chartley">Walter Devereux</a> in this early clash.

Recognising that his force was at a disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group showed no signs of movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.

At this juncture Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided to end the fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000 knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer <a href="William%20Brandon%20%28standard-bearer%29">Sir William Brandon</a> in the initial charge and unhorsed burly <a href="John%20Cheyne%2C%20Baron%20Cheyne">John Cheyne</a>, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with a blow to the head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.

Oxford had left a small reserve of <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pike</a>-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some critical time. The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. Meanwhile, seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move and rode to the aid of Henry. Now outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back. Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh, into which the king's horse toppled. Richard, now unhorsed, gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: "God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one." In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir <a href="Percival%20Thirlwall">Percival Thirlwall</a>—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed. It is likely that <a href="James%20Harrington%20%28Yorkist%20knight%29">James Harrington</a> also died in the charge. The king's trusted advisor <a href="Richard%20Ratcliffe">Richard Ratcliffe</a> was also slain.

<a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a>, Henry Tudor's official historian, recorded that "King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies". Richard had come within a sword's length of Henry Tudor before being surrounded by Sir William Stanley's men and killed. The Burgundian chronicler <a href="Jean%20Molinet">Jean Molinet</a> says that a Welshman struck the death-blow with a <a href="halberd">halberd</a> while Richard's horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king's helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet <a href="Guto%27r%20Glyn">Guto'r Glyn</a> implies the leading Welsh Lancastrian <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Rhys ap Thomas</a>, or one of his men, killed the king, writing that he "killed the boar, shaved his head". Analysis of <a href="Exhumation%20and%20reburial%20of%20Richard%20III%20of%20England">King Richard's skeletal remains</a> found 11 wounds, nine of them to the head; a blade consistent with a halberd had sliced off part of the rear of Richard's skull, suggesting he had lost his helmet.

Richard's forces disintegrated as news of his death spread. Northumberland and his men fled north on seeing the king's fate, and Norfolk was killed.

After the battle, Richard's <a href="circlet">circlet</a> is said to have been found and brought to Henry, who was proclaimed king at the top of Crown Hill, near the village of Stoke Golding. According to Vergil, Henry's official historian, Lord Stanley found the circlet. Historians Stanley Chrimes and Sydney Anglo dismiss the legend of the circlet's finding in a <a href="Crataegus">hawthorn bush</a>; none of the contemporary sources reported such an event. Ross, however, does not ignore the legend. He argues that the hawthorn bush would not be part of Henry's coat of arms if it did not have a strong relationship to his ascendance. Baldwin points out that a hawthorn bush motif was already used by the House of Lancaster, and Henry merely added the crown.

In Vergil's chronicle, 100 of Henry's men, compared to 1,000 of Richard's, died in this battle—a ratio Chrimes believes to be an exaggeration. The bodies of the fallen were brought to St James Church at Dadlington for burial. However, Henry denied any immediate rest for Richard; instead the last Yorkist king's corpse was stripped naked and strapped across a horse. His body was brought to Leicester and openly exhibited to prove that he was dead. Early accounts suggest that this was in the major Lancastrian collegiate foundation, the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Annunciation%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Newarke">Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke</a>. After two days, the corpse was interred in a plain tomb, within the church of the <a href="Greyfriars%2C%20Leicester">Greyfriars</a>. The church was demolished following the friary's <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution</a> in 1538, and the location of Richard's tomb was long uncertain.

On 12 September 2012 archaeologists announced <a href="Exhumation%20and%20reburial%20of%20Richard%20III%20of%20England">the discovery of a buried skeleton</a> with spinal abnormalities and head injuries under a car park in Leicester, and their suspicions that it might be Richard III. On 4 February 2013, it was announced that DNA testing had convinced <a href="University%20of%20Leicester">Leicester University</a> scientists and researchers "beyond reasonable doubt" that the remains were those of King Richard. On 26 March 2015, these remains were ceremonially buried in <a href="Leicester%20Cathedral">Leicester Cathedral</a> On the following day Richard's tomb was unveiled.

Henry dismissed the mercenaries in his force, retaining only a small core of local soldiers to form a "<a href="Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">Yeomen of his Garde</a>", and proceeded to establish his rule of England. Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess. The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin. Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle, enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field. Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name. The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.

Of his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously. Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates. Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as <a href="Constable%20of%20the%20Tower">Constable of the Tower</a> and admiral of England, Ireland, and <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford. He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament's declaration of Margaret as "<a href="femme%20sole">femme sole</a>" effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley. Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.

Like the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; <a href="Lambert%20Simnel">Lambert Simnel</a> claimed to be <a href="Edward%20Plantagenet%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a>, who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York. The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stoke%20Field">Battle of Stoke Field</a> on 16 June 1487. Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men, including several former supporters of Richard III. Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow. A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.

Contemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English "<a href="Croyland%20Chronicle">Croyland Chronicle</a>", written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers. The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera. Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard, Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light. Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable, compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants. However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources. Ross finds the poem, "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">The Ballad of Bosworth Field</a>", a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle. Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian <a href="Michael%20Hicks%20%28historian%29">Michael Hicks</a>, the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.

Henry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a "modern age" with its dawn in 1485. Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian <a href="Bernard%20Andr%C3%A9">Bernard André</a>, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years. As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. For England the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> ended in 1485, and <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> claims that other than <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>'s successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">invasion</a> of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. According to <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">Reader</a> Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his "Henry VII" (1502). For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because "the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side."

Historians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned. According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was "the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry". Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a>, who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published <a href="Thomas%20Malory">Thomas Malory</a>'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal—"<a href="Le%20Morte%20d%27Arthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a>"—seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.

Elton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.

Mackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years. Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about "the fall of a tyrant".

<a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>". It is the "one big battle"; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action, represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III. Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the "unequivocal triumph of good over evil". Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, "<a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%203">Henry VI, Part 3</a>", as a "formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader"—in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in "Richard III". Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.
Shakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a>'s and <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a>, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a> died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in "Henry VI". Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.

The fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage ("alarums" or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more "alarums" after Richard's councillor, <a href="William%20Catesby">William Catesby</a>, announces that the king is "[enacting] more wonders than a man". Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, "A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!" He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five <a href="Political%20decoy">decoys</a> at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention. He drew inspiration from <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a>'s use of them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shrewsbury">Battle of Shrewsbury</a> (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield. Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation. "<a href="The%20True%20Tragedy%20of%20Richard%20III">The True Tragedy of Richard III</a>", by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.
Despite the dramatic licences taken, Shakespeare's version of the Battle of Bosworth was the model of the event for English textbooks for many years during the 18th and 19th centuries. This glamorised version of history, promulgated in books and paintings and played out on stages across the country, perturbed humorist <a href="Gilbert%20Abbott%20%C3%A0%20Beckett">Gilbert Abbott à Beckett</a>. He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a "fifth-rate production of "Richard III"": shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.

In <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s <a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">1955 film adaptation</a> of "Richard III", the Battle of Bosworth is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film's most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre. The film depicts the clash between the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies on an open field, focusing on individual characters amidst the savagery of hand-to-hand fighting, and received accolades for the realism portrayed. One reviewer for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" newspaper, however, was not impressed, finding the number of combatants too sparse for the wide plains and a lack of subtlety in Richard's death scene. The means by which Richard is shown to prepare his army for the battle also earned acclaim. As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed. Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> and his "band of brothers".

The adaptation of the setting for "Richard III" to a 1930s fascist England in <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>'s <a href="Richard%20III%20%281995%20film%29">1995 film</a>, however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, "nobly and with dignity". By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain. Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.

Officially the site of the battle is deemed by <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Council">Leicestershire County Council</a> to be in the vicinity of the town of <a href="Market%20Bosworth">Market Bosworth</a>. The council engaged historian Daniel Williams to research the battle, and in 1974 his findings were used to build the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and the presentation it houses. Williams's interpretation, however, has since been questioned. Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985, a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory. In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland. <a href="Landscape%20archaeology">Landscape archaeologist</a> <a href="Glenn%20Foard">Glenn Foard</a>, leader of the survey, said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W), contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.

The <a href="Historic%20Buildings%20and%20Monuments%20Commission%20for%20England">Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England</a> (popularly referred to as "English Heritage") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century. As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually <a href="toponymy">toponymical</a> in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question. Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with "Brownehethe", ""bellum Miravallenses"", "Sandeford" and "Dadlyngton field". The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York, locates the battle "on the field of Redemore". This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions "Redesmore" as its site. According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with "Bosworth" until 1510.

Foss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for "Redemore" as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from ""Hreod Mor"", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means "reedy marshland". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes "Redemore" was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of <a href="Dadlington">Dadlington</a>, and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman road</a> running east to west across the region. Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield. Williams dismisses the notion of "Redmore" as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records. Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by <a href="William%20Hutton%20%28Birmingham%20historian%29">William Hutton</a>'s 1788 "The Battle of Bosworth-Field", which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the <a href="River%20Sence">River Sence</a>. Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s 1577 "Chronicle". Holinshed wrote, "King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest." Foss believes that Hutton mistook "field" to mean "field of battle", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To "[pitch] his field", as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.
Foss brings further evidence for his "Redemore" theory by quoting <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a>'s 1550 "Chronicle". Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian <a href="William%20Burton%20%28antiquary%29">William Burton</a>, author of "Description of Leicestershire" (1622), wrote that the battle was "fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three miles [5 km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of <a href="Shenton">Shenton</a>, Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]". In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.

English Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss. The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been <a href="Land%20improvement">improved</a> to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the <a href="Ashby%20Canal">Ashby Canal</a> carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the <a href="Ashby%20and%20Nuneaton%20Joint%20Railway">Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway</a> crossed the area on an embankment. The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.
Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on Ambion Hill, near Richard's Well. According to legend, Richard III drank from one of the several springs in the region on the day of the battle. In 1788, a local pointed out one of the springs to Hutton as the one mentioned in the legend. A stone structure was later built over the location. The inscription on the well reads:

Northwest of Ambion Hill, just across the northern tributary of the , a flag and memorial stone mark Richard's Field. Erected in 1973, the site was selected on the basis of Williams's theory. St James's Church at Dadlington is the only structure in the area that is reliably associated with the Battle of Bosworth; the bodies of those killed in the battle were buried there.

The very extensive survey carried out (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually to the discovery of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometer further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was at the time of the battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.

A new interpretation of the battle now integrates the historic accounts with the battlefield finds and landscape history. The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometers to the southwest of Ambion Hill. 
Based on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III's army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh. Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.

Tudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire. 
The Stanleys were positioned on the south side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.

Northumberland failed to engage, possibly due to the presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what came to be known as Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.

The windmill close to which the Duke of Norfolk is said to have died (according to the ballad "Lady Bessy") was Dadlington windmill. This has disappeared but is known to have stood at the time of the battle, in the vicinity of Apple Orchard Farm and North Farm, Dadlington. A small cluster of significant finds was made in this area, including a gold livery badge depicting an eagle. The windmill lay between the core battlefield and Richard's camp on Ambion Hill and the rout of Norfolk's vanguard was in this direction. This also accounts for the large number of dead in Dadlington parish, leading to the setting up of the battle chantry there.

Historic England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site. There are hopes that public access to the site may be possible in the future.
